 Dear brothers and sisters, now I'm on the mission to French Polynesia, I'm now on the
 island of Tahiti, and behind me is another island of Mo'orea. This is a very beautiful
 scenery here, birds, and there was no mission here in the past, so hopefully this blessed
 land can also have Orthodox Christians, and please pray for this, pray for me, for this
 mission, and here in the middle of the Pacific is still the land which needs the word of
 God. Hopefully it will bring fruit. God bless everyone.
