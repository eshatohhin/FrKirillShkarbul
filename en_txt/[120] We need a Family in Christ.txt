 Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm in Kaohsiung, this is in the south of Taiwan,
 and we just had a divine service here with a group of faithful which is quite
 small, but it still exists even though there is no priest here only like all
 the time, but the group is still existing and it is very impressive how this group
 formed from nothing, it was just a few scattered individuals but slowly step by
 step it became such a group, such a family of faithful and now we gather, we
 gather, we don't have a church, we gather in a restaurant which is run by one of
 the faithful, so it is really very similar to this early church experience
 when people they gathered in those halls, those you know dining halls, but they
 had very strong love towards each other and we can read in Acts 4 32 that many
 of the faithful of those who believed they had one heart and one soul and
 nobody called nothing of his property his home, but rather everything they had
 was common, this is like really one family, now in the family usually we
 also don't say it's mine, it's yours, in a Christian family that's very faithful,
 we are not really distinguishing, this is mine, this is yours, so this family, do we
 have it now, do we have such families now on the parish level, on a level that is
 above just our own little family of relatives, that really depends on
 each other, we cannot do otherwise, even within the families we don't have
 very good relationships now, a lot of trust and mutual understanding and
 love, but even less on the parish level, so people come, they consider it's my
 thing, I talk to God and it's finished, I go and that's it and I don't want to
 stay for a common meal, it's not my thing, I just think to God and now I
 go back, this is really very strange, because we need to have this family, the
 Lord tells us that we are saved in this family, within this family, without this
 family, you will be lost, you cannot really have this growth in Christ, so we
 need to strive for this, maybe if we don't have such parish life, we should
 not just blame, a priest is like that, or other people are like that, selfish,
 egoistic, but we need to begin with ourselves, what can we do, maybe we can
 contribute somehow, some initiative, let's get together, let's care for someone, do
 something, some common project, talk to priest, offer some help,
 some contribution, for what is perfect, so that is very important, we should
 kill this egoistic thinking, and this thinking that I'm the smartest and
 everybody else is just a problem, they will ask me something, it's just a hassle,
 that's why I keep alone, I keep social distance, this stupid phrase,
 social distance, we don't need social distance in the church, so in the
 ancient times we see that the whole society had such groups, such families,
 that they were uniting people, not just on family level, but on the higher level,
 in the very ancient time in Greece there were this Polish culture, that they had
 Athens, other big cities, and the whole city gathered together, the noblemen,
 the citizens, not the slaves, they gathered together and they
 discussed altogether things, what we need to do, what happens, and that
 was their social life, later this culture diminished, but in the Greek or
 Roman culture, those small congregations, brotherhoods, or different corporations,
 they get together, Collegia, they had many different names, Hateria,
 those fraternitas, those groups, they get together, it was usually not more than 50
 people, and they also discussed things, they had social life, they allowed for
 recognition of their members by this group, help to those who are poor, poor
 members, they provided a lot of growth and the self-expression opportunities for
 them, so people could really grow, they had this support, they always provided
 for burial expenses, if somebody died, so that was in many ways their family
 above family, and later the church, the early Christians, they got into such
 communities, and this, for the Christians, this replaced those pagan communities
 and brotherhoods, it was instead of that, but it had a very similar
 social role, but in the church they also feel this mystical union with God,
 when they gather together in such communities, this is what we are lacking
 right now, this family, every one of us, we need to strive to be
 willing to have such a family, beginning with ourselves, contribute to
 such purpose, and it's not like Facebook, that's all fake, it's
 replacing, not some other groups, again, our main family, other than our
 family, the relatives, should be related to Christ somehow, otherwise
 it's just some club, we can participate in all kinds of associations
 and things like that, but this should not become our family, our true
 family, on this social level, has to be related to Christ somehow, St.
 Nicholas of Serbia, he is telling us that, he is calling the audience, the
 reader, "Brethren, brethren, let us do this, brethren, do you see this?" and we
 feel that from him it's not just some protocol thing, or some
 rhetoric, calling Ladies and Gentlemen, it has this feeling that he
 is an elder member of the family, he cares for us as our elder brother, as
 someone who is in very close relationship with us, spiritual
 relationship, even though he passed away 70 years ago or so, so this is telling us
 that the family is bigger than only people in my city, the Orthodox people,
 the family that I have, everything includes saints, includes the faithful, or
 already advanced away, in the Ephesians we read that they had, the Apostle Paul
 says that you became co-citizens with the saints, well we are same family with
 the saints through rejecting this world, through being born again, we need to
 feel that affiliation, this relationship with our saints also, so it should
 make us find friends there, not only among the leading members of the
 parish community, so we should not always say "oh there is no people like
 that in my town" or "forget about it", no there is always people, because
 it's the sum of many members, it's more than just a sum, it's the synthesis,
 so 1 plus 1 equals 2, it's 1 plus 1 equals more, it's more, it's giving us
 much more, and we know that this works even in the secular world, because all
 those brotherhoods and these clubs, they have such a power, now we have those
 Lions clubs, this Masons, we have Catholics with orders, they go
 to different countries and do many projects, so it's really a big power,
 much bigger than just one person, the same works with people in Christ, when
 we are together, we can be a really strong force against evil, against devil
 in this world, it will help both us and the whole world, this is very very
 important, now we are scattered, we're scattered, everybody thinks
 that he is maybe the smartest, or that everybody else will betray him, so he's
 suspicious, and this really makes us so weak, because one person, any time
 something happens, he's off, he's out of the game, but with the
 family we can keep going, we can do many things, like an army of Christ, a battalion,
 and form like a battalion, so I really advise that the Orthodox, we can form
 more associations, not only on a parish level, these families, we can also
 have an association of entrepreneurs, Orthodox entrepreneurs, or
 writers, or editors, publishers, people for publishing Orthodox books,
 brotherhoods like that, such brotherhoods, they played a big role in
 Ukraine, when it was part of Poland, and the Catholic pressure was very great, it
 is these brotherhoods who are publishing books, they were able, they didn't have
 even priests, but they were able, even though small, to keep the faith, to
 fight this power, cultural, political, that was trying to invade them.
 We can also have brotherhoods for pilgrimage, for some trips, for
 volunteers, who do some volunteer work, or missionaries, this also needs
 that union, maybe researchers, research divine
 liturgy, study divine liturgy, architects, it can be anything, in the
 spirit of love, not bureaucratic thing, it's a bureaucratic thing, not to show off, to
 get together, some photos, Facebook, and things like that, no, but to do this
 family union of Christians in Christ, united by Christ, for some specific
 purposes, it was almost destroyed, in Orthodox countries, this Soviet system,
 in the communist system, in many places, it was just destroyed, anything,
 any kind of gathering, even the kitchen was made very small, so you
 cannot get more than two, three people in that kitchen, so this is a
 big problem that we have now, that everybody is scattered, all the
 brotherhoods were destroyed, the Kazakhs groups were destroyed, those fundraising
 clubs for sponsoring some activities, that was destroyed, some
 other unions for pilgrimage, for the Holy Land, almost everything was
 destroyed, the noble people were destroyed, so it is really important
 that we are not just mass, mass culture, or mass becomes also atomized,
 atomized people, who think in the same way, because they watch the same thing,
 they have very similar things, so let us unite, and not just Facebook, not
 just those, it's really fake, it's not real love and real union, we should not
 be afraid of people who train us, even Christ, he was not afraid of Judas, he
 took him everywhere, he taught him everything, he knew everything, if he
 betrayed him, we should not be afraid of that, we should not be thinking, oh
 now we trust each other and something will happen, we just do, we just do
 things, we ourselves have to be not loyal, not betrayers, and everything else in
 the Lord's hands, so let us have such a wide open heart, embracing, being open to
 other people, especially to the Orthodox who are also called by Christ for
 salvation, and we will be forming such groups and we will reach great results,
 bring much bigger fruits of faith that the Lord is expecting from us, may the
 Lord help us, give us such blessing and such heart, ministry, serving, sacrificing
 ourselves, amen, God bless.
