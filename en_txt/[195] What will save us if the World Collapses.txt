 dear brothers and sisters some people ask me if this year will be worse than
 the last year because there are different forecasts saying that economics
 will melt down, there will be a financial reform, maybe everything will collapse
 and then there will be electronic currency and which will control
 everybody and what else? Big war, big internet shutdown, power shutdown or
 maybe another big pandemics breaking out or something like that. Well, what I feel
 is much more important is that we keep ourselves, our hearts free of the spirit
 of Antichrist and if we can reach this goal then whatever happens, okay, we will
 be with Christ and we will not receive the delusion that will be everywhere, okay?
 Well, regarding the last times, okay, we can read the holy people, the holy
 fathers who tell us about what will be happening, okay? We know the Revelation,
 book of Revelation, but also many holy people, for example, Saint Ephraim the
 Syrian, he wrote about this and there is English, this is Russian version, there is
 English version, he is writing quite a few works on Antichrist and only coming
 of Christ and what will be happening on those days and I can tell you it's now
 not as bad yet, okay, as what he is describing there. So we're coming there,
 we're getting there, okay, but it's not yet, okay, it doesn't mean we need to
 relax, okay, but we need to be on guard, okay, and we don't need to go into this
 paranoid, you know, fears. What he says, for example, just a few things,
 he says that the injustice of this world has reached its completion and
 everywhere all kinds of terrible things are happening, fearful and every face is
 running tears, is full of tears and is asking is there anywhere the Word of God
 and the answer is nowhere, okay, you cannot find. So nowhere there is the voice of
 true testimony of the gospel, okay, people don't find it, people are looking for
 the truth but they don't find it, okay, we're not there yet but it's coming, okay,
 now to find the preaching of the gospel that is not mixed with some
 kind of heresy or politics or some kind of manipulation, okay, there is something
 fake about it, it's so difficult to find, okay, already now, okay, and I'm not
 talking about heterodox, these communities which are completely tied with
 all kinds of error and with all kinds of worldliness, okay, they're talking
 about anything but true gospel, self-sacrifice and even within the
 Orthodox Church is becoming more and more difficult to find the uncorrupted,
 undiluted and polluted testimony about Christian faith, okay, and even in the
 19th century we read one of the great saints of the church, Saint Ignatius
 Brancheninov, Bishop of Caucasus, he writes that even at that time the house
 of God, which is the church on earth, is in a terrible situation, it's already
 quite weak and wounded, okay, at that time and now it's even worse, okay, now we're
 in the 21st century and, okay, problems that he's talking about in his
 reflection in those days, now we think it's, okay, we cannot even talk about
 that because now we have things which are much much worse, so we should not be
 too rosy about things, okay, Antichrist is working, okay, he's trying to spoil the
 Christians, including Orthodox Christians, the society now, okay, if you read
 Fr. Serafim Rose, of course he writes a little bit, maybe too much, okay, he is
 putting too much fears about what's going on out there, but myself I think
 that the biggest problem is inside, it's not outside, it's inside each of every
 one of us, but, okay, he is also talking about these problems outside society, how
 spoiled, corrupted, anti-Christian, post-Christian, post-modern, capitalist,
 post-capitalist, okay, he's writing about all these cults and new age and many
 other neo-paganism and many other things, okay, and which are totally spoiling
 children, okay, from early childhood and making everybody corrupt and slave of
 sin and passion with hacked mind, okay, and this is what we have now. Now we basically
 we've reached end of capitalism and going beyond, and what is beyond, because
 beyond will be some kind of neo-socialism which will be totalitarian,
 okay, in essence, and it will be, okay, it will be this spirit of
 Antichrist behind this AI and behind all these things, will be the spirit of AI
 trying to control everything, okay, and people are supposed to be happy and most
 people will be happy, I guess, okay, but they will live in this paradigm of this
 anti-Christian world which will have nothing related to God and Christ with
 true God, not this pagan god that, okay, they say they have, okay, many
 people, everybody is talking about God, but most of the time it's a pantheist,
 pantheistic idea, it is Hegel, okay, this geist, okay, which is basically a devil,
 okay, they go there, they talk about this, it's devil, okay, to put it simple. So what
 do we do, okay, what do we do, how do we face this? I believe that there are
 three things that every, each and every one of us has to have in his life, all
 the time, okay, all the time. Unless we have it, no matter how smart we are, how
 many books we read, how many, I don't know, how much protection you have insurance
 or you buy stuff to safeguard against apocalypse, you have guns, you have
 whatever to protect yourself, this will be nothing, okay, unless you have these
 three things, okay, the first is the Holy Gospel, the Holy Gospel has to be the
 book, we have to open it every day, our heart has to live in the gospel and the
 words of the Lord should be in us all the time, we should be thinking what he
 said, what he's done, okay, what, how can we improve, okay, Saint Servim of
 Sarov, he said that the Christian heart is flowing in the words of the Holy
 Scripture, so this for us would have, has to be the departing point, okay, another must, okay,
 the Holy Eucharist, the Holy Eucharist has to become for us the basis of our
 spiritual life and of everything else, unless we commune regularly, prepare well,
 confess, receive the Holy Communion, we will be alienated from Christ no matter
 how hard we try to be with him, okay, but we will be away and what this means also
 is that we are part of the church life, that we participate in the divine
 liturgy of the church, we are part of the community of the people of God, okay, we
 don't just live individually myself and that's it, no, we are members of the Holy
 Church, of the Holy Tradition, of the prayer of the church, of the common
 prayer of the church, okay, we have to be part of and within the church inside the
 divine liturgy, inside this supper of the Lord, we partake in this supper of the
 Lord and we partake of the body and blood of Jesus Christ on the regular
 basis, okay, this has to be, and of course I'm talking about the Orthodox Church, I
 strongly believe, I'm convinced, okay,
 hundred percent, two hundred percent that the true Church of Christ is the
 Orthodox Church and outside of the Orthodox Church we respect, we respect
 that people believe in Christ, they pray, they read the Bible, but this is not
 enough, this is not enough, and this is why the spirit of delusion is ruling in all those
 communities, in all those organizations, it's totally spoiling everything that
 comes from the Lord, misleading, perverting the truth, okay, of the gospel.
 So this is the second necessary, and the third is the prayer, the prayer has to
 become, okay, necessary basis of our life, everyday life, Holy Communion, we don't
 partake every day, but the prayer and the gospel we read every day, and it's not
 just mechanical reading, okay, it has to, we have to learn how to pray, and without
 praying daily, several times a day, as often as we can, we will not learn to
 pray, we cannot learn how to talk with God, how to listen to him, what he is
 answering, how to have peace of heart capable of talking to him, facing him,
 this has to become for us something that is always with us, wherever we go,
 whatever we do, morning prayer, evening prayer, there is some minimum rule that
 we have to do, we are tired, we don't have time, no, this we stop, we cancel
 everything we do, okay, this is prayer that I have to do today, if we have more
 time we do more, okay, but there is a minimum that we do all the time, okay,
 because we love the Lord, we want to be with him, okay, because we trust him, we
 trust that he is hearing us, no matter what his answer is gonna be, but he is
 hearing us, he's with us, we pray to him, we talk to him every day, Jesus prayer,
 okay, this is also great to practice, and if we have these three things, okay,
 if we have these three things, of course, there will be more fruits of faith that
 we'll be producing, we will learn how to become more righteous, more
 honest, okay, selfless, fight with selfishness, with all kinds of
 temptations, lust, anger, all kinds of things, okay, we will be able to fight
 with that, we will be able to bring fruits in spiritual life, to help others,
 to sacrifice ourselves for others, to learn more about spirituality,
 about the Lord, we will be embracing, looking for everything that's related to
 faith, the works of the Holy Fathers, theological lectures, books, articles, we
 will be searching for lives of saints, what they've done, what they said, what
 they wrote, many other things, okay, so, but these three things is a in a nutshell,
 okay, this is the summary of what we have to have in our life to provide for the
 basis for salvation, for following Christ, for finding this narrow gates, he said,
 you have to strive to enter through narrow gates, okay, if we don't strive, if
 we don't put effort, we will not find these gates and we will not enter into
 those gates and to walk a narrow and difficult path, okay, this path to
 salvation, it's very narrow and not many people want to follow this path,
 everybody runs the Broadway, okay, to partition and he will be catching, okay,
 and this year is gonna be, he's gonna open the new, okay, new cage, if you will,
 new gap for receiving all those who choose not to be with Christ, who let
 the spirit of Antichrist work in them and guide them and rule their intentions,
 motivations, they become their guide and their Lord, but we want Christ
 himself to be our guide and our Lord, may the Lord give us his wisdom, give us his
 Holy Spirit, save us from all delusion, keep us vigilant spiritually and give us
 the joy of his coming, give us the joy of salvation, the joy of his resurrection
 and the power that we need so much to go through these challenges to his glory, to
 be his true witnesses, true followers, may this be so, to the Lord's glory, I mean,
 may the Lord's blessing and strength and wisdom be with every one of you, I mean,
 God bless.
