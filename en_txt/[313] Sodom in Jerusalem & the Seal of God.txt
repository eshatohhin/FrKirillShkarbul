Dear brothers and sisters, now we are in the Apostles fast, and we think deeply what does it mean to be the Apostles of the Lord, to bring this testimony. Today I want to share with you about the two witnesses of the last days, okay, the two witnesses of the book of Apocalypse, who were fighting for the souls of men and who were killed by the beast from the bottomless pit, okay, from this chest. And we think about this, because now is the time when we need to gain the seal from the Lord, okay, in the book of Revelation we also see that not all the Christians will receive the seal from God, okay, and the seal of God will make those very few chosen Christians, okay, to be defended, protected from some evils, like from those locusts and other things, okay, and also they will not receive this mark of the beast, okay, and also there is this concept that this time when the seals can be still placed on you is running out, okay, and at some point finished, okay, no more seals, no more stamping, and then at that point it will be too late, okay. 

So now, brothers and sisters, let us be concerned about this, okay, this should be our main concern, am I sealed, how can I be sealed, and also not to lose this seal, okay, because any day I can lose it, okay, it's really fearful words, but we can lose this seal any day, brothers and sisters, the Lord may say, okay, now I understand, no, not you. And also, we need to get into this love relationship with Him, okay, because if you don't love Him, how can you be sealed, how can you be with Him in the everlasting life, okay, but brothers and sisters, if we are serious, we will think about it, we don't love Him, which is terrifying, okay, because we love everything else, because if you would love someone, you would be trying to communicate with Him anytime, to know more, to approach Him all the time, and also to receive some love back, you would be craving for that outcome, you know, but we ourselves, okay, we are captured by all kinds of stuff, and today we'll see what is that, which is capturing it, okay, and which is eventually pulling most Christians, people who call themselves Christians, away from God, okay, there is this image of that white stone, which is given to some people, and whoever receives this white stone, he will find some name written on it, but no one else can understand it, so this is this intimate relationship between man and God, between true Christians, those who truly love Christ, and the ones who are just, you know, for some reason, either never been Christian, or have fallen away, okay, so today I want to share with you something, which comes from the scripture, okay, but it's related to the world events going on right now, because for us, we should not be, okay, only, you know, watching the news, and being concerned what's happening, this and that, economy, and other stuff, what is going on, and then sometimes, okay, read some little bit of Bible, should be the other way around, we always are in the Bible, in the scripture, in the word of God, in the prayer, but sometimes, we look out of the window, we see something going on, and it's actually what is told to us in the Bible, so this is how this happened to me regarding this Iran war, which just broke up, broke out, recently, and then seized the kingdom, but we see that it's not gonna stop, the whole situation is not resolved, okay, it will have other consequences, and big ones, okay, so, and this happened exactly when I was reading and researching one part, which is in the Revelation book 11, regarding those two witnesses, and let us read that, please, okay, I won't talk now about the witnesses, which is also important, but this is not the topic today, well, those witnesses, they could not be killed by any man, okay, for some reason, of course, men did not want them, okay, they loved the devil, they loved sin, okay, the whole world was grasped by that spirit of Antichrist, they were, became all worshipers of him, but now, all of a sudden, come these two witnesses, and they are so powerful in every respect, that nobody can do anything to them, but then comes who? then comes the beast from the bottomless pit, okay, and this beast, it will kill him, okay, let us read this, please, it's Revelation 11, 7 to 8, and when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them, and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom, and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified, this place is full of important clues, okay, well, first of all, who is this beast? well, this beast is the devil, who is ascended, he's coming out, it's not that he came out, he's coming out from that bottomless pit, which is hell, okay, and this beast was able to kill the two witnesses, maybe with the help of Antichrist, we don't know the details, okay, here the symbology is important, first thing is this beast coming out of the precipice, what is this? who is that? what is this practically? the holy fathers tell us that this is the devil, of course, it's the devil, but this coming out of the precipice is the situation, is the state of the hearts of humanity, that human hearts became this precipice, and this is why the Lord allows him to come out and to kill these witnesses, unless the Lord would allow this to happen, this would never have happened, okay, he's just a creature, the devil is nothing, he's just a creature, but he's able to do that only because the Lord allows, the Lord can see the hearts of man everywhere, everyone, and everyone, almost everyone, his heart is this precipice, brothers and sisters, just think about it, why are people now so much addicted to gaming, to social media, to all this scrolling, tiktok and movies and all, they can be hours in there, that is the precipice, the precipice is attractive, it's grasping your heart, okay, it doesn't let it go, and at some point that will be it, everybody is going to be there, and because people's hearts are away, they've turned away from God, and they are locked in that precipice, the beast from the precipice is coming out, and he's able to kill the two witnesses, and he will win over the saints, this is why, brothers and sisters, if you really want to defend yourself from the devil, it's not about gathering, I don't know, some long-lasting food in your basement, okay, or hoarding something, I don't know, some resources, or some ammunition, guns, no, it's not about that, it's about whether your heart is in this precipice or not, this is about every evening, if you're stuck to that social media and other stuff and cannot stop scrolling all that garbage, this is where the precipice is, okay, just be aware of that, and this is where there will be this decision made, if the Lord will give you this stamp or he will not, you're choosing those evil spirits, you are enjoying that, you want that, okay, I let you have it, okay, just have it as much as you want, but I go away, so, brothers and sisters, now is this time, is this time of choice, so, then, let's talk about Jerusalem, okay, because in this following verse, we see that their bodies will be dropped, their corpses are dropped on the streets, in the streets, that is public, publicly visible, of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was killed, brothers and sisters, all the holy fathers from the second century onwards, all of them tell us that this is the real Israel, the real Jerusalem, it's not just symbol, and that will become the capital of the whole world, at some point, and it will become the Egypt and Sodom, and, okay, it's going there already, so, at the time of the fathers, Jerusalem was not known, nobody knew what that is, okay, it was Elekapitalina, it was abandoned by Jews, and it was, and for 2000 years, nobody knew anything about it, it was just, like, very provincial, very local city, town, almost like a village, but they've said, at some point, it will be capital of the world, okay, because they saw this revelation, prophecy, and they were very spiritual themselves, and they could foresee what is going to happen, and, brothers and sisters, what's happening now in the Middle East, this is related to that, and no matter how much time will it take from what is going on now, with hitting Iraq and other Muslims, and becoming the leader of the, having the greatest army in the whole Middle East, okay, now Israel is still a very local player, okay, but, but, it seems that, at this end of times, we will have the whole world centered there, the, all the power, all the finance, all the culture, all the, so, this is why there is also this Achaemenid movement of saying, all religions come, Jerusalem, you're Muslim, welcome, you are Jewish, welcome, Christian, it's so, it's going to be peace for all, all religions, and it will become one religion, and everybody will receive this religion, and it will be the religion of Antichrist, brothers and sisters, so, we are moving there, okay, and it doesn't really matter if we will reach it in our lifetime or not, but it's all going there, and we all participate in this process, and it matters, everything each and every one of us does now will have importance in, in light of those events, okay, so, our choices, coming back to our choices, okay, we see that it's Sodom and Egypt, what does it mean? Okay, Sodom, of course, is the symbol of the all kinds of moral, and, and chastity, okay, let's put it that way, all kinds of sin, kind of, kinds of perversion, okay, all kinds of this lawlessness, okay, all that filth, okay, it will be promoted, and it is already, okay, promoted, but eventually, it will be promoted from Jews, and, of course, people will think that it's nice, okay, that there's nothing bad about it, okay, it will take different shapes and forms, okay, we cannot really know how exactly, how ugly it will look, but apparently, it will be convincing to all that this is truth, and light, and virtue, and etc., okay, and also, Sodom is a symbol of darkness and silence, okay, there is no word of God truly heard there, word of truth, people will be talking about God morning to night, but there will be no true word about God, and it will be darkness, even though it will seem as the light for the whole world, but it will be darkness, it will be spiritual darkness, because there is no God there, okay, no true God, it's all Paul, it's all Antichrist, it's all, okay, against God, but people, well, look, think now, people now think Jerusalem, oh, it's the center, there's so many churches there, you go to pilgrimages, they will use that, they will use that and say, yes, yes, yes, yes, so unless you have that seal coming from God, you will not tell the difference, you will not see the fakeness of it, and Sodom and Egypt, okay, what is Egypt? Egypt is this civilization which enslaved the people of God for few hundred years, okay, and not, okay, there is, there is not much worry about the other people, we see the revelation is written with respect to what is happening with the church and people of God or with Christians who are calling themselves Christians, so many of them will be enslaved by Egypt and the whole world also, okay, but it's not the main thing, so this Egypt is enslaving and it is going to be centered there and it's going to be through what? 666, okay, through money, through finance, through finance, that's why there is this restriction not to buy and sell, okay, and that's how he will be managing the whole world, it's not going to be that harsh like Nero or Stalin, okay, just kill you, yes, people also will be killed if they don't, but he will try to have soft way of managing everyone, economic, you don't want my system, well, just die of hunger, okay, you don't, you won't have property, you won't have house, you'll just die of hunger, okay, it's your choice, yes, you have rights, we don't kill you, we don't do anything, but you die yourself, okay, so this is how it's going to be done, and already, brothers and sisters, we are being enslaved by that, okay, if we have a lot of properties, we have some, I don't know, financial, okay, we rely on, I don't know, our pension plans, our, I don't know, medical insurance and other, you know, stuff that is related so much to finance, if we cannot do without it, we will be in his system, we will eventually be under his rule, but the main goal now is not to have financial freedom, the main goal now is to get, to gain the seal of God, that we are sealed and we can be sure to stand against all these things, and I remind you that to preserve the seal every day, okay, you have to have this effort, this love, okay, if you love your wife only on Wednesdays, sorry, you don't love her, okay, so if you love her all the time, but on Wednesday, you went and you fornicate with someone else, sorry, you don't love your wife, so the same thing happens here, if you love God always, but now, okay, I take a break, okay, sorry, you don't love God, and we ourselves always like to take these breaks, okay, and to find excuses to serve my mom a little bit, so this is not going to work, brothers and sisters, okay, it's either yes or no, okay, it's either you have this love or you don't, you receive the seal or you don't, so now is the time to prepare for all of those things, sisters, okay, because they are unfolding, okay, they are taking place now, and this war is spiritual, and we need to feel these attempts of these evil spirits and evil people driven by that spirit to enslave us, pull us into their world, and we want to stay in the world of the kingdom of God, this is our world, okay, we belong to it, we don't want to give it for anything else, this devil was successful to take out some members of the church to his king, that they care more about world, about politics, about financial well-being and other stuff, he was successful in doing that, but his success must stop on us, okay, we must not let him have our hearts and souls and bodies, may the Lord give us the strength, may he awaken us, strengthen our will, and kindle our hearts with this fire of his love and with prayer, aiming at him, at his kingdom, craving for it all the time, and willing to also be his witnesses of his love, of his truth to this world, Amen. God bless brothers and sisters.
