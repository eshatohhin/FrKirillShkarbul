Dear brothers and sisters, it is quite difficult to discover where the true Christianity is. But after we have discovered that the true faith, true Christianity is in the Orthodox Church, we run into another difficulty, that we have different models of Orthodox life. Many different people tell us about Orthodoxy and it seems to be quite different. 

Today I want to say first about this difference in ways of being Orthodox. And also how is this related to this greater crisis that the Church is now going through and how not to slip into this lack of living faith, which unfortunately has grasped many Orthodox. Now I'm not talking about the nominal Orthodox who consider themselves Orthodox but they don't care, they don't go to church.

I'm talking about the people who are in the Church. Because even the people who are in the give us this first impression about what it is to be a true Orthodox Christian in the 21st century. Very often we see that it is very different from what we read in the Gospel and in the Holy Fathers. 

Well, the Gospel by itself doesn't fully explain to an average person what it means to be an Orthodox, to be a true Christian. Even though all the answers are in there, but there are so many different ways of understanding the Gospel. So we look into the lives of the saints, into the writings of the Holy Fathers and then we discover that many of the people who are Orthodox, even the priests, they don't live according to what is taught by these Holy Fathers. 

Today I want to tell you about this problem and about this difference in approach and in this model that is presented by the people who consider themselves Orthodox or who are pastors, spiritual leaders, monks. Well, first of all, diversity is a good thing. We see even in the approaches taken by different apostles. 

Even though they were one in the core, in this core message of the Gospel, and they had councils together, and Apostle Paul sought recognition from other apostles, from Peter, from James, to verify that his sermon, that his testimony is in line with the authentic message. But other than that, we see that there were different approaches. And we should not take it as just the same thing. 

We have quite a special approach of the Apostle John, then Apostle Peter, Apostle Paul, and the other apostles also. So, in the early Church, there were quite a few, you can call it trends or spiritual traditions, etc. Of course, we have this Judeo-Christian, in that sense, not in modern sense, in that sense, tradition of the Palestine Church. 

Again, we have other traditions which are based on synagogue, you know, people who came out of synagogue, these former Jews. We have places which are predominantly pagan by their origin. We have different types of Christians in the early Church, and they would understand differently the significance of some rituals. 

They would have different understanding about traditions of celebrating feasts, and even Pascha was celebrated in different times. And there are other things. Some were more apocalyptic style, some were... Okay, we see even within these churches that Apostle Paul was taking care of, even there, there were peculiarities of every single church that he is writing his epistles to.

Okay, so today, when we see that one pastor is saying this, another pastor is saying that, we have some tradition in monasteries in Russia, some in Mount Athos, some in the United States by different elders, okay, Elder Ephraim, okay, and others, we see that there are quite a few different traditions. Okay, so today I want to introduce a few of those, and I want to tell you a little bit about the origin of this trend of the, I would call it orthodoxy without eagerness, okay, this lukewarm orthodoxy, okay, this orthodoxy which is stable and easygoing, okay, light version, okay. So, this light version, unfortunately, is quite big, okay, and it has its origin, at least in Russia, from the synodal period that it was from Peter the Great all the way until the revolution, the communist revolution, so that's 200 years, okay, when we had no patriarch and many problems within the church, okay. 

And one of these problems became that basically you could not distinguish secular and divine, okay, church, Christian, okay, it was all one. And this is why most of the life that took place in the parish just meant that you participate in some rituals, that you keep away from major sins, that you know some basic catechism, you partake of communion at least once a year, or maybe four to five times a year maximum, okay, and just be there, just be stable, okay, don't ask for too much, okay, just keep going that way, okay. And, of course, this is not true Christianity, okay, this is better than nothing, but it's not what the gospel is teaching us, this is not what we read in the Holy Fathers, and the saints of the 19th century they've indicated that, okay, Saint Ignatius, and Saint Theophanes, the Recluse, and many others, okay. 

And this type of spirituality lasted through the Soviet times and also to the modern times, okay, post-Soviet church. And because this is some modus of existence which can last for as long as you want, okay, you can bear with that, okay, some people cannot take even that because you need to fast, you need to do this, you need to do that, okay, it's also, it has quite a few requirements that you have to comply by, but it can be bared, okay, you can go on, okay, with this. The problem is that in the Soviet times, post-Soviet times, the society is no longer Christian, okay, in the previous years most people, at least in the rural places, they were truly Christians, okay, they were maybe not so eager, but they lived according to Christian moral values, okay, they had the worldview of a Christian person, okay, but they did not have this zeal, this eagerness of this first apostolic age, and of course, this was drifting away from the true Christianity, from the authentic Christian spirituality, okay, and it was preserved by a few, okay, let's put it that way. 

So, eventually those few became the new martyrs, okay, they were martyred by the Bolsheviks, okay. So, after those days, we have this society which became secular, atheist, and now after this, this consumerist, agnostic, and pagan society, you can say that. So, you cannot really be both here and there, so people who try to adapt that kind of spirituality, they are now facing this dilemma, okay, if I am like everyone else, it doesn't really fit, okay, my participation in church life, okay, and if I participate in church life, it's not really fitting that I need to go out and I'm just part of this big world, okay, there is some gap there, a big gap, but people live with that, okay, nowadays they can manage to put this together, okay. 

But after the perestroika, of course, in the late 80s, when the church was all of a sudden given this freedom to do whatever you want, okay, there is no longer this iron curtain between the church and society, okay, you can do whatever you want. So, there was this discovery of faith, there was also this vacuum of ideology in the society, because this collapsed, all this Soviet stuff collapsed, and many people, they could not live with that ideology, it was not like now, like people now can just live to eat, drink, and have fun, okay, no, Soviet society was more ideological than what we have now in Russia and everywhere, okay, so people could not just, okay, just live to, you know, enjoy your life, okay, most people, some could, but not everyone. So, there were quite a few people who were seeking for the true faith, okay, some chose sects, some chose Krishna, some chose something else, Buddha, but some chose the true Christianity, the Orthodox Christianity, they became Orthodox, okay, and for them Orthodoxy was everything, and they were seeking for the roots in the Gospel and in the Holy Fathers, and then when they were meeting the people from this Soviet time, faithful, they saw that it's quite different, okay, that, of course, I'm not saying everybody was like that, now I'm generalizing here, but quite many people, the general trend from those Soviet times was that, okay, just keep going, just don't rush, okay, be part of the world, and at the same time go to church, maybe receive communion once a month or once in a year, and they saw it's something else, okay, these new people, these new people who were converts, new converts, for whom it became everything, okay, now the whole purpose of their life was Christ, was the Gospel, okay, and because they did not find many leaders, spiritual leaders, who could give them that at that time, then because of that they were treading on this, okay, ground, new ground, okay, so not everyone was successful, okay, and that's why we have all kinds of stuff going on in the 90s, okay, in the 90s we had people become crazy about, say, Antichrist, some people, other people became crazy about something else, okay, modernism in the church, some people became ultra-patriotism or something else, okay, they thought that's true Christianity, and in those days, of course, there were people who found true Christianity, true faith, and they had this, their peculiar approach to faith, and this is why we have now little different, not little, quite a few different ways of presenting this faith which is alive, and as a matter of fact, in other churches, other Orthodox churches, we have 15 of them, right, and in other Orthodox churches we have a similar problem, the majority of people, I'm not talking about nominal ones, I'm talking about people in the church, they sort of found a way of this lukewarm Christianity, okay, they are just, okay, keep going, okay, don't rush too fast, okay, just be there, just do some minimal things, and you are, okay, drifting towards salvation, okay, eventually you'll be there at some point, okay, which is, of course, is not, okay, leave everything away and follow me, okay, or, okay, don't go bury your father, bury your father, because you follow me, okay, Christ said, okay, let those mortals bury their mortals, let dead men, and, or, okay, don't care about where to live, what to eat, what to drink, just seek the kingdom of God, be, so that it's above everything, not many people like that, okay, not many people like that in any of these churches, so now I'm talking about the faith which is alive, which is bringing fruit, and which is true Christianity, or it's close to it, okay, and we have such people, now I'm talking about the situation in the Russian church, which is quite big and important, significant, and I can tell you that they were rather different, okay, there is father Daniel, who was martyred in 2009, and who was, had a great zeal of doing this testimony in front of Muslims, and atheists, and sectarians, and was very successful at that, okay, he had his shortcomings too, but overall we can be sure that he was doing the right thing, he had his true zeal for Christ, okay, there was quite different tradition of father Alexander Mann, okay, who was emphasizing this one-on-one relationship with Christ, and very personal, individual faith, and gave this discovery of this new world, of this new belongingness that people found when they discovered Christ for themselves, and that was also very influential, and many were drifted, were inspired by that, and until now there are people who are in that trend.

Unfortunately, it also had its shortcomings, because some people, they went too far, they became ecumenists, and modernists, etc., etc., okay, so we always need to be careful, and there are, there were other trends, okay, and there were trends which are less successful, and which are more successful, okay, there was this big trend to get ready for the apocalypse, okay, quite eschatological, that saw all this threat coming from digitalization, from these barcodes, and stuff like that, and of course some people went astray, okay, they went into paranoia, and, you know, burning their passports, etc., okay, but so there is a lack, so when people see that majority of priests and faithful, like average parish, are not really up to the gospel, okay, many Orthodox don't really read the Bible, etc., and so there is something wrong here. Some of them, they went into schisms, okay, some went into Protestantism, okay, some went somewhere else, somewhere else, some became cynical and agnostics, and I can tell you that very often people, they were experiencing crisis because they did not get fast results, okay, and they got burnt out, and they became cynical, and they maybe slept into some sins, so this first zeal, it was, they just burned away, so this is what, like this, this traditional, let's say, traditional is in a bad sense, okay, Orthodox would say, well, we told you it never fits, okay, they want to climb to the heavens right away, but then they fall, and they are burnt out, okay, but we can keep going, okay, of course, this is not the solution, okay, this is not the solution, the solution is to find a way of being always in Christ, always eager, and we have everything for that, okay, just don't expect everybody to be like this, all the pastors of the Church to be like that, but we do have such priests, we do have people who put effort into spiritual life, who find, who find out what is hesychasm, who find the way of testimony and spiritual growth, and who educate themselves always about faith, and are seeking the kingdom of God continuously, ongoing, there are such people among the priests and among laity, quite many, okay, so we should not be discouraged, okay, when we see, okay, this picture of many Orthodox who participate in liturgy, but they don't know anything about it, okay, this very passive participation is just like observation, we just stand there and look what's going on, okay, so certainly we should not be discouraged by that, we should know very well that the true Church is still out there, okay, the true Christianity is out there, it is in the Orthodox Church, it is in the Orthodox faith, we can find all the answers, all the solutions, all the means of avoiding delusion, which is unavoidable in the heretic setting, we can find all of that within the true, holy, apostolic Church, and we would be able to withstand all challenges, and the biggest challenge is actually coming from this crisis within the Church, it's not coming from outside, because when you are not eager in your faith, it becomes like a glass, it becomes like this pot, okay, from clay that you just crush, okay, so when many Orthodox, many faithful become... this is why all these heresies, they've collapsed, okay, Catholic Church collapsed, it collapsed a big time at the Vatican II Council, okay, it's just rubble, after Vatican II, Catholic Church is just a rubble, okay, it used to be like a big monolith, but now it's just a bunch of gay people who are completely controlled by the spirit of this world, okay, and in different ways, it's just rubble now, okay, and the same with the Protestants, okay, they are eager today, tomorrow they are burnt out, and they're gone, okay, or they are eager about some fake stuff, okay, fake music, fake worship, fake theology, they could be as eager as you want, okay, in those fields, but at the end of the day, all of that collapses, they are traveling around churches, shopping around, finding what they like, and it's always a failure when you are basing your spiritual choice based on your carnal flesh and your blind mind, so it is only in the Orthodox Church that you can still find a way out, and you can still avoid all those delusions, mistakes, but when we have many people, many Orthodox, not so eager, the whole church, big structure, becomes rigid, okay, and it can be broken, okay, in case that happens, which would be a big blow, okay, to the church, we should not get into despair, we should know that the Church of Christ will manage through, okay, even though maybe we have some collapse, we have some schisms, we have some fight, we have some fake bishops, heretic patriarchs, etc., we should not be discouraged, okay, we should not be discouraged, because with the Lord's help, He will preserve His saints, He will keep His people, it is a matter of each and every one of us growing in our faith, and bringing more and more testimony of our faith, sharing with people, because this world is suffering, it's suffering big time, because of all those delusions and sins, passions, which are swaying people away from Christ, from God, from anything good and divine, may we be preserved by our Lord from all this evil, from all these threats that are surrounding us, okay, may we be ready spiritually for anything which is coming, okay, any disaster, okay, any calamity that will be falling upon the Holy Church, and upon the whole world, as a matter of fact, but for us, the most important is that we are in Christ, that we are not trying to find a way to be friends with this world, okay, we are ready for this radicality of the gospel, okay, we want to live by the gospel, and not by, okay, some standard easygoing light version of Christianity, which is at the end of the day is going to fail, okay, may the Lord help us, give us His blessing, and keep us in His truth, I mean, God bless.
