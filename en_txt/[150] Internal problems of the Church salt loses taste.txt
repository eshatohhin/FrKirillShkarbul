 Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!
 We are now in the celebration of Holy Pascha, Lord's resurrection, but this celebration
 is somewhat darkened by what's happening in the world, in the Orthodox countries, in the
 Church itself.
 And I would rather, of course, talk about some high spiritual matters, Divine Liturgy,
 glorifying God, high meaning of the Gospel, Holy Fathers, but we need to talk about the
 problems that we are facing.
 If we don't fix them, if we don't work about fixing them, talking about higher other spiritual
 matters doesn't really make sense.
 So this is why today's topic is about something that we need to think deeply, because often
 we think that problems come from outside, from enemies of the Church, from some political
 forces, from the devil, etc. but most of the problems come from us, from the spiritual
 situation of the Church as a whole, and of every Christian, everyone who is a member
 of the Church.
 So people don't like to talk about it, and this is why nobody liked prophets, because
 they were saying words which were not pleasant and criticizing.
 Remember Ahaz, that 400 prophets, fake prophets, they were telling him nice pleasant things,
 but there was only one, Mika, who was saying things unpleasant, and then they called him
 and said you will die, and the army will be defeated, and that's what happened.
 So when something comes from the Lord, it's unpleasant, and people don't like talking
 about it, thinking about it.
 We like to come to Church and it's all pleasing and specifying, everything will be fine, everything
 will be good, peace and happiness and joy, and God's blessing be with you.
 And we like these words, and peacefully we go back home, everything is so nice.
 There are other people, on the other extreme, who are telling you Antichrist is here, everything
 is so bad, and everywhere it's 666, and it's also demons everywhere, they are coming, some
 fear, some paranoia, Orthodox paranoia.
 The Church is called not to do either of those things, the Church is called to awaken people,
 to bring them to vigilance, and to motivate them to begin spiritual fight, to face the
 reality as it is, and to live spiritual life, to discover what does it mean not to be earthly,
 not to be fleshly, serving your flesh, serving your interests, selfishness, what we call
 old self, but serving the Lord, serving Christ.
 So today we see Orthodox countries in a war, we see Church splitting and having all kinds
 of problems within the Church, of course we can blame other people, some other countries,
 corporations, Mesa, anywhere, but the problem is not that, the problem is us ourselves.
 As soon as we lose the immunity, the spiritual health, demons also come, and all those enemies
 of the Church, they also come, and only then the Lord allows them to succeed, and to bring
 chaos within the Church, and suffering wars and else, and other things to the Orthodox
 people, countries.
 Let's focus on the spiritual, what we can say about the state we are in, and the problems
 are both on the individual lay people level, and on the Church level, and why I want also
 to talk about this, because very often we come to the Church with some expectation,
 some rosy picture, oh it's going to be like heaven, no, the Church on Earth is not like
 heaven, it's going to be like in the army, and army sometimes losing, and some soldiers
 maybe not fit or drunk, or even sabotage their own army, it's a war, it's a war, spiritual
 warfare is going on, and you'll see a lot of ugly things in this war.
 We can see that nobody is praying, nobody wants to pray.
 Come to Church, also in Orthodox countries, not many people come to Church, we have regular
 service on the Divine Liturgy, Sunday Liturgy, maybe 1-2% of the population, when 70-80-90%
 they consider themselves Orthodox, so they are Orthodox, but they feel that no need to
 go to Church, maybe once a year, twice a year, but that's not following Christ, that means
 that the Holy Communion don't care, confession, don't care, we live our daily life, we enjoy,
 we buy things, we travel, we have our purchases, we have this, we have that, and ok, yes, faith,
 yes, I believe, yes, but it doesn't influence your life, you don't change your values, you
 don't change the way, and then the Lord comes and He hits you with a war or with something
 else, with a sickness, and then people run to the Church to pray, only to get "I want
 this giving", the Lord gives and then they are gone again, that's not following Christ,
 we cannot expect to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, which is hard to get, it's not that
 easy to get there, so even when we go to Church, ok, from people who go to Church, also many
 live in sins, in big passions, it's not ok, we need to be honest to ourselves, and also
 even if there is no big sin, we also can see that the prayer, divine service for us often
 becomes like therapy, we listen to some music, like meditation, we listen to some music,
 we have some peaceful feeling, and we go home, sorry, but this is not prayer, prayer is dialogue
 with God, prayer is you are involved, you know what's happening, you will bring the
 sacrifice within the Liturgy, participate in the supper of the Lord, ok, so few of us
 have this participation, people don't read about their faith, they don't know anything
 about their faith, partly because they don't want to, lazy, busy, with something else,
 family matters, so when, when do I learn, when do I don't read, ok, I read all kinds
 of things, Facebook for many hours, no problem, but faith, spiritual fathers, I'm not talking
 about the spiritual, reading spiritual fathers, holy fathers, theology, some serious Church
 literature, just the basic, basic catechism, most people, they never read, never opened,
 and they consider themselves as authors, and also it's not about lay people lazy, we
 can see if we have 80% people baptized, but only 1% goes to the Church, where is the rest,
 why they don't count, because they are baptized automatically, just come, ok, baptized, baptized,
 there is no meaning in that, it's not the magic, it's not something that you're baptized,
 all of a sudden you become a great saint, no, if you don't know, if you don't understand
 that this New Covenant, that you are now in Christ, with Christ, you need to live in this
 Covenant, you have to have your old self die, you don't see this, you don't know anything
 about this, you don't even know these things exist, of course you won't go to Church, you
 won't need it, you will just keep living as you live, so this is a big problem, a structural
 problem within the Church, not everywhere, there are some parishes, here we have at least
 6 months of preparation, very often it's a year, more than a year, 2-3 years sometimes,
 someone is willing to become Orthodox, he needs to enter into this Covenant, have a
 full understanding of what it's all about, and also of course nobody has, even those
 people who come, they don't have spiritual guide, spiritual father, or anyone they can
 ask real spiritual advice, everybody is so autonomous, everybody knows everything, same
 with priests, priests don't have spiritual supervision, that's a really very strange
 situation, and that brings people to get far and far away, because our passions are still
 there, the deceit of this world is still there, our selfishness, proudness is still there,
 and the evil spirits are still there, who are dragging you away, and me, they are trying
 to drag us away from following Christ, from this path to salvation, and then we lose,
 and we don't understand what's happening, why does this happen, why the Lord is sending
 some hits, hitting us on the hands, sicknesses, this and that, he's trying to bring us, pull
 us back into the spiritual life, we see even the clergy, the church, when gained freedom
 in those post-communist countries, the main task was not spiritual revival, the main task
 was to build, build more churches, build, build everywhere, and then building, after
 building, put more golden things inside, make it more beautiful, make it more nice, but
 that's like a bubble, okay, it's an external thing, or some people, they like photographs,
 also church event, oh, nice photographs here and there, and oh, it's so beautiful, nice,
 put it into Instagram, Facebook, yes, you see, so nice, this is nothing, this is nothing,
 all the Lord, all these external things is nothing, it's like smoke, just vanishes, so
 you just hit it with something, and it's gonna break right away, because there is no foundation,
 the true foundation is Jesus Christ and spiritual life, if a monastery is not found, it's not
 living by prayer and spiritual life, just has some, I don't know, construction, I don't
 know, publishing, these, these, these, mainly external activities, okay, it has to have
 these spiritual basis, then whatever happens, whatever war, revolution, whatever, the church
 will stand, it's gonna withstand all of that, the Lord told us, you are the salt of this
 world, if the salt becomes unsolved, there is no use, people will just throw it away,
 and people will just trample it with their feet, and there is no use, we become the salt
 that's unsolved, we need to feel this responsibility and this dignity that the Lord is giving to
 every single one of us, not just clergy or bishops, every faithful, all the prophets
 in the Old Testament, they were not priests, mostly, almost all of them, they were simple
 people, so this is why don't expect all priests and the church, the official, it has to come
 from there, no, it has to come from each and every one of us, we need to begin with ourselves,
 we need to live spiritual life, and see how can we contribute to improving the spiritual
 life of the, of the whole church, as a whole, we are very passive, we don't want to move,
 we don't want to serve others, to some ministry in the church, okay, some involvement in the
 social life, some social work, of course this is not the main thing, but it's also important
 in the church, we want to sit and just enjoy and just have our own life, and this becomes,
 the whole church becomes like this, so we are losing, this is why we are losing, and
 the Lord is looking at this, so this is not the church that I want to have, okay, so maybe
 just might as well get rid of it, okay, have some, I don't know, Napoleon, Hitler, just
 come and just erase everything, so let us, let us change, let us, let us think very deeply,
 we need to recall Saint Ignatie Prenchininov, he's a great father of the 18th century, and
 he was predicting all the catastrophes of the 20th century, all the Servolutions, wars,
 this big hit on the church, he saw that many decades before all that happened, and he saw
 this great problem within the church, and that was at the time when building many churches
 and many books published, and everything is so nice, and so people say you're crazy,
 you see everything is going well, what are you talking about?
 But he was like that Mika, Mika, the prophet, nobody wants to, wanted to hear him, he was
 marginalized, his books, he had difficulty, often refused, and he saw that the spirit
 of Antichrist, it's not only outside the church, everybody who serves the old man, he has this
 spirit of Antichrist in him, but even people within the church, he said, there's many of
 them serve Antichrist, so this is why we don't need to have this rosy picture, that the church
 is paradise, but at the same time he said that the Lord will preserve his church throughout
 all these troubles, and Saint Serhim of Sarov, when he was asked similar question, he said,
 don't you remember what the Lord told to prophet Isaiah when he said that I am the only one
 and they're willing to kill me, the only one who is worshipping the true God, and the Lord
 told him, I have kept for myself seven thousand sons of Israel who have not bowed their knee
 in front of Baal, seven thousand out of maybe three million, okay, very small percentage,
 but seven thousand, and now it's much more, we have much more.
 So even in these hard difficult times when we see within the church so many problems,
 we need to know that the Lord is keeping his people who have chosen him and the truth,
 and we need to be among those people, and we need to do the work of the Lord more actively
 to work more decisively on changing ourselves, on contributing to this fight against evil
 everywhere, on every level, with antichrist, may the Lord help us, may the Lord grant us
 this gift to be the salt of the world, to live according to this calling so that we
 can inherit the kingdom of heaven, we can in this time of darkness, in this time of
 apostasy, we can keep all the commandments of the Lord and be his witnesses, even to
 the end of the world, okay, you will be my witnesses, we need to be witnesses of his
 love, of his grace, his salvation, may the Lord help us, give us his blessing and give
 us his joy of resurrection, I mean, Christ is risen, indeed his risen.
