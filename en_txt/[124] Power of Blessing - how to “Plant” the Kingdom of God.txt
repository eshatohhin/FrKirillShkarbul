 Dear brothers and sisters, the new year is approaching and we will be wishing each other
 a lot of blessings and we will be asking the Lord to bless the new year that is coming.
 But what does it mean to bless and how come we can bless God?
 He can bless us, we bless him.
 In the seminary we had a discussion when the priest is blessing someone, he blesses you.
 Is this just some form of greeting, like hello, it's just some information, I meet you, or
 it has some mystical power that's behind this.
 Well, this is quite a stupid question, because we know that there is some special power behind
 it, even though some people don't believe it.
 But to see what is this power and how come not only priests, but anyone, the lay people,
 anyone, we bless food, we bless our children, we can do all kinds of blessings, how we can
 do this.
 And why Christ is called the blessed one.
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
 And blessed is the kingdom of David that is coming.
 And also the Lord is telling us in Matthew 5.44, he is telling us, I tell you, love your
 enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those
 who persecute you or treat you badly.
 So, do these things to those who hate you, to those who curse you, you need to bless
 them.
 What does it mean to bless them?
 You say, Oh, blessed are you.
 Just some words.
 What does it mean?
 Well, to understand this better and to have a better appreciation, what you do when you
 are wishing someone something good, any kind of wish, I wish you graduation in university,
 I wish you Merry Christmas, I wish you something else.
 When we wish something, what does it mean?
 Theologically, what really happens when we do that?
 When we have that feeling and appreciation of what it is, we will think twice what to
 say and what to wish to others, we will have great joy when we do it.
 So blessings also can be expressed through thanking God.
 We're thankful to God, Eucharist, the service, the divine literacy that we're doing is this
 concentration, this is the ultimate blessing of God and God blessing us through giving
 us He Himself, and we are united with Him in this Eucharist.
 We can see it from the Greek word Evelogeo, and we will look both Greek and Hebrew because
 they give us different clues about what is behind this word, this word Evelogeo in Greek
 means "say good things", Evelogeo, Logos, word, speech, say, so it is in the service,
 in the worship that we do, it's basically through all these praises, blessings, extolations
 towards God, we are saying something good about Him, we are expressing our attitude
 towards Him, and in return He is blessing us, He is approving us, He is giving us His
 joy, His power, His light, His life as a response to our attitude towards Him.
 In real life, daily life, we are unhappy with people, with weather, with this, with that,
 this means that we don't really have that thankfulness, thankful heart towards God,
 and this is why we have all these problems, all this unhappiness that we have, problems
 we have anyways, but very good example of what does it mean to have real heart that
 is thanking God, is this parable of Lazarus and the rich man.
 Lazarus was all in some wounds, he was all in blood, these dogs coming, licking him,
 he doesn't have any food, he is a beggar, he is just lying there, hungry all the time,
 all this very miserable life, but the Lord calls him Lazarus, which is in Hebrew Elazar,
 Elazar is El Azar, El Azar means God have helped, this is strange, what kind of help,
 he is lying there, he is all in those sore wounds, maybe leprosy, we don't know, some
 sickness of his skin, it is always blood leaking out, and what help, where does God help him.
 But another one, the rich man, he is celebrating every day, and he doesn't need to thank God
 for praying, so Lazarus, we can see from this name, this gives us the clue, that his heart
 is thankful to God for letting him go through all these sufferings, for helping him endure
 and overcome all this pain that he has to experience, he has this heart, he is thankful
 to the Lord, despite all those things, and when he dies, the angels immediately take
 him to the bosom of Abraham, his soul is like that, this is the model for us, to treat God,
 no matter how bad things are today, we are thankful to him so much that the Lord is helping
 us go through it, and we are with this joy, we have this patience, and we go through all
 of this, this is the heart that is blessing God all the time, continuous, this is what
 it is, because it is spiritual blessed, spiritual health that the soul gains through blessed,
 because only with this union, this interchange of blessing with God, that we can be saved,
 and we can be with God, and I've explained about the divine liturgy, how this happens,
 this ultimate union, we gain it in the divine liturgy, and the Brahma, the Hebrew words,
 the Hebrew noun is Braha, the blessing, the blessed, blessed is him who comes in the name
 of the Lord, paruch haba, the shame of the night, paruch, the Jewish last name, paruch,
 paruch is the blessed one, and what does it mean, this word in Hebrew, the basic translation
 that you'll find in most dictionaries will tell you that it's either to bestow power,
 power for success, prosperity, fertility to someone, or it is to declare that somebody
 has this power, we bless somebody who already has it, and we're acknowledging this, and
 it is also to wish someone these good things, any good things, this means to bless, and
 when we bless God, that means that we acknowledge that he is the source of all these good things,
 power of success, prosperity, fertility, any goodies, he is the source, so this is the
 basic meaning of blessed in Hebrew, however, there is a deeper meaning, this deeper meaning
 is related to plenty, and this brings us to this vaccination topic, because to bless is
 like planting someone unto the kingdom of heaven, to receive this juice, this life from
 the kingdom of heaven, to be planted on, like a tree, okay, the branch is cut out, it's
 put in the ground, it's planted in the ground, and it grows, it becomes another tree, or
 there is a branch from some, like apostle Paul is also using this understanding, he
 says that you are from the wild sycamore tree, you are taken from that tree and planted to
 the good tree, and now you are receiving this good tree, but those other branches that used
 to be on it, they were cut out, okay, so this notion, and this means that any kind of blessing,
 it has to do with this relationship, with this establishing, this window through which
 we are tied to the kingdom of heaven, and we will pray that may your kingdom come, your
 will be done, your kingdom come means all the kingdom of God, come here, be planted,
 everybody, me, you, everyone, our families, be planted, be grounded to this kingdom of
 heaven as much as possible, and this will give us eternal life and salvation and freedom,
 so when we say some wish, what does it mean, in Hebrew, it's not, we don't say may God
 bless you, it just says God blesses you, it's not God, it's you, right, but we have some
 deep relationship, and because we are created in his image, we are able to accomplish something
 that God is accomplishing, it's actually God is blessing, but it's us saying, we say God
 bless you, and this moment the God really blesses, so it's not just words, it's not
 just expressing my attitude, I wish you good health, I wish you something else, no, it
 is actually some power that we transfer and we share with others that will be grounding
 them to the kingdom of heaven and to that source of blessing that is coming from God
 himself, but the question comes is, everybody's blessing is the same, if myself, I am far
 away from God, and we all are quite far away, but when we sin, we turn away from him, we
 turn even further, we reject him, and when we reject him, how can we make someone united,
 so if we ourselves are facing other direction, not facing God, not craving, not wishing to
 be with him, well, how can you wish someone be with him, okay, it's impossible, so when
 we are in sin, when we have all kinds of garbage in our heart, when we are proud, when
 we are attached to this world, this fallen earthly world, we are not really able to,
 even if we say something, it will not have much power, so it is important for us to come
 closer and closer to God, to ourselves, crave for this blessing, and to share this blessing
 as much as possible with everyone, including our enemies, and people whom we don't have
 good relationships with, okay, that will make us similar to God, in our heart, in our mind,
 in our attitude, and this will really bless and influence other people, and this will
 be spreading throughout this world, as this, now they are trying to use this vaccine to
 spread, to have this immunity, we want to spread the gospel, to let the world have this
 immunity against evil, as many people as possible, to be close to God, to be blessed by him,
 so this is what we do, this is what we do, and this is what we wish in this New Year's
 time also, and we wish for the New Year to be attached to God as much as possible, to
 carry this blessing, otherwise it will be really tough, it will be really tough, so
 let us wish each other all kinds of blessings, and myself, I want to express, and I don't,
 it's not I won't, I'm saying that the Lord blesses everyone, gives you great joy in this
 upcoming year, great success in every good deed that you have, any good intention that
 your heart may have, may it fill your hearts with light, unite your families, give strength
 and blessing to everyone in your family, give your wisdom and guidance, strengthen your
 faith, your commitment to him, your love towards him, may this New Year bring great light success
 to your hearts, to your lives, that you may come closer to him, bring rich foods of faith,
 and enjoy his sonship, his divine mercy, unobstructed, unaltered, away from all kinds of error, selfishness,
 mistake, and destruction.
 May the Lord keep you away, keep you free from all evil that is in this world, chase
 it away, and destroy enemy under your feet.
 Amen.
 God bless.
