 to your brothers and sisters the Lord he said that you need to be vigilant not to
 enter into temptation and to pray to be awake this spiritual awakeness is
 directly related to prayer and apostle Paul tells us to pray continuously to
 pray in spirit and the Lord said that those who pray who worship the Lord in
 truth and spirit they are the true worshipers only prayer can make us the
 true warriors of Christ able to withstand all the evil and would be
 following him would be growing in Christ day by day however there are many false
 fake ways of prayer some prayer makes you proud okay it comes out of proudness
 oh Lord we glorify you because this and that some prayers are full of pragmatism
 give me this give me that like trade I did this so give me that okay this is a
 pagan prayer some prayers are becoming mantras that people just repeat
 continuously hey sometimes we pray we read the prayer very often but we pray
 we pray in front of emptiness okay to some somewhere there okay and we don't
 even have any feeling of the Lord's presence that he is hearing us okay so
 we just read a book those prayers are empty they don't have faith and the Lord
 himself he said that in in that day many will come and tell me Lord Lord we have
 done miracles in in in thy name and have chased our demons and so not so what and
 so forth but he will say I don't know you the doers of evil so it's not enough
 just to pray just to say something to the Lord and unfortunately very often we
 are not willing to talk about this we are ashamed to tell others how to pray
 to teach our children how to pray even in the seminaries where future priests
 are educated being being educated there is not enough emphasis on the prayer
 nobody would ask him how do you pray do you know how to pray okay it will be
 sort of well everybody should know how to pray but nobody does almost nobody
 okay at least in the seminaries there is this practice of participation in divine
 services and common prayers okay before meals in morning before and the night
 but all of these also become very formal very often somebody would read to do do
 do do do do do do okay everybody is just standing there okay so there is a lot of
 formalism and and even the priests who are supposed to be pastors and who are
 supposed to teach others they they find themselves in very difficult situations
 when they are far away in some parish in some village and here encounter
 temptations okay okay life is hard maybe family problems maybe financial problems
 loneliness all kinds of temptations and without strong spiritual foundation they
 they will be broken okay and then the whole community will disappear okay
 scattered so both the clergy and the faithful we all need to know what it
 takes how to pray what what is the prayer that that would reach the Lord okay and
 to help us in this way there is a great there is a great legacy there is a great
 tradition of hesychasm in the Orthodox Church hesychasts are those who saw
 that there is a worldliness in the church and they've dedicated all their
 life to prayer solely prayer and spiritual exercise called esketism and
 all of that was inherent to every Christian okay in the early church
 everybody would be hesychasts okay everybody would have a strong and focused prayer but
 later many became nominal and formal Christians and we know that in the
 second coming of the Lord he said when the Son of Man will come will he find
 faith on earth that means that true faith those hearts which will be alive
 alive in their communication with the Lord will be so few that almost none you
 won't you you'll find it okay it's gonna be hard to find so let us put this
 as a as a goal as a basic fundamental spiritual goal of our life I need to
 adjust my prayer life this doesn't cancel everything else okay it doesn't
 cancel all other aspects of my spiritual life including first and foremost the
 Holy Eucharist communion okay receiving the body of Christ with the
 repentance okay with divine liturgy with Sunday attendance in the divine
 liturgy this is fundamental this doesn't cancel my other practices reading the
 gospel morning and evening prayers
 Commandments living according to the commandments of the Lord okay deeds of
 mercy okay all of the all of those will become actually they will become one
 integrated prayer even including my work my social life my family life okay my
 studies everything will become one comprehensive prayer as a sacrifice to
 the Lord if I have the right prayer life okay and we need to think deeply what
 is this prayer life and some people would tell me that Hesychasm is a
 monastic tradition it's for those hermits who go into desert and they just
 pray there all day and they don't need to worry about other things and I would
 tell you no Hesychasm means nothing more than calming down your passions your
 emotions your fantasies and talking to the Lord receiving the peace of the Lord
 coming into our heart and with this peace talking to our Lord because
 otherwise this will not be communication this will be just okay some voice which
 has no strength no power so just information data okay and the Lord
 doesn't need any data from us okay he needs our heart and this is why why it's
 also called the prayer of the heart but it's not this fantastic Catholic this
 burning heart okay this is just emotions and stirring up your carnal carnal self
 which has nothing to do with spirituality actually it's a demonic
 demonic burning which just destroys okay someone makes you a psycho so there are
 many risks okay and this is why some people say that you cannot do it unless
 you're a monk or you have a strong supervisor who would guide you through
 this process well even if we don't have someone who can supervise us okay
 someone experienced in the Lord's pray in the Jesus prayer we can still do
 some minimal by minimum I mean a 100 Jesus prayers okay you could use the
 prayer rope any prayer rope even a necklace anything would work and just
 repeat a hundred times Lord Jesus Christ son of God have mercy on me a sinner
 well the problem is that you would tell me well I'm now praying morning prayers
 evening prayers I go to church why do I need Jesus prayer well I can share with
 you my experience my experience was that I discovered that I'm always losing my
 focus during the prayer and I didn't pay so much attention to this before I tried
 Jesus prayer because it makes it much more evident to you that you are far
 away from talking to the Lord because in the Jesus prayer is a very short prayer
 which is focused on your calling on your message to Christ on your petition to
 Christ to have mercy on you okay to pardon all your sins okay this has the
 deep repentance built into it because we acknowledge that we are sinners that
 we're nothing but at the same time we call him our Lord and we we call upon
 his name and we ask him for forgiveness and for mercy and even if for such a
 easy such a okay such a short message we cannot keep our attention we cannot
 focus and we think about everything else this this means that we have
 something really we are in big trouble okay our mind in Greek it's called news
 okay our soul if you will our deeper me is fundamentally damaged it's ruined
 it's incapable of even the most simple dialogue with the Lord just cannot do it
 okay this is because of all the corruption all the all the sins that I
 have done because all of the because I live only in flesh I'm focused on
 external things and nothing else there is no there is no spirituality in me
 okay I'm not driven by the spirit I don't leave according to the spirit I'm
 fooling myself you need to discover this and you need to need to you need to see
 that this is the in the core this is the core of all your problems in life
 internal external this is the that we are drowning we need to understand we
 are drowning and this is why we need the Savior and only Jesus Christ is the only
 true Savior and it's not something we just acknowledged oh yes yes okay no
 this is something that unless we we receive his saving salvific help and
 power we are drowning we're losing our life so the Jesus Prayer will help you
 discover this problem and this will become a great motivation for you to
 try to practice the Jesus Prayer to discover the power of hesychasm and it's
 not some method some methodology just do this one two three and you get result
 it's not yoga okay the result comes from the Lord we just need to put effort into
 this and we don't expect any special outcome okay I will be stronger I will
 feel peace I will do have something received from the Lord we don't expect
 anything because it will be given by the Lord and not produced by my effort so
 whatever he decides to give me is up to him and I don't have any expectations my
 focus is only on the repentance and on the attention okay that I don't run away
 so every time you will discover that from 100 times that you read maybe 90
 times will be off the track okay you will be something you'll be thinking
 about something else you'll be thinking about your job your your dog you gave
 your I don't know news or something else it will be okay some distracting factors
 some other people okay we will have some mood and something else some memories
 everything will be distracting us pulling us away and we need to pull
 ourselves back okay to become a whole to become one me who is driven by
 the Spirit who is driven who is self-controlling I have the goal of
 talking to the Lord and I am talking to the Lord okay and this will help you in
 everything else okay it will help you in your other prayers it will help you in
 participation in divine service it will help you in reading the Holy Scripture
 in doing the deeds of mercy it will help you in your work in your studies in your
 relationships with others again and you will see that you will truly become
 warrior of Christ but the main aim is salvation it's not something else it's
 not just to become more efficient the task is salvation in Christ to to live
 with him every moment to be awake to be alive spiritually again to have his
 salvation in us all the time okay if you if you find it doable to read the Lord
 the Jesus prayer 100 times every morning the next step I would advise to add
 another hundred sometime during the day okay and I would stay I would stick with
 this for at least couple years okay don't rush for more goals okay if you
 don't live in a monastery we live in this world this will will be great if
 you can make it stable and also during the day sometimes now and then when you
 wait for someone or when you shower or when you do something else just say it
 one or two times or even shorter Lord have mercy Lord have mercy on me
 sinner Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ save me
 some even shorter ways of saying this this prayer okay and you will feel that
 your heart is always in this prayer mood okay no matter what you do no matter
 what you what happens okay this will this will make you a child of the Lord
 if you can make this part of your life this will improve your spiritual life
 tremendously may the Lord help you may he gave you the courage the motivation
 the will to proceed to become his child to become his warrior to gain his wisdom
 to gain the peace that we need so much coming from above and staying in our
 heart may the Lord's blessing be with you as we approach the great land I mean
