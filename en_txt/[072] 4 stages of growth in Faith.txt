 Dear brothers and sisters today we will talk about faith and faith is not a belief okay it's not faith
 in Jesus Christ that means belief in Jesus Christ and we are saved by faith but this means something
 else it doesn't mean just accepting the idea or the concept that yes Jesus is savior and he is God
 no this is not enough this is a very basic and minimal thing and in Judea there were
 100 percent the Jews were believing in God okay and they went to the church they prayed they had
 whole scriptures but they had no faith and Jesus told said that how long will I endure you this
 faithless and corrupt sinful generation adulterous generation and the disciples
 okay they could not chase away one demon okay from a young boy young young guy and they asked
 why we could not do that and the Lord told them because of your lack of faith you don't have faith
 okay they believed and they even followed Christ and they even confessed him as Messiah
 but that was not enough and in the gospel of Luke they asked him Lord increase faith in us
 what does it mean what does it mean increase faith in us so today we will talk about faith as
 a power as a power that makes us do three things okay three basic things it's action
 decisions actions mean I decide something and I do it second is knowledge contemplation
 knowing the truth okay power to grasp this truth and the third is the toil the labor that we
 exert on the long term to achieve some goal goals okay and all of this that is on our part
 brings about change in the external world and everywhere okay so but we we need to see how
 this power can be applied to us how does it change our life and there are different stages okay once
 we become Christians we decide to follow Christ we will go through three basic stages hopefully
 okay and maybe some people even reach the fourth stage okay so on each stage it will be a matter
 of our faith that is there or it's not there okay so let us let us talk about the first stage
 okay the first stage is basically related to decision and this turn that we do okay
 okay first we meet the truth okay and we make this decision to follow Christ okay we decide
 right now right on the spot we make this decision and we decide to follow this and needs faith to to
 to be able to do such and make a such a decision okay and this also means to decide to change your
 life okay I make a decision I change my life okay this is one time event and it requires our will
 our judgment our acknowledgement of truth okay okay we entrust ourselves to the Lord and most
 importantly this can be possible if we decide to repent if we acknowledge that we are sinners and
 that we need to change our life okay so repentance decision to repent okay 30 years and it's it's
 big decision you you are a sinner you are dying you need to understand this okay and then we
 decide that we follow Christ and because only him can save us only he can save us okay he is able
 to do that and that means that he is the savior okay so we make this decision we this becomes
 clear for us and then we decide because of this new direction we decide to sacrifice ourselves to
 him and whatever we have including our way of life including our property sometimes okay remember
 that christians in the beginning they just sacrificed everything they sold everything
 and they brought it to the feet of the apostles because their decision was very strong okay okay
 but this is one time thing basically it's one time thing it doesn't last that long okay and on this
 stage okay when the person has made this decision okay and decision can be a different degree okay
 some people have lack lacking faith they say oh yes yes he is savior but i don't want to change
 too much okay uh this decision is very weak okay uh because one thing uh how to test is a prayer
 okay if you decide to follow him you will talk to him you will be willing to talk to him
 okay and if people become christian but they don't want to pray this is this is a problem okay
 they don't decide i i need to pray okay this this is a problem this means that there is something
 missing there okay so we the person begins to pray okay and on this first stage okay this
 first stage the uh the lord is giving us um okay a credit okay he is giving us grace and power
 and we feel that he is with us and during first maybe couple years maybe up to five years usually
 the person is like flying okay he has this this feeling that he is with grace he's with the lord
 he the lord is helping him okay and uh this but this is credit okay the we should not think that
 this is because i am now close to god or i have some virtues no we don't have everything anything
 yet okay so the we we have the true direction the real direction but but in terms of virtuous life
 or being okay uh good christians no we are not yet okay but we have this experience on the end
 later the lord is uh walking uh stepping aside okay and saying okay now you go yourself you do
 it yourself okay and we enter into the second stage of our christian life okay of course this
 is general way it's much more complicated in real life but overall now we're speaking about general
 structure okay so this second step a second stage we don't feel any more this help and we feel that
 okay it's as though we're lacking where lord is gone this grace is gone and my sins are all back
 my passions are all back and many people become uh again okay they have evil thoughts they have
 issues against god okay they they don't trust him anymore sometimes they don't trust the church they
 stop going to church uh some people uh okay leave the church even okay and at this period also some
 struggles come okay some painful experience okay and this all is a test that the lord wants us to
 go through okay the second stage is very difficult to go through okay and um and the lord is waiting
 there he is not far okay maybe we think he's far no he is not far he's um not far and he's watching
 how we go through this stage okay so what is some characteristics of this stage okay in terms of
 faith because here on this stage the way the faith works this power of faith works is different okay
 basically the way it works is that we push ourselves we break our old self okay
 it's we are not willing to go to church but we push ourselves and we go there
 we are not willing to pray but we push ourselves we are not willing to change we have these desires
 and that but we push ourselves we push ourselves to repent and to change okay we are exerting this
 force this power and trying to get through this um this this period okay so this uh period is uh
 needs a lot of toil there's a spiritual toil when fasting is difficult many things are becoming real
 difficult okay to love others is difficult okay we we don't like them and we don't have enough
 patience okay and sometimes we do something because we ought to do it okay we we because
 not because we love god so much but we we need we know we need to do it we ought to do it okay
 and we do it and sacrifice we are not willing to sacrifice to help others to sacrifice our time
 our money okay we we don't but we push ourselves and we do it okay and this power that we exert
 is the power of faith okay and also learning about faith okay this period is uh when we
 study okay a lot of study we read bible okay we push ourselves to read the theology lives of saints
 okay and we uh after a long effort okay this period may take years many years okay we slowly
 get into the third stage maybe with some up and downs okay sometimes it's not that smooth okay
 but eventually we need to get to the second to the third stage okay and the third stage that we
 get into is basically we have the joy is awaking we begin to feel joy in us following christ
 okay for example we begin to feel joy when we sacrifice something not because of rain glory
 but because we like to sacrifice our time our energy for to other people for for the lord's sake
 we are enjoying ministry some kind of ministry even if it's very uh simple maybe it's just
 swiping the floors in the church but we enjoy we feel that we are with the lord okay we're
 doing something for the lord uh we have willingness to go to church on the long term okay long term
 not because we're excited like in the beginning we're excited and we go no like on the long term
 we feel yes we want to go there because this is where we meet with the church with all the
 christians together okay now we have uh another attitude we change our attitudes
 naturally it's changing our attitude to others okay we have more love compassion to others we
 pray we begin to pray for them we really feel that this is good okay to pray for them we have
 humbleness we feel that we are worse than anyone else that people are better than us okay um also
 we have slowly we have assuredness that the lord will not abandon me okay in uh tomorrow day after
 i rely on him okay uh he will help me i'm uh i'm entrusting myself to him okay uh he says don't
 worry about tomorrow okay we know that tomorrow he will take care we're not becoming lazy and do
 nothing okay we are still working hard but we don't have any fear or any depression about the
 economic problems or some uh okay lack of support or some uh disadvantages life uh situations stuff
 like that we know that it's all going by the plan and we the lord will take care of us no matter
 what happens even the war nuclear war anyone anything happens he will be with us and that's
 most important okay and the last thing is we lose this attachment to material things we don't really
 okay we lose everything tomorrow it's just burned or stolen destroyed we don't okay it's even easier
 for us okay now i'm all that is gone fine just glory to god okay so we don't have that attachment
 this also is a sign that we are entering into this third long lasting long term uh
 okay condition not as in the beginning it was like beginning so this third long term condition
 of christian heart okay which is broken uh from this uh for in glory and other passions
 okay we are entering into it okay and uh basically we have um already we're able to conquer big
 passions okay we had some sins in the on the third on this second stage sometimes it took us
 many many uh confessions okay to overcome some uh disease okay some same desire that we have
 we were doing it again and again and okay uh but at some point we overcome okay this is when
 the faith comes in that means that all our efforts are not in vain we got into the next stage okay
 we're getting better okay so you know this is uh happening on the long term okay so and some people
 few okay not many they will get into the fourth stage okay because sometimes people ask why in
 the early church people were able to do miracles and they were speaking different languages to do
 the pre-ministry they were healing they just touch someone and he's healed and they could
 prophesize about future why we don't have this now why we're we we don't have it god has changed or
 something uh no nothing has changed basically okay god is same as he was and his power is
 as as great as it always was and will be okay uh we changed we have changed we are weak we are
 selfish we are proud and we have all kinds of problems okay lazy so uh but the path is the same
 okay today i'm describing this path that we need to go through with the power of faith working
 us all the way through to that stage okay and the third the fourth stage okay some uh science that
 someone is getting into that fourth stage and i'm telling you it's not me it's not okay it's
 not people whom you know most likely it's not you okay some people get into that stage okay
 that stage is has uh i won't talk too much about it for example people pray and in right away there
 is a result okay they pray for someone's health and it's coming there okay because their heart
 is so much close to god it's very honest and has no passion it's it's directly flowing to god okay
 and the god is has no reason not to grant okay and the person is asking for right things okay it's not
 asking for wrong things from god so the god god gives right away okay this is one of science
 another sign is um contemplation of truth okay these spiritual eyes are opening and the person
 is able to grasp some things about the truth that he could not get any in any other way okay
 by studying by reading by listening to someone okay but he's getting this knowledge about some
 spiritual realities so okay these are two signs okay i won't talk about others okay but we
 basically going in this way and this is this is power of faith the words that if you have faith
 you will move mountains this is moving mountains you pray and things happen okay we need to get to
 that stage okay we need to aim aim at that stage uh but it's not of course not that easy not that
 fast but we need to put this goal in front of us okay may the lord help us help us on this path
 give us this dariness to improve to get better to have this motivation to endure
 all the hardships okay on the third stage also the hardship the sorrows the attitude is different okay
 we we enjoy that okay there is some hardships that i need to go through to suffer because it makes me
 closer to god he suffered himself okay our attitude to any sorrows passions is also changing okay so
 let us let us uh know that the path is out there okay and we can get to that point but we just need
 to put more effort and trust god that he will help us on this path i mean may lord bless you and
 give you this strong faith increase the faith in us oh lord god bless
