 Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm in Kaohsiung in the southern Taiwan, we just had a divine service here last night
 and I'm staying here for another couple of days to see some faithful to talk to them
 and today I decided to record a video about the topic which I began last time
 because it needs some clarification, this tension between reasoning and faith and spirituality
 because there is a lot of criticism, as I said, people say "you don't use your mind, you are fanatics"
 "you are against science", etc. Well, let us first look at the gospel
 we always need to keep in mind that human reasoning, human mind is a gift of the Lord
 every ability that we have is given to us by the Lord
 but we need to understand what are the implications of relying on our own mind
 instead of being united with the Lord, following His will and His revelation
 why is there this conflict between sometimes human logic and faith?
 You remember the apostle Peter, he walked on the waters, the Lord allowed him
 He said "if you want to come, come" so he began walking on the waters
 then he looked down and he saw that it is an ocean, it is deep, these waves of water
 and his mind told him that it is impossible, how come?
 He began to drown and then the Lord pulled his hand and saved him and told him "why have you doubted?"
 the word doubt is to distinguish, "dia krino" in Greek, why did you make this distinction?
 this is possible, this is impossible, we will come back to this word
 lack of faith is related to this doubting distinction
 then in Mark 11.22-25 we also read that if you have faith and you say to this mountain
 to come from here to there and you don't doubt in your heart, it will happen
 it is the same verb, you would not distinguish in your heart
 then we see in other places the Lord is telling the people that they will be taken to the trial
 don't think what to say or how to defend yourself
 the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say
 here again we see that the Lord tells them not to think
 don't think, just go and the Holy Spirit will tell you, you will know what to say
 and also in 1 Corinthians 11.29 we read that you would need to take the Holy Communion without doubting
 without distinguishing
 well, having said all this, let's look at Romans 8.5-7
 Romans 8.5-7 I'm retelling using my words
 because all those who live according to the flesh, they think about what belongs to flesh
 and those who live according to the Spirit, they think about what belongs to the Spirit
 because thinking, the thoughts belonging to flesh is death
 and thoughts belonging to spirit is life and peace
 because the thoughts belonging to the flesh is enmity towards God
 because it doesn't subject itself to the law of God
 and it cannot do that, it is unable to do that
 so to live according to the flesh, Romans 8.12
 so there are two ways of existence
 the way of existence according to flesh and the way of existence according to the Spirit
 and whoever is guided by the Spirit, those who are guided by the flesh, they cannot judge him
 because he is guided by the Spirit, but he can judge everything
 again this judging comes here
 well, to better understand all this, the Holy Fathers, they tell us about news
 and this idea of news, which is usually translated as mind, needs some clarification
 if we want to understand the ascetic tradition and the prayer of heart, hesikas
 we really need to know how to read the Holy Fathers
 because they will deeply tell us how it works
 and the idea of news, which comes from Greek philosophy
 well, different philosophers had different ideas of news
 we will not go into it, this ancient Greek philosophy
 it has a wealth of stuff on news and very different ideas
 so we don't want to make it difficult, complicated and too theological
 basically news is a human being, an image of God, is able to communicate with God
 this is the spiritual self in the human
 God is spiritual, he is spirit, and this physical world is another realm
 but in Christianity there is no separation between the two
 and the man is created in the image of God, so the man is spiritual, but he is also carnal
 he is also in this flesh, we have this physical body, we live with these physical objects
 and other realities, relationships in this world, earthly stuff
 so now there is this issue, how is the spiritual lives in this earthly world
 so the Holy Fathers, Saint John the Damacy
 he is telling us that there is this idea of reasoning
 or generally speaking, thinking, the rational ability, or intellect if you will
 this intellect would encompass different abilities
 judging, willing, discerning, intuition, empirical knowledge, feelings
 many different things, they would all be part of this intellect
 let us use this understanding, different ideas what is intellect
 let us just have intellect as everything that is happening in your heart, in your mind
 your rational thinking, feeling, ability, perception, conscience, everything goes in there
 and what also belongs to this intellect is noose
 and noose is sometimes called spiritual eye, it is a spiritual eye of the human soul
 and this spiritual eye of the human soul would be either alive, open, or it would be closed
 so the noose, let us say it is mind, but mind not in our sense
 just mind, your brain, it is this ability to contemplate the divine
 to believe, to have this faith relationship with the Lord
 and to have this spiritual understanding of things
 what is the will of God, what are the absolute values
 these things, they are perceived by noose, by mind
 and noose becomes a guide of everything else
 if you have this communication with the Lord, your noose is alive, you are spiritual
 then you can have the right judgement, you will have the right feelings, you will be rectified, everything will be subject to the spirit
 you will be guided by spirit or noose, some fathers would even use it as synonyms
 spirit and noose, but let us not do that
 so you will have this, but if you don't have, if you are a noose, everybody has noose
 no matter if you are a sinner or not, you are a carnal or not, you have noose
 but if we are driven by the flesh, if we are guided by the flesh, our noose will be enslaved
 we will not be able to make use of it
 so coming back to the healthy state, if you are spiritual, if you have noose
 you recovered your noose, it's healthy, it's communicating with the Lord
 then you will need this noose, you will need to face the reality
 and you will have the Holy Fathers call it logos
 logos, let's call it reasoning, or it can be called narrow intellect
 there is this all encompassing intellect that just has everything in it
 and there is this, we can call it practical intellect, let's call it practical intellect
 this practical intellect will tell you what to do in the specific different situations
 so it will be very practical
 and then you will also have this ability to discern different things, different concepts, different ideas
 that you meet in this world, that you see in this world
 so this also will require your practical, well, this is not practical intellect
 there is another term for it, the anoia, the thinking ability, or discerning ability
 so it's sometimes used together with this practical intellect
 let's not make it too complicated
 basically there is this noose that is responsible for looking at the spiritual
 communicating with the Lord, receiving revelation and truth from the Lord
 and there is this other intellect that helps you on a daily basis
 that helps you to do what's according to the Lord's will
 and it will help you deal with things in this world and understand many things in this world
 so when the noose is enslaved and we are driven by the flesh
 we still have this lower, this practical intellect, if you will
 or this discerning ability, if you will
 it will not be cancelled, but because it doesn't have the noose guiding it
 it will be guiding itself, and while it's guiding itself, it will be in enmity, hostility towards God
 and it will be, it might have some correct decisions in terms of how to benefit yourself
 how to deal with things in this world, you might be very smart
 but it will be against the Lord, it will be enmity towards the Lord
 so this means that people can be very smart, very geniuses, do science, do whatever
 but would not be in touch with the Lord
 and their thinking, their philosophies, all the stuff that they are busy with
 will be against the Lord, and will have nothing in common with the Lord's will
 so this is why people who are very learned, people who are philosophers or scientists
 very often they are the most stubborn and not willing to believe
 not willing to live with the Lord and become spiritual
 because they have great proudness and selfishness, self-centeredness
 that's coming from their very developed fallen intellect, if you will
 this practical intellect, this thinking ability, rational thought, you can name it any way you like
 so this is the explanation, this is the reason
 and we need to be very careful, we need to be very careful when we study something
 especially if it's some philosophy, does it have anything to do with the truth of the Lord?
 is it helping me to understand better the will of God?
 if it doesn't, I would treat it in that way, maybe it's just a tool
 it's not some wisdom, wisdom is related to NUS, to the spiritual mind, if you will, to the spirit
 so having said all of this, there is this issue of recovering our NUS
 we recover our NUS not through reading a lot of different books and stuff
 we recover our NUS through spiritual life, through repentance
 through reading the Holy Scripture and the Holy Fathers
 gaining the same wavelength that they had in life, similar view, values
 we try to learn from them and not just to learn, but to recover this spiritual ability
 to become alive in God, in Christ, to allow him to govern us, to guide us
 this is especially a great task now for the Great Land, which is upcoming
 because it is us living according to the will of God, which will be decisive in the Last Judgement
 this week we are recalling the Last Judgement
 and not only by living with the Lord, by doing his will
 by having compassion, mercy towards others
 by being wholeheartedly dedicated to ministering him
 to learning him, to receiving the wisdom from him
 we want to be the Maria, Maria also needs Marta
 but the greatest goal is to be Maria and the Lord will tell you how to be Marta also
 to use what you receive from the Lord in the practical sense
 may the Lord help you, give you wisdom, give you joy of sacrificing all the carnal stuff for the sake of union with him
 which is life and peace, we want to have life and peace
 and we don't want to have death, which comes from flesh
 may the Lord give you blessing, strength and joy in the upcoming land. Amen
