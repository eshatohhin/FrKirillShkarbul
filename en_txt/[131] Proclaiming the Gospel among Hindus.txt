 - Dear brothers and sisters, we are now in Jaffna. This is the largest Hindu temple in all Sri Lanka.
 And it has this sound coming all the time. Despite its Hindu place, we will do mission here.
 There are families, Orthodox, already. And we made a decision to send a preacher here.
 Missionary will be coming every Saturday. And he will do mission here,
 hopefully converting all these people to Orthodox Christian faith.
 There are several buildings here. This is the religious center of Hinduism on Sri Lanka.
 Please pray for the mission. And may the Lord Jesus Christ be with us. Amen. Good place.
