 dear brothers and sisters we still celebrate Epiphany and during these times we think deeply
 about the heavens opening and us being invited into the kingdom of heaven and this opens the
 end times okay all the prophecies have been fulfilled and now everyone is invited and
 the devil is conquered and there is nothing that is really obstructing the testimony of the gospel
 and the lord is waiting for the for everyone to enter into this bridal chamber
 to participate in this celebration with everyone who is called and who comes
 and who is worthy of this celebration and two weeks ago I recorded a video about seven
 churches of apocalypse and of course I give just one one of understandings of this of the meaning
 which which gives us some clues about where we are and where we're going what's the mission of
 the church now when are the final end times and what are we what should be we be ready for
 well during the past two weeks I gave some more thought into the question of the very last times
 okay the coming of antichrist and whether we should be getting ready for that right now with
 all the political changes that's that are going on in the world and especially I have some new
 thoughts after my mission trips to China because in China we see the devil is trying to prevent
 the work of the mission okay because the orthodox church is illegal it's illegal to do any mission
 in China and this gives us a very nice reminder about the evil that came out with those
 satanists Bolsheviks okay in Russia who've killed so many Christians that maybe more than ever we
 had rivers of blood and it's much more than any holocaust or anything like that and until now we
 are reaping these outcomes of these satanists okay both in China and in North Korea and even in
 Russia and Ukraine for that matter and in the whole world okay so it's not a it's not a it's
 not a joke okay it's not a some some history that's passed the devil is until now trying to
 block to prevent the mission and he's trying to destroy the church harm the church as much as he
 can okay through the wars through his laws through restrictions through many different ways and in
 this so-called free world through feminism okay if you look around I don't know where you live but
 if you look around everybody is concerned just about where to buy this how to
 okay make life more comfortable house more beautiful where to buy food okay sales
 enjoyment this and that it's all about hedonism and okay serving belly okay as satan is portrayed
 moving on his belly and that warm of of the hell okay why warm well the warm is eating
 ground and it's moving upon the ground and in the ground okay this is the most miserable imagery
 for people okay who become only concerned with this material dust with with this stuff of this
 world and and they go to hell as a result but the invitation is still open and the the war the lord
 is inviting everyone into his kingdom and when we read apocalypse we see and also when we read
 carefully the words of the lord himself in in the gospels when he is speaking about the end times
 his prophecies we can see that there are two periods okay I'll dedicate maybe a special video
 for that but these two periods one is the period of wars and rumors of wars and all kinds of
 disasters and during and that period is not yet the end okay but when after this there will be
 the end okay the end is also a period of time it's not just finished okay like the moment no it's a
 it's a period of time it's quite short but it's also called the great flips okay the great sorrow
 okay protestants translated as a great disaster okay or great persecution but the original flips
 is means sorrow it's a great sorrow and during this sorrow it's not just that countries will be
 fighting with each other but even people within one family will be killing each other and most
 importantly the church will be persecuted more than ever okay and basically a whole humanity
 will be and will be enslaved by antichrist okay and this will in okay will halt the work of the
 mission okay and and the people will not repent despite some natural disasters that will be going
 on in order that they may repent and turn to their god they will get even more angry and they will be
 saying blasphemies and in this decisiveness to to be in this evil they will be receiving those marks
 of the beast and they won't be able to repent okay it's quite amazing how you can make the whole
 world unable to repent okay so that that of course for the for the saints for the true christians who
 are still believing during those days that will be the greatest sorrow okay and for the lord himself
 it will be a great sorrow so this is why it's called the great sorrow and even though we have
 already quite a lot of experience like that it's not yet that time okay we can say that we are
 still in that previous period that is not yet the end and why i'm saying that is that because
 the mission is still going on okay and the end will come when the gospel will will be preached
 to the whole universe and that means that everyone on earth will have a chance to to receive the true
 gospel to become orthodox christian okay and whoever will make this the right choice and will
 respond to that invitation will do that and there will be no one else okay there will be no extra
 opportunity for the mission okay and then that's when the end will come brothers and sisters so we
 can say that our mission efforts and the fruits of the mission they are directly related to the
 coming of antichrist and that he will not come as long as the mission is bringing fruit and this
 gives us great encouragement to do this mission and grant consolation that is in our hands and
 it's not we're not such just some passive observers okay and everything is just going
 okay downfall into the hell no and i can share with you my experience and my feelings
 as a missionary that even though most people they don't want christ they they are full with
 something else with some heresy or with mammonism hedonism or with some other crazy stuff like yoga
 or some other form of occultism uh kabbalah uh gave satanism astrology and all that
 nonsense yet after shoveling a great amount of
 of grass we are still finding the jewels or the
 diamonds if you will okay this these these diamonds are still coming okay and we have
 people who used to be satanists and they're coming and they're repenting and becoming very pious
 orthodox christians we have one professor american who was protestant for 30 years
 and then he found that it's false and he was catholic for another 30 years and then he found
 that that's also flawed but finally he found orthodox christianity and he became orthodox
 in his 60s and and we have we are finding people in china okay in that communist propaganda state
 where people massively are following this or that or have this all kinds of cults and
 most people are just obsessed about material things material pleasures but still there
 we are finding despite all the prohibitions all these uh you know attempts of the devil to
 halter the mission still the lord is sending souls to his church and they become modern day
 saints okay i'm not afraid to say that because i see how eager they are i see how how close they
 are to the lord how serious they are about spiritual life and that gives me a great
 encouragement to continue the mission so brothers and sisters it's really
 the mission that the lord is giving to us and he is hoping that we are active in this
 and you can think about it okay the the lord created this world in order that
 this can happen that people can be united with him okay receiving christ in their hearts and
 being invited to heaven's joining with him receiving the grace and the wisdom of the of the
 lord and as as long as there are at least some new people coming this world will exist there is a
 great meaning for this world to exist and and it's also up to us to make that happen okay it's not
 just we are passively observing okay we have to be very active it's in our hands to um to kick out
 this antichrist to push him further away into future okay to and so we are not afraid of all
 those i don't know digital control currency brainwashing all those things for us this is
 nothing okay as long as we are faithful to the lord we don't we don't worry about okay the whole
 world is slipping into those that slavery okay if if the world chooses to do that okay it's the
 world's choice but us we will be faithful to our lord and we will be bringing the fruits that the
 lord is waiting for first and foremost spiritual fruits okay and mission mission wise the prayer
 has to fulfill everything in our life we should be living by the prayer it will bring us peace
 in the world it will bring us great strength and courage in testimony in prayer again in life in
 every in every in every uh sense because the lord himself will be with us may the lord's joy be with
 you during these days may you feel this invitation this openness of the heavens and may we be loyal
 steadfast in truth and not be deceived by any fake teaching any fake authorities
 and be parts of the living body of christ he is holy catholic and apostolic church
 brothers and sisters the only church and not sleeping into this fake ecumenical
 spiritual adultery that is now so common in in the world in many denominations
 may the lord be with us and may his blessing and joy and truth be with all of us i mean
 Merry Epiphany brothers and sisters!
