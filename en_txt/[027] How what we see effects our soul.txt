 Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about a very important topic is how our eyes
 and what we see can influence our internal world, our heart, health of our soul. So this
 topic we will begin from the words of Christ. In the Gospel of Matthew 6.22 he said that
 the lamp of the body is an eye and if your eye is clean or simple or pure the whole body
 will be light and if your eye is wicked or sick then the whole body will be darkness.
 What does this mean? The first literal meaning has to be established and the literal meaning
 is related to the vision theory that it was predominant in Israel at that time and the
 understanding was that eyes they are like a lamp or like a torch which make it possible
 for you to see the objects around you like a torch in the darkness you can use it to
 see objects in the same way the jewish they thought that the lamp the eyes are like the
 lamp shining and making it is possible for you to see everything well that was thinking
 at the time which is different now but we should not be concerned about this that much
 having understood this we need to see what was the real meaning that Christ is putting
 into these words because here he is not telling us about these theories okay it was common
 sense at that time he is using these wording to convey another message and this message
 has two levels okay today we will talk about the first basic level and we will begin talking
 about the second level which is even more important the first level is the physical
 vision okay what we see well what we see now we think that okay i saw something and then
 this i got the information then i switched to something else and i'm getting new information
 actually it doesn't work like that what we see is living inside us okay this is like
 music okay sometimes we hear music somewhere and then it's playing over and over in our
 mind okay in the same way what we see is sort of entering into us and it's running inside
 us okay in our heart in our subconsciousness okay and it's it's still there okay at least
 for some time and this can bring us to sickness okay because a lot of stuff okay we know
 that what we see is harmful okay it's it's or it's garbage it's dirty okay we see it
 and then it's in us okay and then we're thinking why i'm so weak why i don't want to do anything
 why i have some bitterness in my heart even though it seems not to i don't have too many
 problems at the moment but still uh i'm i'm down i'm low you know uh not willing to do
 anything and we don't understand why why is it like that this is a symptom okay of this
 sickness okay and compare it to ancient people who maybe didn't see uh well maybe they were
 moving more than us okay we're sometimes sitting all day in some office or at home but they
 moved a lot but even though they moved a lot they didn't see too many things okay it was
 almost all the same trees and okay now modern day people we see a lot of stuff okay on tv
 on the our smartphone in the computer movies and many other things okay we're getting so
 much information into ourselves that maybe 100 times more than people in the ancient
 times but we are we are saying okay human beings like like they were so because of grasping
 embracing so much stuff into us okay this sickness may be much worse than they had okay
 and maybe that's why there were more composers and poets and at that time but now not that
 many okay um and this might be one of the reasons okay that we are more sick overall
 okay uh than they were because of that so this means that we need to protect ourselves
 okay we need to be on guard of our own vision okay the holy fathers tell us okay be a guardian
 of what you see okay don't just okay try to see as much as you can okay that is our curiosity
 sometimes is harmful okay we try to okay i want to see that i want to see this we we
 don't have any kind of vaccine okay any kind of protection and we we have to have that
 protection okay um another and it's important that it's only christ who can really heal
 okay those sicknesses it's not that i'm just okay just uh um well have a walk and uh see
 some uh okay see some uh flowers and and it's gone sometimes it's not uh leaving us that
 fast and it's still like a virus still in there okay so let us be mindful of that and
 another important meaning that is closely related to this physical meaning is that uh
 our soul itself our heart can bring about a lot of uh a lot of thoughts a lot of ideas
 a lot of desires okay and these things they can make us also dark okay live in shadow
 okay because they block light of god inside ourselves okay and these things relate to
 internal eyes and many fathers when they talk about this passage in the gospel they are
 saying that the main meaning is actually this okay that we need to be on guard of our internal
 eye and to avoid any kind of thoughts desires temptations that bring us away from god okay
 and this is very important because what means simple eye pure eye okay simple pure eye means
 that uh uh it doesn't have any sickness or it doesn't have any any evil thing in it okay
 uh no um okay uh accusing anyone no grudges no selfishness uh no jealousy okay none of
 that okay it's it's uh it's not talking about this eye it's talking about the eye of our
 soul or mind okay in greek it's called nous sometimes so this eye has to be clean and
 open and how to see if it's really healthy and simple okay we will be getting closer
 to christ the more simple and pure our eye the spiritual eye is the more we see christ
 okay the more we are attracted to him and we want to pray to him okay the more we are
 brought to christ and if this doesn't happen then we have darkness in us and we might think
 that we have light in our everyday language very often we say i see meaning i understand
 okay it's clear to me we're using this language which is taken from physical experience clear
 or see okay to talk about our mind okay and we might think i am smart and i understand
 things and i can clearly see what you what you mean and what somebody means and we might
 think that this is the light i have some kind of light in me helping me understand things
 but uh christ is telling us that if the light which is which you think is light in you it's
 a darkness it's actually darkness how great is the darkness okay this this darkness is
 really really great really big and it's keeping you away from god okay we have to be mindful
 uh and careful about this situation when we think that i'm okay i have some kind of light
 in me okay but it's not light because it's not bringing you to christ and you remain
 evil and you remain in darkness okay so let us think about these things uh today both
 of these meanings and protect ourselves be on guard both of our carnal eyes and what
 we see okay and about the eyes of our soul may god help us in this and give us rich blessing
