 Dear brothers and sisters, one subscriber, he wrote that he subscribed because he has
 interest in mission, and some of my videos are not related to mission, especially recently.
 Well today I want to say about what mission is in our days, and whether I lost focus and
 I departed to somewhere else instead of talking about mission. We will see that many things are
 related to mission, and these things, these apocalyptic stuff, is also quite related.
 But first of all let us talk about what mission is, and what mission in today's world is.
 Because sometimes when we hear mission, oh yes, this is somebody who goes into some tribe,
 far away place, and in the jungle he is telling to those aboriginals about the gospel and about
 Jesus, and maybe we also think about the postals. Three thousand years ago they went, they were
 sent by Christ to go to all countries, and they went and they came to those savages, those wild
 people, and they told them about Christ, and they believed, and their life changed,
 they built nice churches, and prayed, and became peaceful. Well, in some way the mission today
 is exactly the same as it used to be when it all began. In some way it's exactly the same,
 because the Lord said you will be my witnesses to the end of the world, and we will talk about
 this. What does it mean to be a witness of Christ? What do we bear this testimony about?
 And this hasn't changed, it's exactly the same, but many things have changed, and
 today if we are in a post-Christian world, or we are in a nominal orthodox world that used to
 be orthodox, then our mission would not be like, okay everyone, do you know that the Lord has
 resurrected? Do you know who is your Savior? That God that He is almighty, I will now preach to you.
 Well, everybody will say, well we know all about this, okay, so we'll tell you even more than you
 know, okay, but we don't want to go to church, we also want to do yoga, we want to do this,
 we want to do that, and actually the church has these problems, so we don't believe it,
 and even the gospel, it's okay, maybe it's not true, and stuff like that. They will tell you
 all stuff, all kinds of stuff, okay, and this is why it's called post-Christian,
 okay, people they turn away from Christ and they went back to some sinful way of life, and some
 neo-paganism, okay, and or some other, okay, communism, I don't know,
 existentialism, whatever, all kind of garbage ideas, okay, but they don't want Christianity,
 okay, so how do you deal with that kind of setting, and also what do you do in the other
 countries, okay, we now have also pagan countries who've heard about Christ but don't know much
 about it, and they more or less they want to preach themselves instead of being receivers of
 Christianity, even though some countries do receive the Lord recently, in recent years, like
 Korea, even though it's Protestant, but still, and we have communist countries, Muslim countries,
 but in the 21st century the mission is different in any of those countries, it's different
 in many ways and methods than it used to be in the past, okay, but let us go step by step, okay,
 first of all we need to begin with ourselves, okay, if we don't have love towards God, if we don't have
 the kingdom of heaven, okay, we don't have any feeling of it, any experience, any
 attachment to it as citizens of this kingdom of resurrection, if we don't know what the
 resurrection is, we only heard the idea, we read the book about it, we got excited, oh it's a nice
 book, and we just preached the book, sorry, this is not mission, we need to have already some,
 we need to be standing on this path ourselves, our faith has to be grounded, well grounded
 in our life in Christ, and only after that we can begin something else, okay, so if people don't
 feel that we are people of Christ, if others around us, they see that we are jealous, that
 we are selfish, okay, that we are attached to worldly stuff, okay, they will say, well, you know
 what, this book that you're preaching, you don't live by it, okay, the gospel that you preach, so
 it's just another fairy tale, it's another nice story, utopian, but it doesn't work in real life,
 okay, so your mission is gonna fail, it's like building a sand, so the first thing for us is
 spirituality, if we don't have a well-grounded spirituality, I don't say we need to become
 saints and, you know, levitate and do miracles here and there, okay, no, but we need to change
 our character, we need to be loving, people should feel that we are positive to them,
 that we care about them, that we love them, that we don't have such a vainglory,
 okay, that we can be approached, okay, it's truth and kindness are streaming from our heart,
 okay, this is something so basic, no matter which society, which mission you have training,
 you don't have mission training, you're gonna fail, okay, I want to emphasize, because
 mission is not just for some special paid missionaries who go, okay, they get a missionary
 visa and they go to some country and those are missionaries, no, missionaries are everyone who believes
 in Jesus Christ, if we don't bear testimony about him, we're not Christians yet, okay, or we are like
 really lousy Christians, okay, we don't deserve to be called Christian, okay, we need to do some
 kind of testimony, this testimony doesn't have to be like preaching on the, you know, big
 screen and, you know, to thousands of people, no, it could be even at home, even at home people
 receive this testimony from you about the love of Jesus Christ and this makes you already
 a witness of Jesus Christ, you could be an old uneducated lady who is just washing dishes at
 home, okay, it doesn't have to be something big, okay, but through love, through kind heart, through
 prayer, she would bring this testimony about the love of Jesus Christ, okay, and now we are
 coming towards active mission, okay, I've just talked about the like internal directed at ourselves
 but, okay, now let's talk about the mission to the outer, the outreach, okay, first of all we need to
 see, we need to see what do we do testimony about, okay, you will be my witnesses, witness what,
 there are three things to remember, three main things to remember, the first is the love, okay,
 the love that Jesus had to us, okay, well this is conceptual, people will just hear about it,
 okay, we need to feel it ourselves first, okay, and when we participate in this love
 we will also have our love towards God and this love towards God is something that we do testimony
 about, that's why martyrs, they were the saints of, that were venerated the most because and all
 hostels except John were also martyrs, okay, don't forget, because they sacrificed their life for
 Jesus Christ, they were tortured and killed bearing testimony about the resurrection and
 love that they had, resurrection of Christ and the love of Jesus that was in their hearts,
 okay, so martyr doesn't mean that to just die, okay, the most important thing is not about death,
 most important thing about testimony, martyr role is to bear witness, okay, so
 witnesses, not really martyrs, okay, martyrs are witnesses, so they witness what, they witness
 Jesus love first of all and this love towards the Lord and towards people,
 towards those who are killing them, the enemies, not just the Christians, their fellow
 believers but also to even to those who are killing them and that was a very persuasive,
 very powerful testimony that is coming from God himself and not some invention or some new sect
 because this is really exceeding human abilities, to love those who torture you, who hate you,
 who want to kill you, who slander, who do the bad things to you and to your family,
 to your children but you still love them and they showed this, okay, when we see now acts of martyrs
 you will see that in those dialogues, what do they answer, how is it being done, so first thing is
 love, testimony about love, the second is testimony about truth, the true faith, okay, and this is what
 the Orthodox Church is putting emphasis on, that is the Orthodox, the true, the right faith,
 it doesn't have any additions, any alterations, okay, this is the truth and this is important
 because there is, there must be no shady area, there might be no, maybe yes, maybe no, no,
 in the Lord it's yes and amen, so we bear witness about truth, there is a risky part to it,
 that when we bear witness about truth, true faith, true spirituality, true moral teaching,
 there is a problem that some people, they don't have love and they begin to say oh this heresy,
 this is bad, you are bad, this is, and they become like legalistic, okay, and very formal, yes, this,
 yes, no, it's heresy, go to hell, okay, so this is an important part, it has to go hand in hand
 with the love and prayer and embracing the human being, the creation of the Lord, not the sins,
 not the mistakes, not the errors, okay, we should not be afraid of some false teachings
 because we have the true teaching from the Lord himself, the revelation, so there should be no
 fear, there is no fear in the Lord, in the gospel, okay, so this is the second thing, we bear witness
 about truth, and the third, and it's super important, is the almighty, the the might of God,
 the omnipotence, okay, and the glory of the Lord, and this is all summed up in resurrection, that he
 has conquered death and he rose and he gives this power of resurrection to everyone who believes in
 him, and we need to bear the witness, we bear witness both about the resurrection as a historical
 event, that this is true, this has happened, this, this message, this truth, we have trust in this,
 and we are absolutely certain that this happened, and the second, which is related, is that this
 resurrection that happened is bringing fruit in us, that is changing us, it's resurrecting our souls,
 okay, and this power of resurrection is real, okay, we've experienced this power, and we bear
 witness about this, okay, that it's not some nice stories out there, okay, so this is our witness
 about the resurrection of the Lord, so these three important things we need to bring in the mission,
 in the evangelization that we do, and no matter which setting we are, no matter in which
 country, which society we are, there are many funny examples, okay, and I didn't understand
 it in the beginning, for example, when I was in the parish, okay, I was not a priest yet,
 just a student at the time, a high school student, the priest there, he said, well,
 we need to do some mission for the youth, let us have tennis after church, and I thought,
 well, this is something really strange, I mean, what, how is this related to mission, tennis,
 okay, what is it, but later I understood, okay, that even though the young people in the parish,
 they know about Jesus, they've heard about the resurrection, but they don't live in this union
 of love that we have to have if we believe in Jesus Christ, so this may help these young people
 get together, know each other, do something together, and maybe to bring cohesion and
 love and care about each other, and also this would create opportunities for others outside
 the church who would otherwise would not come directly to the church, maybe to approach and
 to find out more about faith, okay, to see that their fellow young men and girls, they do
 something together, and hear something about the gospel and see that they are different,
 that they are more kind, that they have love, they have care about each other,
 and maybe later also to find out more about faith and resurrection, right, so it's related,
 it's indirectly related to mission, so we can say that it's kind of mission, okay, and there are
 many other examples, I don't want to make this video too long, there are quite many curious
 examples, okay, so let us, okay, this is enough for today, for this video, let us pray that the
 Lord gives us motivation, gives us courage to find out in which country how we do mission.
 The last thing about, I mentioned about this apocalyptic stuff, okay, well, the task of my
 channel is both for those who are not yet Christians, not yet orthologues, to have some
 interest, to see that the faith is not just, okay, you cannot do this, you cannot do that,
 or anyhow to break some false ideas about the church, but also
 this channel is for those who already believe in Jesus Christ but departed from the church
 or are outside of the church for some reason in some other denomination, say, okay, for them to
 strengthen on this path and to see how to come to the Lord and to get stronger. The Lord told
 Apostle Peter that when your brothers will lose their faith, you will have to strengthen them,
 you are the rock and you have to have that strong faith and you will be the strength and support
 in faith to your brothers and sisters. And I hope this channel is also could be helpful
 for people to receive this kind of encouragement and get stronger on our path to the Lord.
 And this will also help not only people, it will help the mission because if we have more motivated
 missionaries, we can do more. This is our greatest pain, greatest weakness that the church itself
 doesn't have a lot of motivated people in mission-wise, okay, people think it's not for me,
 I believe and this is good, or many people they just want to solve their problems, they have
 some sickness or they need somebody to be baptized, so they just come for this,
 okay, and they consider this is enough, they're orthodox, this is enough, but no, without active
 faith, active spiritual life and active mission, we are not really orthodox, okay,
 let us think about this, let us ask for the Lord's help, support, guidance that He can strengthen us
 on this path before it's too late, this life is very short, we can see it from what's happening
 today. May the Lord help us and give us His blessing. Amen.
