 Dear brothers and sisters, I'm on the mission in Guam right now thanks to COVID because
 all Asia is closed and we cannot visit the mission in Papua New Guinea, we cannot visit
 the mission in East Timor because of quarantine, because of lockdowns, but Guam is the only
 place that I could go this year, so this is why I decided to see if there are any mission
 opportunities here in Guam to see the situation, to find the Orthodox who are already here
 and that is the purpose why I'm here.
 Well, I think you know Guam is part of US, belongs to US, the whole archipelago of Mariana
 Islands and the biggest island is Guam, it is basically it's in Asia but it belongs to
 United States, so it's quite close to Taiwan, just about three hour flight from Taiwan and
 it's in the middle of nowhere you can say because it's like seven and a half hour flight
 from Hawaii and it's right in the middle of Oceania, just next to it is the Mariana Trench,
 the deepest trench in the world and this is a volcanic series of islands, it's more
 than 100 islands but only four of them are quite decent size and have some decent population,
 the main one is Guam, the second is Saipan, I'm hoping to go there in a couple of days
 and also islands of Rota and Tinian, those four islands, these four islands are the bigger
 ones and hope to have an opportunity to try to start mission on these four islands, to
 visit all of them during this trip.
 Well, here in Guam right now we have some Orthodox who are Russians, I met with them
 already, they are stuck here basically because some of them they wanted to go to the United
 States and they have visa issues and we hope that they have their problems solved but some
 of them most likely are going to stay here for good and if we can form a community here
 it can be a starting point to introduce Orthodoxy to others, so hopefully that there will be
 a place where everyone who lives in Guam, in Saipan, in other islands could come and
 see what is Orthodox Church, to pray, and to find out more about the authentic faith
 of the apostles.
 Well, historically speaking, the whole Pacific was developed first in the 18th century, the
 Orthodox missionaries came to Hawaii in the end of the 18th century and later Saint Innocent
 of Moscow, Veniaminov, he came to Aleutian Islands, the islands which are up north, not
 far from Alaska, going to the north part of the Pacific, there he developed a mission
 and there are churches there until now and in Hawaii also, we've got the miracle working
 icon of Ivaron for Mother of God in Hawaii, so the mission went spread to this region
 but didn't reach Guam for quite a while and I actually am not aware if there was any Orthodox
 mission done here ever, so hopefully later is better than none, so hopefully we can begin
 this mission now and we have the strategy, we have the priorities to develop it, I will
 dedicate one of my later videos, so we do a mission here and what are our goals, what
 is, if we have any success here so far, so please keep an eye on that.
 Today I want to say a few words about Guam and the local people who have lived here for
 thousands of years, they are called Chamorro, this Micronesian ethnicity, they have their
 own language, most people speak this language or at least understand, the younger generation
 in Guam can understand some of it, older generation can speak and people on the other islands
 that are less Americanized, they can speak it quite well, even small children, so there
 is a movement also to revive this language, to make it used more by everybody, there are
 some schools that teach Chamorro, the culture is quite nice, Chamorro people they are friendly,
 they are Americanized but not that much, you can still feel not just from the face, you
 can feel from the character, from the culture that it's a different nation, they have some
 values which are quite amazing, for example, mamalo, in local language, it means to be
 shy or to be humble, and we know that blessed are the meek, for theirs is the kingdom of
 heaven, they will inherit the earth, so the meek are humble, they have the value of inafa
 mawolek, inafa mawolek means to do good, to make good or to do good, which is a very important
 value that we emphasize also in the Christian faith, so they are very nice and kind people,
 there is a very important notion of respect, to respect other people, respect the nature,
 so it's quite a humble, quite peaceful culture that lived with nature for all these centuries,
 and this is good soil for the gospel, and actually Guam was under Spanish rule for about
 four hundred years, and that's why everybody became Catholic at some point, but now most
 of the population, even though they're considered Catholic, but they don't go to church and
 they lose the faith, and they got disappointed about the faith, and all kinds of sects and
 cults thrive in this place, because people are quite religious still, and I really hope
 that there will be the testimony of the true faith, the orthodox faith here as well, with
 God's help. Well, the population here on Guam alone is about a hundred seventy thousand
 people, which is twenty times more than all of the Aleutian islands, so it's quite a large
 population to become important for the mission priorities of the church, so I really hope
 that the church can send the priest here on a permanent basis, and also missionaries who
 could come and develop, both on Guam and Saipan and other islands. Well, the history of Guam
 is quite sad. After Spanish it was changing hands, it was at some point American, German,
 Japanese, eventually American again, it was a really big fight here during the World War
 II, the Battle of Guam, and there was a battle of Saipan, and a lot of people died, soldiers
 from both sides, and also a lot of locals, they were just jumping from cliffs, because
 propaganda was telling them that Americans will kill all of them. Well, there is a lot
 of sorrow, there is a lot of pain, a lot of blood was shed here, Guam in the 20th century,
 recent times, so it is a place that has its own history, a place that knows that life
 is not that easy, and these hardships very often prepare a way for Christ, for faith,
 so that people are not selfish, not arrogant, that they are seeking the truth, they care
 about eternal life, about fundamental values of life, and I am very hopeful that the mission
 will succeed, and that we will have a lot of Chamorro Orthodox here at some point, and
 not only Chamorro, a lot of other nations live here, of course a lot of Americans, soldiers,
 we have now Russians here, people from everywhere on earth who live here, they should have access,
 they should have the opportunity to come to Orthodox Church, to pray, and to witness Christ
 to others, may the Lord help us on this path, please pray for this Mariana Island, for the
 mission here, and for all the Orthodox here, thank you very much, God bless.
