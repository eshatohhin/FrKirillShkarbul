 To you, brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!
 Yesterday we had the service here in Taichung, it was the last Easter Pascal service in Taiwan,
 we had in different places, we had the Procession of the Cross in Taipei, and of course we will
 celebrate Pascha for all this bright week, and also on the 40 days, all the way until
 the Ascension.
 So we recall these days when the apostles, they were with Christ, with the resurrected
 Christ, he was meeting them, very often telling them about the Kingdom of Heaven, and it was
 like the bond, the wall between this world and the heavens was broken, because now it
 was not clear what is what, where is heavens, where is earth, because the resurrected Lord,
 he came so often and he met with them, so from now on, from back then onwards, all these
 limits were broken, and we have a very profound experience of Messiah, of the true Mashiach
 during this time, especially yesterday night on the Pascha service itself, and every Pascha
 for us should become a greater and deeper experience of this resurrection of the Lord
 of Messiah himself.
 And this is also a good indicator for our spiritual life, if there was some success
 in the Great Land, if our spiritual direction was in the right direction, our spiritual
 efforts, then we have a renewal, we have a rebirth now on Pascha, we feel it, it's subjective
 reality, it's not just "okay, it's over, we're done, we're back, now we can eat whatever
 we want" and it's just normal life, no, it becomes a new life, we are born again in Christ,
 our covenant is renewed, and we have him, if we have him live in our hearts, this is
 the greatest joy, if we have him communicate to us, this is also great joy, and it is difficult
 to share this experience with words or some descriptions with you, the experience that
 I had on the great celebration of the resurrection of the Lord, I really hope that everyone can
 have this experience, and if you didn't have it this past, I hope you can set the goal
 to have it next past, and even on the regular Sunday resurrection, celebrating the resurrection.
 The topic that I want to talk about today is some, I cannot say revelation, I'm not
 a prophet, I'm not a Holy Father or something like this, but I can say that I've experienced
 the true Messiah on the service, the power, the wisdom, the spirit of the true Messiah.
 During this service that we had yesterday night, and this experience tells me that there
 is a lot of misunderstandings about what happens now in the world, and it comes from this lack
 of communication with the true Messiah, and the false Messiah, the Antichrist, he's trying
 to mimic and to show that he is the Messiah, and even people in the church and Christians
 and clergy and even hierarchy, they might take him, his message, as the message of the
 Savior, because he also is appealing to truth, to justice, to this world, to the suffering
 in this world, we know that he will come as the Savior of the suffering, those who suffer,
 as Lenin for example, he came to save people from slavery, exploitation, from being uneducated
 to the poor, he gave them industrialization, a bright future, this, this, that, social
 justice, and people bought it and people believed him and followed him.
 But at that time Lenin is nothing, he's like a child, like a baby compared to the false
 Messiah that's working right now in this world, and I think this is important for us to think
 about because it's now influencing everyone, what's happening now in the world, and who
 are the key players, because this is our world picture, how we picture, how we explain what's
 going on, and some people will say, well, you again, you talk about politics and worldly
 stuff, well, it is also a lie from this fake Messiah that the church, the Christians, they
 need to carry only about some theological stuff, which relate only to heavens, to eternity,
 and for Christ himself he came to this world, he became human, and he established this church
 so that he can work in this world, do his mission, it's just a matter of not putting
 this world a priority, this world as the goal in it and by itself, but we have clear tasks
 in this world that we need to accomplish, and to accomplish those tasks we need to understand
 what is going on, so it's not a matter of being worldly or politicized that we need
 to talk about these things, this actually can witness our faith that we can surpass
 the limitations of this world, of this logic, while being in this world and carrying out
 some mission in this world, because blind man, he will fall, he will fall into a trap,
 so we need to be mindful and have guidance from our Messiah, from the true Messiah, to
 be able to distinguish what is fake and what is not.
 So the question is that with this big conflict that's going on now, that's dividing the whole
 world in two camps, and which can bring even the famine and other things, and now we also
 have expectations of bigger pandemics and other troublesome things, the four horsemen
 of apocalypse, it doesn't matter how you describe it, but we are facing big challenges
 in the world, the whole world is facing, so there are three ways, three positions that
 people take, one is that we support one side, another is we support another side, or we
 just distance ourselves from this and we say, as long as I can have safe peaceful life,
 I don't care about all these things, let them wage war, let them do whatever they want,
 I will just preserve my little world, I will live for my family, for my projects and so
 on.
 All these three reactions to this, they will not, they can bring us to failure, if we are
 on the other side, we might be on the wrong side, we don't really know if it's right
 or wrong, very often when there is such a division, polarization, both sides are wrong,
 and both will fail, or one will win, another will fail, but in the process it's gonna
 be a mess, but those also who are distancing themselves, they will, it will come, their
 turn will come, we see it with the war now going on, people don't want to touch anyone,
 but the bombs are flying and killing tens of thousands of people, okay, so we think
 behind this, the key players are not presidents, or governments, or even corporations, or even
 some mysterious, I don't know, commission, you know, BÃ¼lterberg, or Masons, or I don't
 know, some other secret societies, it's not, it's not ideologies, capitalism versus
 socialism versus something else, oh, the key players here is Christ, true Messiah, who
 is working in this world, he has his goals, his project, and the anti-Messiah, anti-Christ,
 whose spirit is always, has always been with us from the ancient times, okay, the spirit
 of anti-Messiah, anti-Christ, who has his project, and my feeling right now at this
 moment, and I think it's correct, is that anti-Christ is behind both of these parties
 who are in the war, so, and he is using objective reality, okay, it can be very true, okay,
 the statements that are used, okay, there is nationalism, there is, I don't know, some
 propaganda of, you know, this Western post-modern lifestyle, which is bad, there is this greed
 and will of power of, I don't know, some presidents, okay, imperialism, all these things, truly,
 they are there, and some people want to die for one reason, other people want to die for
 another reason, okay, they believe this is true, other believe that is true, and if you
 are willing to die for it, you go, you fight, you die, some people just die for money, some
 people die just for the fun of it, okay, they go fight for the fun of it, I've been there,
 I saw all these things, I saw all kinds of people, okay, including who don't have any
 faith in anything, only money and whatever, guns, including those who believe in God,
 they're faithful, and also they go there, okay, and even the leaders of the church and
 the clerics and the clergy, they don't represent the church as the whole church, okay, we need
 to understand that, if we see something said by patriarch, it doesn't mean that the church
 has this position, okay, everybody now is subject to this lie and deceit that's coming
 from antichrist, and it can be very persuasive, it's much more persuasive than what Lenin
 brought and was able to deceive so many people, Lenin is nothing compared to this, so right
 now this is what we are facing, and we should not say, oh, if the church supports that side,
 that's it, I don't believe in such church, it's fake, it's whatever, it's not the church,
 it's just some people, they have their own opinions, they watch TV, they listen to the
 radio for, I don't know, 30 years there was propaganda, okay, on both sides, okay, so,
 it becomes part of your world view, it becomes part of what you think is true, okay, this
 is our worldliness, the church has this limitation that it's embracing sometimes the logic of
 this world and not the world that is above, and this is why this experience of the true
 Messiah is so precious, I really feel that this is some kind of answer that our Lord
 Jesus Christ is giving me at this time in this context, I really feel that both sides,
 the Antichrist is behind it, and Christ is with those who suffer, Christ is with those
 who are out there, the orphans, people who are bombed, who need care, who need help,
 those who are injured on both sides, those who are in fear, who really need our compassion,
 our prayer, they need any help that we can give them, those who suffer, that's where
 we can serve Christ, where we can see Christ there, and this is what we need to do as much
 as we can, and also Lord is with those who pray, with those who repent, with those who
 put him in the center of their life, and only this can keep us away from this deceit which
 is worldwide and all-encompassing, it's creating different things, so it's conflicting, it's
 this or that or this or that, and you're confused, so we don't need to be confused, we don't need
 to just say oh I just don't care about all this, I just put a blanket and I just live
 my life, okay, devil is trying to split the people, it's either this or that, it's either
 the red army or the white army, if you don't support either you will just be killed in
 that conflict, in the process, it's either democrats or republicans, it's either socialist
 or communist, it's either this or that, right or left, and there is nothing else, we go
 above all of that, we don't care about all those splits and divisions, we try to get
 the message of the Lord, and the message of the Lord is that difficult times are coming,
 very difficult times, war, famine, whatever, deceit, death, fake Christianity, Pharisees,
 all kinds of superstitions, the new religion is coming, many spiritual deceits are coming,
 but behind all of that the Lord is also coming, and we are expecting, we are craving for his
 second coming, this is our greatest expectation, his glorious coming which will be on the day
 of the end of this world, when this world will end, don't expect him to come earlier
 to set some kingdom or some other nonsense, his kingdom will be the true kingdom, which
 will not have any evil, any sin remaining, okay, anything that's against his will, will
 be completely run according to his will, and we want to be children of this kingdom, and
 now we need to fight the good fight, with all the evils within us, that's in this world,
 so that the power, the fire of his resurrection can burn away every stain, every blemish from
 our hearts, from our souls, that we have no sins, no snakes, no passions that controls us,
 and we'll be guided by him, by his spirit, and that will hold us away from any delusion,
 any mistake, and will give us strength to go through any kind of temptation that might
 be out there, so the Church, as I understand it, as I feel it, the Church of Christ, where
 Christ is alive is not on either side of the conflict at this time, it is not, this is
 why I don't go and do some rallying or something for one side or another, for the, against
 the war, or for the war, or whatever, this is, for me, I feel it's not my calling, not
 my mission, not because I'm afraid, I'm not afraid to talk about it, okay, and if I need
 to risk my life to stop the Antichrist, I will, I hope, I have strength to do that, but at
 least from my mind I can say I'm willing to do that, hope not to run away, but, and I
 don't also persuade anyone to do anything, if you want to rally against something, you
 want to do activism, yes, or even you want to war against, it's all your conscience,
 but remember that whoever takes the sword, he will die from the sword, no matter what
 side he is on, this is not our method, and just do whatever your conscience tells you
 in this situation, try not to close your eyes, just go back, back before the war, before
 the virus, just go back, just face what we have to face at this time, at this moment,
 and be ready to face even worse things, much worse, even if the conflict is, happens in
 the place you are at right now, and if it's worse than what it is, be it nuclear war,
 be it plague, be it famine, whatever it would be, we need to be with the Lord and facing
 this challenge, let the Lord help us, give us his freedom from any delusion, from any
 passion, give us his guidance and revelation, so that we can have vision of what's going
 on, of how he wants me exactly, not just generally, but what is my mission in his eyes, what can
 I do for the true Messiah, because the fake Messiah can trick you, he really can do that,
 may the Lord help us, give us the joy of his resurrection, keep us from every mistake,
 and give us his blessing and guidance, I mean, Christ is risen, indeed he is risen.
