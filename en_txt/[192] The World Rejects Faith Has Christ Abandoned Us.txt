 Dear brothers and sisters, from the time of the Lord's coming 2000 years ago, the times
 are called the last times, the end of times.
 It's been already 2000 years, so you might be asking why is it end of times and why is
 it related to what is happening right now?
 We now think about this especially because we are facing the Christmas, the nativity
 of the Lord, expectation.
 The world expected the Lord's coming, now we are expecting also His coming.
 And we also expect His second coming and the end of the world.
 And it's actually, we are praying for the end of the world to come sooner, when we ask
 "Yea, come Lord!"
 This is the content of our prayer during the Liturgy.
 We are making it come faster, because we pray for this and the Lord, by hearing our prayer,
 He will make it faster.
 So you might think "No, no, we want to fight this evil, we want to postpone, we don't want
 Antichrist, but we know He is going to come before Christ, chronologically.
 You can say that we also hope that Antichrist comes sooner, because that will mean that
 the Lord is also coming to destroy him.
 Well at the same time the Holy Fathers, they said that the times of Antichrist will be
 a domination, will be really ugly in any respect, so they would not want to live in those times.
 So we can say both, it's like a paradox.
 Both we want it to happen faster, sooner, but also we don't want to get into that ugly
 life that's going to be when he comes, when Antichrist comes.
 So in the Church that happens very often, it doesn't fit the regular logic.
 But it's all true.
 Well anyhow, in the same way as before the Lord is coming, 2000 years ago, the world
 was immersed in evil.
 Because the sin could not be healed, it was before his resurrection.
 The sin could not be healed, the world did not know the truth, the full truth.
 So it reached some maturity, the Holy Fathers they say that the Lord allowed this world
 to slip into sin as much as you want.
 So it reached some measure, it was the full measure of sin, and the sin exposed itself
 to the utmost.
 And then the Lord came, and he gave salvation and solution, and some people, few, but some
 people, both among the Jews, he was very few, and among Gentiles, they received this salvation,
 and they received the cure, and they've turned the whole world upside down, and they proclaimed
 this truth to the whole world.
 And now the whole world knows everything already.
 So in the parable of those who are chosen, many are called, few are chosen.
 In that parable, the Lord calls, the Lord sends his servant to call those people.
 And some have field, some have ox, some have wife, they say no, we don't want to come.
 He calls this servant, he sends this servant to call them for a supper, that means it's
 evening time, and this is why the saints, they interpret this parable in the sense that
 now is the evening of the world, okay, the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was at the
 time, it's already evening, everything, most of the things that had to be done were done,
 accomplished, all the great philosopher, everything was already accomplished, but now
 the evening came, and he comes, and what is this evening?
 This evening is this participation in the Holy Eucharist, in the supper of the Lord.
 So the church is partaking of this supper for 2000 years already.
 We are participants of the supper, and we're inviting the whole world to take part in this
 supper.
 However, not everybody is willing, not everybody is coming, okay?
 And now the end of the world and the second coming is going to happen after this rejection
 of salvation, knowing the truth and being able to be healed, still rejecting and crucifying
 Christ.
 So this will be, there is this parallel, this parallel between the state of the world and
 those days and the state of the world now, and this rejection and this betrayal of Christ
 by Christians, there is rejection of Christ by everyone, all religions, is going to be
 coming to its utmost at the end of these times, okay, the end of the end times, okay?
 And I think now we are already by the end of this suppertime, okay, the last desserts
 are served, okay, it's almost about to finish, and this evil is so much because the Lord
 is allowing, okay, guys, you want to reject me, you want to sleep in satanism, you want
 to serve Mammon, okay, do it as much as you want, okay, so at the very end he is stepping
 aside, okay, and he is allowing this world to do whatever they want in terms of rejecting
 him, so this is why, including Christians, including Orthodox Christians, and of course
 including pagans and other religions, everybody is now sleeping into this rejection of salvation,
 lack of faith, lack of true love of Jesus Christ, and all the heresies, all the pseudo-Christian
 heresies that call themselves Christians, basically it's a way of finding a way to live
 without God, not following him, not loving him, not praying to him, but telling myself
 that I'm Christian, everything is fine, I'm saved, I believe in him, so I'm saved, okay,
 so all heresies, they have this in common, that practically speaking you're not Christian,
 but you persuade yourself that you are, okay, that's the nature of any heresy, okay, so
 it went in stages, okay, this rejection by the world, by former Christians, rejecting,
 going away, okay, the whole society, losing trust in him, losing faith, choosing mama,
 okay, because important is not who you believe you are, important what you live like, do
 you follow Christ, to talk about this, first of all, we need to repent, we need to know
 that we are the worst, otherwise we're gonna be judging others, okay, I don't want to judge
 anyone here, I'm now talking about the phenomena, I'm talking about the evil that's increasing
 and why it's increasing, so this living faith, following Christ, praying, loving Christ,
 trusting him, trusting him and not trusting money and income, okay, choosing to follow
 him through ascetism, fasting, nobody wants that, okay, so all these things, they show
 that on daily basis you love him, he is important to you and people like this are few and we
 see now that even among Orthodox Christians, even among non-Orthodox, even among the clergy
 and the bishop, this lack of faith is getting stronger, in the same way as in those days
 the true faith among the Jews was disappearing, they became Pharisees, they became showing
 them who were righteous, external, following all the rituals, but in their heart, not loving
 Christ, not willing to change, not willing to abandon other sins, choosing mammon, choosing
 to serve devil and crucify in Christ, so the final Antichrist is going to be just the accomplishment
 of all this lack of faith in Christ, this is why the Lord will say, you want it, okay,
 have it, okay, have that kind of lifestyle, have this leader who is going to fulfill all
 your dreams, give you peace, give you joy and there are many candidates already who
 came up, there is a new candidate who is coming now, okay, for the Antichrist and maybe I'll
 say about that next time, but my point is not the Antichrist, my point is that we are
 lacking the true faith in Christ, that's the source of all the problems and this beast
 that is inside of every one of us is coming out, okay, in different cultures, this is
 why all these cultures become similar, become very similar, be it Hinduist, be it Chinese,
 be it African, it will be more and more similar, okay, people have similar clothes, similar
 tattoos, similar things, you know, common social networks, all this, okay, no difference
 in between religions, one religion that is going to embrace all the religions, so these
 are all the signs that this beast, this lack of faith is exposing itself, is manifesting
 itself openly, okay, no matter how bad the world is, the Lord can find his followers,
 in the same way as in the fallen world of those days, Jesus, he found followers among
 the Jews, they became holy apostles, they were very few, later apostle Paul found the followers
 of God among the Gentiles, they were also very few, in the same way now these days the
 Lord can find his followers among this evil apostasy, all these things and we really want
 to be among those followers, we ask him to give us wisdom, to give us guidance, to teach
 us how to be vigilant, not to be asleep spiritually, and only that can save us from all this evil,
 from all the delusion that is coming, and also we can say that because of lack of faith
 of us as Christians, nominal Christians, this evil is increasing, we can also say that because
 of faith of some people, I don't want to say the names, okay, there are several religions
 in the world who are waiting for Messiah, not one, there's quite a few, they are waiting
 for the Messiah to come, not for the second coming of Christ, the end of the world, no,
 they are waiting for some Messiah to come, and we know that this Messiah is going to
 be the Antichrist, and we can say that their faith now is stronger than faith of Christians,
 because the Lord said, according to your faith, it will be according to your faith, it will
 be accomplished to you, so their faith and their effort to bring this Messiah to come
 to this world is going to be so great, so strong, that he will come, the Lord says,
 you really want it so much, here you have, let you have it, so this is also something
 that we need to be worried, the people who serve satan and are willing to have his representative
 come to this world, they become stronger in faith than we are, we who believe in Jesus
 Christ, this is a problematic thing, so let us become strong in our faith, in what we
 ask, in how we search for truth, how we create the kingdom of heaven, how are we willing
 to be his witnesses every day of our life, through how we live, through our prayer, through
 our spiritual life, effort, eskettism, how much we pursue him in everything, sacrifice
 ourselves to serve him, and not to serve mammon our sins and be asleep spiritually, may the
 Lord help us, awaken us, give us strong will, give us wisdom, give us guidance, and save
 us from all those delusions and mistakes that are coming upon the whole world big time,
 including Christians, heretics, and orthodox Christians, unfortunately also, we see how
 even priests and hierarchs become victims of propaganda just about politics, that means
 that there is lack of faith, because with true faith you separate politics and faith,
 you are able to see that anything related to politics is related to this world and is
 going to pass by, is going to make people separated, divided, die, ok, just an example,
 just a quick example, we have some people think, oh, the more churches we build the
 better, other people, I'm talking about orthodox now, with catholics, it's the same, even worse,
 I'm talking about orthodox, we need to build more churches, other people say, no, we need
 to baptize as many people as we can, ok, now we have a war, orthodox are killing orthodox,
 well nominal, I don't know how faithful are people who go and kill their brothers, but,
 and not only brothers, sisters and children, anyhow, they are all baptized, so the church
 exert, many people say baptize more, more, come, come, yes, now they are baptized, they
 are killing each other, so they are just dying in thousands, so did it help baptizing them,
 maybe you should have focused on something else, and how about churches, building more
 and more, build here and there, now it's all blown up, fire, destroyed by, ok, bombs, so
 the Lord allows this to happen, why, maybe you were losing, you are focusing on something
 else, something wrong, maybe something else could have been done to avoid people hating
 each other so much and killing each other, ok, so, this all comes from the lack of faith,
 trying to replace true faith with some external stuff, becoming Pharisees and believing in
 ritual and some external things, fetish, ok, so let us be wise, let us focus on spiritual
 life, on ascotism, spirituality, mission, and becoming true followers of Christ, not
 just nominally, yes, I'm Orthodox, this means nothing, you need to become true follower
 of Jesus Christ, Orthodox, faith, yes, you need to be Orthodox, not to have any errors,
 any mistakes about your faith, but you need to follow him, not just declare that you are
 Orthodox, let us become true witnesses of Christ, his children, and may he let us trample,
 conquer, devil, and all the evil that we may come across, may the Lord give us his blessing
 I mean.
