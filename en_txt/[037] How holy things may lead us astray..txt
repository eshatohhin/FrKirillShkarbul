 Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say about what we can do to fight in this
 spiritual war that is going on and now we see it's getting worse, ok, this situation
 is getting worse.
 We receive very strong hits, ok, one hit, just today I received a message with the list
 of all the priests who died from this pandemic, ok, and the devil is trying to scare the church
 by killing so many people, ok, you see so many people have died from this pandemic so
 you have to be in fear so that I can implement my future things that I want to do, ok, so
 this fear we have to withstand, we are not afraid of anything, ok, by faith, ok, we are
 aware of the dangers of this pandemic but we are not afraid of it and of devil, ok,
 we will still be strong in spirit and we will overcome all the challenges that are coming.
 We see this big hit that's coming with this split that they are trying to make within
 the Orthodox Church, ok, this is another big hit impact of the devil, this attack on the
 church and this is also important crisis.
 In these times of war, these times of turmoil in the church we need to know that the Lord
 is allowing this to happen because of the spiritual problems that we have within the
 church, this is the main reason why we are getting all these hits, all these injuries
 and we need to strengthen our faith, everyone of us, the whole church and everyone of us
 can make a big contribution, important contribution in overcoming all these challenges and becoming
 even stronger, ok, so today I want to say about the problem of too much relying on some
 sacrificial and holy objects, rites, rituals and other things, ok, in the past I've talked
 about even bigger issue, we have not have to remember that, the biggest problem is lack
 of faith and lack of interest in spiritual life, ok, being lazy, spiritually lazy and
 idle and cold, ok, you know, or warm, ok, not hot, this is what Christ is telling to
 the churches that if you are still warm and you won't get hot, I will destroy you, I will
 remove you from your place, you will lose everything, so this is big issue that we have,
 this is the biggest issue, nobody cares about spiritual life, about prayer, ok, not willing
 to put effort into fasting, into reading the gospel, into spiritual life, this is the biggest,
 the most important big problem that we have and the second, well, not the second but another
 problem is that when we decide to, ok, be spiritually active, religiously active, we
 might get the wrong guidance, ok, and wrong examples, ok, that our efforts will be put
 in the wrong direction and we will also fail if we have that and many people get this wrong
 thing, wrong direction, this direction comes from paganism, ok, that lives within every
 one of us and as a pagan, well, everybody used to be pagans at some point, worshipping
 idols, this comes from a man losing God and after Adam man lost heavens, lost God, lost
 paradise and because of that there is this craving to be again with God, ok, and this
 nostalgia is realized through some holy objects, ok, people get some holy object and it's related
 to God and he feels better, ok, that, ok, now at least I have little relationship, connection
 with God, ok, so this is where it's coming from but the problem is that this pagan mindset
 is still alive within us and we begin to think that this is very important and we put too
 much emphasis on this, ok, holy oil, holy rope, ok, that we have some objects, holy
 stuff from some monastery or from somewhere else, ok, and we think that, ok, like that
 we sort of control this holy things, grace and it will be with us and, ok, this is big
 issue that can make the whole, our whole relationship with God go astray because what the Lord wants
 from us is to have our hearts changed by faith and this means that every day the faith is
 changing our life in some way, ok, we are pushing ourselves, we are striving to follow
 Christ, to change the way we live, what we do, to get rid of some bad habits, of some
 passions, ok, to pray more, ok, we force ourselves, we exert some effort upon ourselves and this
 is what is precious for the Lord and there is nothing wrong of course with having icons
 and with having crosses and other holy things and with pilgrimage, ok, going to some holy
 places, there is nothing wrong with it as long as we keep the balance, as long as our
 priorities are set in the right way and the highest priority for us is not to touch as
 many holy things as possible or to hang as many holy things as we can or to put as many
 candles as we can, you know, the most important thing for us is to change ourselves as I said
 and I want to read from the pistol of the saint apostle Paul to Hebrews this is chapter 11 from
 verse 33, ok, this is an example of people who what they've done by faith, ok, and what
 we are expected by God to do by faith, ok, so these people through faith they, through
 faith subdued kingdoms, subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the
 mouth of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness
 were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens,
 women received their dead reason to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance
 that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and
 scourgings, yeah, moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they
 were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins
 being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the whole world was not worthy they wandered
 in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these having obtained
 a good report through faith, ok, they have received the good report, ok, the Lord said
 yes you've done your job, ok, you passed, and this is what we need to see, we think
 oh I cannot do this and that and I am so limited with my abilities they've subdued kingdoms,
 ok, and even armies of aliens they chased away by faith, ok, not by any power, money,
 even influence, whatever, by faith, faith is the greatest power that there is, ok, because
 by faith God is with us and he does the job, ok, and we need to have this faith and this
 is what we need to value the most, ok, and we see in the early Christian church, ok,
 those Christians they did not hang crosses, ok, outside and put any other things on their
 arms and, you know, or special clothes, no, to show that they are Christians, but everybody
 knew that these guys they are Christians, ok, because their hearts are full of love,
 because they live in another way, because it's shining from their faces, their faith,
 and this is was obvious for others, ok, but we now nowadays Christians very often we become
 hypocrites, ok, we want to show, ok, I have some good things, I go to some holy place
 and whatever, and we sort of use this as a proof, ok, while inside we have completely
 different thing, ok, and this is hypocrisy, ok, when inside you are not Christians, you
 don't have Christ living in you, but you try to persuade everybody, yes, I am Christian,
 ok, so this is a big problem that we are having in the church, inside the church, and we need
 to do something about it, on a daily basis, ok, on a daily basis we need to exert some
 effort and say, ok, today by faith, what have I done by faith, ok, have I forgiven some
 enemy or have I served clients on the job in a Christian way with love, have I done
 something by faith today, and if not we go and do it, ok, may God help you, give you
 this power of faith, we always have this task, ok, my faith I want to have it stronger, I
 want to have a burning heart that is full of faith, and I am not just, ok, squeezing it
 out from myself, I am asking Lord to give it to me as a gift, to grant it to me, and
 I am doing everything possible to please my Lord and to do this testimony of His love
 to everybody around me, I mean, may Lord help you and give you this eagerness, this
 bravery to go and change everything around you by faith, to become stronger, and thereby
 the whole church will get stronger, may Lord help you and bless you, I mean.
