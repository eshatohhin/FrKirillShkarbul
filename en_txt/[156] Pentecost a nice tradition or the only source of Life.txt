 Dear brothers and sisters, we arrive to the Great Feast of the Pentecost.
 This feast is connected directly to the resurrection of Christ.
 It is exactly 50 days, on the 50th day after the resurrection of Christ.
 And we know 50 is the completion, it is 49, 49 is 7 times 7, so on the 50th day it was
 the jubilee year, and all the slaves were released, and all the deaths were forgiven,
 and the land had to rest.
 And this also is eternity, it is telling us about eternity, seven days, the eighth day
 is the eternal day, and we have the 7 times 7, and on the next day is the day of completion.
 So what is this completion, what is this meaning?
 For us to have a greater understanding of the Pentecost, we need to talk about the Holy
 Spirit, because this is the day when the Holy Spirit came down on the apostles.
 They received the baptism from the Holy Spirit, and they became one church, not scattered,
 just individual disciples, but now they are one body of Christ.
 And the significance of this is so great, that this is the beginning of the whole year
 until next year's Lent, so every Sunday the church will come from the Pentecost, it will
 be the first Sunday of the Pentecost, the second Sunday of the Pentecost, all the way
 to right before we enter into the Great Lent.
 So this means that the church lives in this Pentecost all the time, and very often for
 us it is very unclear what do we receive, yes, the disciples, they receive the Holy
 Spirit in the form of the fires, the flames that came down on the head of each apostle,
 it was such a great event, they spoke different languages and they preached the gospel to
 many nations, but how about us, what about us, what is going to change, what are we praying
 for, what is special about this feast, if I don't have the Holy Spirit, what will I
 pray about?
 We also know that this is the Feast of the Holy Trinity, it's called the Feast of the
 Holy Trinity, and there are reasons for that.
 Let us have an overall view of the Holy Trinity, we won't go too deep into theology, but
 just very briefly, the will or what has to be done, the idea and the big order comes
 from God the Father, and he is the source and the origin and the reason of everything.
 So this is why God's Son is born from God's Father and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the
 Father, because the Father is the reason and the origin of everything, and his will, the
 will of God comes from God's Father, and God the Son, he is the Holy Word, the Word
 of God, and the word is meaning that not only what the Lord says to this world, but also
 what he accomplishes, and this begins from creation, so this is why this world is created,
 and we say "through the Son", but not through like the medium, it means that he creates
 this world, it's this action, whatever God does in this world is done by God the Son,
 and this is why this great accomplishment of salvation is done by Jesus Christ who is
 the Word of God, and now the Holy Spirit, he accomplishes the whole project, so the
 whole project is accomplished by the Holy Spirit, he is a life-giving spirit, he gives
 a life to this world, and he keeps it alive, and more importantly he keeps alive us spiritually,
 he gives us the spiritual life, and he makes the project that is done, the mission of Christ,
 bring fruit and be accomplished in this world, and this is why we say that the acts of the
 apostles, what happened after the pouring down of the Holy Spirit on the disciples, this
 is the gospel of the Holy Spirit, it is actually what the Holy Spirit accomplished, so the
 Holy Spirit is not just spiritual, we are talking about spiritual things only, we see
 that in this real material world many things that are accomplished are accomplished by
 the coming down of the Holy Spirit.
 So having said this, of course this is very brief, very overall, okay, but let us just
 have this in mind, this overall intuition about the Holy Trinity, it's not just all
 just Holy Trinity, no, God is Holy Trinity, okay, so let us talk about the Spirit, the
 Holy Spirit, this is a very big topic, and we need to talk about Spirit, and there are
 many topics regarding Spirit, we can talk about Spirit versus matter, Spirit versus
 body, we can, soul, body, Spirit, we can have different frameworks, we can talk about Spirit
 and information, which is also abstract, you cannot touch it, we can talk about Spirit
 and ideas, the world of ideas, okay, we can talk about Spirit and energy, okay, some people
 think that Spirit is just some energy that fills you, and you feel, wow, this is great
 influx of Holy Spirit, this is also wrong, there are many, many things that we can talk
 about in regards to Spirit in general and the Holy Spirit, but we cannot cover all of
 this today, today I want to focus on what the Lord Himself, and on the Last Supper before
 He departed, He talked with the disciples, and He told them, this is John 14 verse 15
 to 17, okay, "If you love Me, give My commandments, and I will pray the Father, and He will give
 you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom
 the world cannot receive, because it sees Him not, neither knows Him, but you know Him,
 for He dwells with you, and shall be in you," okay, we very often, we pray the main prayer
 to the Holy Spirit of Heavenly King, the Comforter, we call the Holy Spirit the Comforter, and
 what does this mean? In Greek, the word is parakletis, well, the stress is parakletis,
 but in English we say parakletis, the word in Hebrew is menachem, menachem is also Comforter,
 coming from the verb nacham, and we can make a big lecture on this, okay, but just to say
 the most important part, okay, well, first of all, we say, we see that the Lord says,
 I will, God Father will send you another Comforter, so who is Comforter now? Jesus Christ Himself
 was Comforter when He was with them in His body on earth, so He is Comforter in several
 ways, okay, the word Comforter, there are several key meanings to this word, first of
 all, it's someone to rely upon, they followed Him, He told them what to do, whenever some
 Pharisees argued with them, they could ask Him for support, He was the one, the source
 of support and reliance and guidance to them when He was on earth, okay, and also He would
 debate on their behalf with those who accused them for doing something, okay, so He was
 also Vindicator, so this is another aspect of it, okay, it's a helper, and He also prayed
 for them, so He was the one who would pray on their behalf to God the Father, so all
 of these aspects are included in this word Comforter, and now the Holy Spirit will be
 the Comforter for you, He said, so He will be your source of support, so whenever you
 feel that you're lonely, you don't have support of your friends, your family, or whoever,
 you will be supported by the Holy Spirit, whenever you need guidance and you don't want
 to rely just on your opinion, He will be your guidance, whenever you don't understand, you
 have a question, He will be the one who will give you the answer, okay, when somebody's
 going to accuse you, He will be the one who defends you, who will be your advocate, okay,
 He will be on your behalf, He will be protecting you in that way, so He's your Helper, He's
 your Comforter, He's your Reliance, you will rely on Him, and this is, we remember, when
 they will pull you to the synagogues or some councils and accuse you of many things, don't
 think ahead of time what to say and how to behave, the Holy Spirit will say what has
 to be said at the moment, so this testimony about truth is also done when we rely on the
 Holy Spirit, it's through the Holy Spirit that we can bring this testimony about Christ,
 okay, so these many aspects, we now have two situations we sometimes need people to rely
 upon, we need some support, we ask for a second opinion, okay, we feel that we ourselves are
 failing in many different situations, but we need someone to be near, to be by our side,
 and there is no person around and we get into depression and we are failing, we're lost
 because we don't have this support, we don't have the Comforter with us, and now we are
 praying that the Lord be with us, that the Holy Spirit comes down upon us and we can
 rely upon Him and He would be with us, okay, so this is one situation, another situation
 similar, somewhat different, is when we experience some harm, some things are stolen, or something
 really bad happens to us, somebody harms us, okay, we feel we lose peace, okay, I think
 you have this experience that some things are stolen from you, you don't know what to
 do, you run here, you run there, you try this, you try that, you don't have peace, you want
 to compensate for that, or you want to retaliate, some people they want to harm back, okay,
 retaliate, to have some peace, okay, now it's fine, so all of that creates this gap that
 we have, this frustration if you want, so the Holy Spirit, He will be the one who will
 relieve you from all these things, no matter what happens with you, you will have the relief,
 the Holy Spirit as your relief, your Comforter, so this is how important for us this feast,
 and we see that the world doesn't hear, doesn't see, and of course, now I've talked about
 some psychological side of it, but this is much deeper, this is spiritual, and we should
 not think that the Holy Spirit is just some feeling, okay, some, so we need to experience
 on the Pentecost something feeling, you want feeling, you can go to some therapy, I don't
 know, some sauna, okay, you have some bucket of cold water, and you feel something, okay,
 you go to some other hot spring or something, you feel something, this is not about feelings,
 not something like this, none of the physical, emotional, no, this is much, much very different,
 it's spirituality, and of course, all that, those sects that are talking about the Spirit
 pouring down on you so that you are falling down, or you're laughing, or you're speaking
 different some strange things, well, that's maybe evil spirits, it's not the Holy Spirit
 at all, okay, another thing that we need to say is we, which is related in the Old Testament,
 we read that the Spirit, of course, the Spirit, this word is ruach, is like wind that comes,
 okay, and the word comforter, menachem, is also related, this nachem, this verb, is related
 to breath, okay, it's to give relief of breath, it can be used to denote that, so when we
 are squeezed, we are pressed by this world, or by our passions, or by whatever, we sort
 of cannot breathe spiritually, we cannot breathe, we are tied up, okay, so to relieve us, to
 give us breath, we need the comforter, he makes us breathe spiritually, he makes us
 have spiritual wellness, okay, but not in the yoga sense, of course, in terms of relief
 from sufferings, from pressure, from all kind of tribulations, temptations, while still
 being in those tribulations, he gives us the spiritual breath, and we are not conquered
 by all of that, we are not shaken.
 So this is also interesting, okay, and now the question, the final question comes, what
 do we do, how do we have the Holy Spirit come down upon us, and the one clue, of course,
 is we read today from the Gospel, when the Lord said, who loves me will keep my commandments,
 that's a prerequisite, if we don't keep the commandments of Christ, we don't try to live
 selfless life, okay, not to rely on material things, not to serve mammon, okay, we keep
 our heart clean, all these things, we live by the Gospel, we strive to live by the Gospel,
 this is one necessary figure, without this we will not receive the Holy Spirit, and another
 very important part is that we cannot pull the Holy Spirit down to us, it's not some
 mechanical thing, that, okay, you just do ABC and you get this, it's not yoga, it's
 not fitness, it's not something that must, the Holy Spirit is God himself, and he breathes
 wherever he wants, so the Holy Spirit will come whenever he decides to come down upon
 you, to your heart, so our part is to prepare the vessel for the Holy Spirit to come, we
 know that he can come, but if we don't have the vessel ready, well, if he comes, no use,
 because there will be no place for him to stay, so our task is just that, okay, we have
 to make this our priority, our main goal to prepare the vessel of our heart for the Holy
 Spirit, and to pray eagerly for him to come, we don't care, oh, what's the Holy Spirit?
 How many of us are praying for the Holy Spirit to come down?
 And the Lord says, will not God the Father send the Holy Spirit to those who are asking,
 are crying for the Holy Spirit, our day and night, are we doing that?
 Do we have that feeling that I do need the Holy Spirit to come down upon me?
 Not many people, almost none, even among Christians, that this is a problem, that I need to pray
 to the Lord to give me the Holy Spirit, how often do we pray like that?
 We pray to solve some problems, to help us here, to do this, to do that.
 We need to understand that without the Holy Spirit, we cannot do anything.
 We don't have the Comforter come and give us this strength, this daringness to serve
 the Lord, that without the Comforter, we cannot be Christians, we cannot do anything.
 So this is our goal, this is our priority.
 We have to prepare the vessel and we have to pray all the time and ask the Lord to send
 the Holy Spirit to us, and believe me, this will happen.
 And we need to have great gratitude to the Lord, thank Him.
 Whenever we feel that the Holy Spirit is coming to our life, changing our life, and to treasure
 this.
 Oh, now Pentecost, okay, good, we celebrate, we chant, we have some song, oh good, good
 gun, and then we move on and we say, well then we don't get anything, we don't receive
 the Holy Spirit, and we don't live the whole year in the Holy Spirit with the Holy Spirit.
 And this is accomplishment of the whole Pascha, the resurrection of Christ, this is the goal
 that the Lord set, so that His disciples, they will receive the Holy Spirit and they
 will continue and go do His mission in this world, and this is our task.
 May the Lord help us, give us the Holy Spirit.
 This is also related to grace, it's very important to say that in our secular life, we replace
 the Holy Spirit with what?
 With money.
 Whenever you have a problem, don't you think that, okay, if I have money I will solve it.
 Now I'm impressed by some troubles, I need to pay bills, I'm stressed out, if I have
 money I will solve the problem.
 So money becomes a replacement of grace, so that's why the Lord said you cannot serve
 both mammon and God.
 You can call mammon God, okay, but it will be mammon, it will be still mammon.
 So we see this big risk to look for some other surrogates of the Holy Spirit and grace of
 God, and this is what we live for, we fill our life with all that stuff, we're trying
 to seek for the Holy Spirit anywhere, everywhere, but not for the Holy Spirit, for this comfort,
 for this relief everywhere, in a property, in some people go traveling in here and this,
 and some people go to drugs and alcohol and other things.
 Okay, this is some search for fake relief, fake comforters.
 So this is really dangerous and it's killing the world, let us not be fooled, not be mistaken,
 the true comfort, the true relief, it all comes from God and the Holy Spirit can solve
 all these problems whenever we live in Him with Him.
 May the Lord give us His guidance, His grace and keep us away from any deception, from
 any tricks of the devil, and be His faithful and daring ministers, witnesses with the Holy
 Spirit, relying upon the Holy Spirit, fulfilled with the Holy Spirit and humble, because only
 humbleness, blessed are the poor in spirit, when we get rid of our own spirit, that's
 when we have the vessel, so that we may be poor in spirit and be vessels of the Holy
 Spirit.
 I mean, may the Lord bless you and Merry Pentecost to every one of you, I mean.
