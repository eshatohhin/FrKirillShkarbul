 Dear friends, welcome to the mission channel of the Orthodox Christian Church in Taiwan.
 I'm Fr. Kirill Skarbol and we are now in the exaltation of the Holy Cross Church in Taipei.
 If you are not yet Orthodox, you can learn more about the authentic faith of the Church,
 the Church of the Apostles that has preserved the true faith in Christ for 2000 years.
 We will talk about Orthodox spirituality, about prayer. If you are already Orthodox,
 you can also learn how to become a stronger soldier of Christ and to win the evil both inside
 and outside in this world. We will talk about modern world issues in light of the Gospel.
 We will learn about prayer. We will learn how to avoid deception of the evil that is in this world.
 Let us be united. Let us pray for each other because we need to be together as Christ has
 told us. Let us learn together how to do mission and how to do the testimony about the Word of God
 in this world with God's help and to His glory. I mean, God bless.
