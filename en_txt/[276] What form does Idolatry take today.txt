 Dear brothers and sisters, today's video will be a little bit scary because all
 of us will discover that we are idol worshippers to some extent but don't be
 scared too much okay because this is not about calling names this is about
 understanding the reality okay and then working with this reality if we want to
 be healed we need to know the sickness okay know yourself this is the first
 call of the Holy Fathers then you will know God so we need to be critical we
 need to be humble and this will help us in our repentance with our eagerness to
 change to become apostles in the sense of gaining God into our heart and being
 able to share him with others okay this is the goal of every Christian okay so
 and this is what makes us Christians okay unless we don't reach that we are
 not yet Christians to the full in the full sense so myself included okay so
 let us let us talk about this some time ago I had a video on the revelation on a
 fake fake revelation not the previous not book over revelation enlightenment
 sorry fake enlightenment you can go back and see it okay today I want to talk
 about idol worshipping and spiritually what it is because normally we would say
 idol worshipper is the one who goes to those temples and does sacrifices to
 idols which are standing there he is a pagan okay like here in Taiwan 97% of
 population are pagans they go there either because they really believe and
 have some communication expectation from those idols or they go there because of
 custom because they're supposed to okay so but the problem is that anyone okay
 who doesn't worship the true God every day in his heart continuously actually
 becomes an idol worshiper normally we think well we get educated and this idol
 worshipping is just some superstition it is maybe some uneducated folk who are
 in darkness okay they used to believe all kinds of the Dracula's or some other
 stuff and they have these superstitions okay they believe in the Sun in the
 mother earth in I don't know some goddesses I don't know be it Poseidon
 or Zeus Jupiter or something else gave ease these people they just don't
 understand that the sea if it's not a god it's just a sea a Sun is not the
 God's soul it's it's just Sun it's just a star okay it's shining so we learn
 some scientific knowledge and okay we get rid of it okay everything is fine
 we're not idol worshippers anymore well we discover that the idol worshipping is
 not a matter of education it's not a matter of knowing something it is a
 spiritual need and this need is fulfilled with something else as soon as
 you get upset or don't believe into some mythical gods you will accept something
 else as a substitute okay this is how the human heart is designed human soul
 is designed it cannot be just on its own just free from any delusion okay the
 spirit is craving for something for something to rely upon for something to
 become the source of salvation of help of I don't know enlightenment okay but
 we will talk about this mechanism a bit later in this video well first I'll
 bring some examples came in the Soviet times in Soviet Union and in many other
 socialist countries okay people said oh we are so learned we are educated
 everybody goes to school now we have science technology okay of course we
 don't believe in those superstitions and stuff like that well and then in the
 times of like early Soviet Union okay all the way till the 60s okay there was
 a belief in Communist Party in the progress it actually dragged all through
 70s in bright future into almighty science technology okay all these things
 are idols and there were also idols like Yuri Gagarin okay who went to this space
 all those big projects okay like the Dnipro gas okay those power plants and
 you know other big projects that the whole country were working on they all
 became idols if you read news of those days okay it's about building something
 big huge okay go into space this is this and that these all are idols okay of
 those days some later it became like movie heroes okay everybody loved them
 and basically those became idols okay but eventually this the Soviet Union
 collapsed so now it's not that big that kind of idol worshipping but the more
 common now is the so-called capitalist or like the post modern post capitalist
 well it's about what it's about for many people it's money comfort some
 brands what kind of car make you have okay it's some it's an idol it's
 important watch what what is your watch okay what you would boast about okay it
 may be your career your profession because your idol in the West many people
 compare their houses okay my house is 1 million yours is 5 million okay
 somebody lives in a rented apartment okay people compare these things and it
 is some reality that is very important for them okay they dedicate all their
 life pursuing some something like that so they think they their trust is in
 the real estate and their glory is in that real estate that they want others
 to see that becomes their idol okay so all kinds of I know we have this post
 modernist idols which are even more bizarre okay that you are I don't know
 zero carbon something okay now they open that pub in London where you go drink
 beer and you do the pedaling so the electricity is coming from there so they
 go zero carbon bar or something like that so some people are crazy about that
 but yoga about I don't know a new age stuff that's a new idols and what about
 all those actors and all musicians gay singers Lady Gaga or something else I
 don't know what what is popular now but those become idols and they're cold you
 have official name idols okay in those magazines they call them idols okay
 because this is they are idols okay so it is about idol worshiping seems to be
 funny not so serious but spiritually tease that's why it's attracting
 millions of people or those the sports the games okay Olympics that's an idol
 you're attracting so much money so much people to go watch people kicking some
 empty you ball okay emptiness so we need to see that the reason is spiritual
 reality actually sport was also an idol in the Soviet times and it still is in
 those countries politics that's another idol okay how many people worship Trump
 okay or Democrats or whatever those that's idol worshiping for many of them
 it is idol worshiping if you discover that you can argue with somebody about
 okay who is better president or something like that you get on just step
 aside and say okay whatever well let's talk about Jesus let's pray if you're
 like really into some argument on that thing your idol worshiper okay so
 sometimes here even in the church okay we have services we we praise markers
 for crushing the idols for overthrowing demons and then we go out and we are
 crazy about politics about I don't know consumption about purchasing some stuff
 okay isn't we need to understand there there's something wrong about it we
 either we either want to crush the idols or we want to worship okay it doesn't go
 together so we can be ten times Orthodox games ultra Orthodox Christians but that
 would be only nominal only formal in the reality we will be idol worshipers many
 priests are idol worshipers this is the reality we need to face it okay but first
 of all we begin with ourselves okay it's very easy to see idol worshipers
 everywhere but not yourself so this is something to be careful with so and I
 know is normally not something which is standing out there or written in the
 book on the page on some commercial no an idol is first of all in here and in
 in in your heart okay it can be invisible you yourself can become an
 idol you worship yourself why is this happening this is happening well because
 the man every man we have a fallen nature it's a nature human nature
 inherited from Adam and Eve and it's it has this flaw to it it's not a sin it's
 not it is what Catholics call original sin we don't call it a scene but it's
 like a primordial flaw and because of this when we don't have relationship
 with the true God constantly ongoing we will be tending to substitute it with
 something else and it's not about education it's about spiritual thing we
 will try to find what to reliable is it savings is it my diploma is it my
 friend's relatives is it something for some people their kids are their idol
 idols so they would put all their hope into their kids kids because this is
 where they want to get salvation and glory so this is I know worshiping you
 this is so common I mean we look around this is everywhere in us okay our love
 towards our kids or our spouse becomes and I don't worship this is scary
 reality but but it is okay the true love is always self sacrificing and it's
 always overcoming the selfishness and some passions but we are driven by a big
 force and this towards some activities okay and that force is what that force
 is an unclean spirit which is pushing us towards some goal and the only spirit
 which is clean is the Holy Spirit and we need to be honest to ourselves that very
 often it's not the Holy Spirit driving us towards pursuing or doing this and
 that it's some other spirit like we can say for the young people games became
 their idols they can spend so much time in those games trying to find some
 pleasure from them or for bloggers okay for anyone who is posting constantly on
 Facebook these and that and that collecting likes okay light is a little
 sacrifice it's like a candle somebody is putting a candle towards you as an idol
 okay could be be careful with those things this is why it may be so pleasing
 so you know driving when you get more likes oh that's mainly vainglory okay
 when when people are posting some kind of useless stuff and they cannot do
 without it it becomes an addiction okay that means that this became your idol
 of vainglory of many things okay you rely upon this thing so okay now also
 let us consider the confession okay we confess we receive Holy Communion we
 try to live holy life stop sinful addictions or habits then after some
 time maybe a week a month later we are pulled towards some something that we
 have stopped okay beat I don't know playing games or chatting all the time
 or watching movies every night or something else okay or I don't know for
 some people drinking going to some parties you feel lonely you want party
 okay when that comes you should know that this is my idol worship I have not
 overcome some of the you know okay let's call it demon worshiping because this
 passion is behind is an unclean spirit and it's pushing me towards that
 direction I am still I think I go to the church I receive communion I confess I
 am Orthodox I'm Christian no problem but no okay if you give in to that you know
 force it's coming from you it's not coming from somewhere else then we give
 in to remaining idol worshipers okay so let us first be honest with ourselves I
 am still an idol worshiper even though I think I was in the church for 20 years
 for 50 years I'm maybe even a priest or a monk or whatever I'm still an idol
 worshiper this is reality this is truth let us be honest to ourselves let us see
 those spirits the spirits of vainglory of greed of mammon all kinds of mammon
 anger okay you go come home and you get angry at your kids and then you say why
 why I'm like this okay then you keep without it for some time then again that
 means that you still give in to this idol of anger that is a new the two
 main idols kill me just to summarize it's it's called the belly and the mammon
 and they are actually one the belly is just something you want to consume want
 to satisfy receive some comfort tasty okay and the mammon is basically you
 want to grab I know some resources some funds to have more power to have okay to
 have glory which is associated with that and then stuff like that so these are
 great idols which are present everywhere and we need to be watchful okay we
 cannot really serve God well we cannot really do any testimony we cannot really
 be Christians if we are still worshiping idols so this is this has never gone
 anywhere okay we live in Babylon we live in idolatry it's all around us but first
 we need to become begin with ourselves okay we need to set ourselves on the
 path of spiritual life to see that there is no other option we either leave with
 God or with idols okay the idol of no I'm just autonomous this is fake this
 is this is this never happens okay if you're without God you will be with the
 demons okay you will be with your idols okay and you won't even notice it but
 you will be blinded and you will be a slave eventually as a sacrifice to devil
 okay this is how it ends may the Lord keep us away from every uncleanness from
 any from any desire from any mistake you know another form of idol if this is
 very subtle is when we have some big drive we think it's spiritual this is
 very common in Catholicism but there is it's also present in the Orthodox Church
 that we want to do something that we think okay this for God yeah I do so
 many Jesus prayer operators or I go in ministry do some ministry or something
 like that and I have a big drive for that well stop and think where is this
 coming from can I preserve the peace of heart can I pray can it be humble while
 doing this or it makes me okay stirred up and you know with with some zeal in
 my eyes okay you know doing this can we need to be to learn how to distinguish
 the eagerness of faith which the Lord is expecting from us from this carnal
 emotional and fake okay delusion that masks itself as though this is eagerness
 okay so this will bring us also to idol worshipping okay this is a something
 very it may be more difficult to distinguish than other idols which I've
 mentioned but the more we read the Holy Fathers the more we pray and live with
 Christ the more we gain this ability from the Lord to distinguish to
 distinguish the spirit coming from him from the spirit coming from the Maven
 may the Lord help us give us his strength wisdom guidance and blessing to
 minister him every day of our life and to glorify him I mean God bless brothers
 and sisters
