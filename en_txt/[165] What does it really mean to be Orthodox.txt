 Dear brothers and sisters, sometimes people ask me what is the Orthodox faith in essence.
 We see history, we see traditions, we see these priests, vestments, we see many things,
 but of course there is the dogmatics, some people say that all this, the right dogmatics,
 this is the Orthodox faith.
 Well, in the first centuries we didn't have all those dogmatics.
 So in essence, if we look what the Orthodox faith is and Orthodox relationship with the
 Lord, it is the true authentic relationship of love, loving Christ without any departure,
 without any addition, so it's much more simple than it may seem to be.
 It's not that difficult, not that complex, and any heresy, any schism, departure from
 the Orthodox, it is because of love towards something else, towards this world, what is
 in this world, lifestyle, way of thinking, way of living, some pagan philosophy, or some
 other comfort, it's not willingness to completely sacrifice yourself and take up your cross
 and follow Christ, that's where all these other heresies and other deviations come from.
 And of course this doesn't mean that the Orthodox people themselves don't deviate, all of them
 love Christ, no, unfortunately it's not the case, but at least in the Orthodox Church,
 the Church is telling them what is deviation and what is not deviation, while in those
 other groups it's completely away, it went astray and they don't have this self-healing
 mechanism which in the Orthodox Church is the Holy Eucharist, the communion, this is
 where we derive this true relationship with the Alive Christ who will rectify, who will
 change our false direction, our mistakes, and our worldliness, he will change us.
 So this is a miracle that happens, because for people it's impossible to reach.
 And to be honest, we ourselves we don't love Christ the way we should, if we are honest
 to ourselves.
 So what the Orthodoxy is bringing to us, we remember the Lord himself, he said in John
 14.21 "Whoever has my commandments and preserves them, keeps them, that one loves me."
 So if we have these commandments, we don't dilute it with some other things, we don't
 say, okay, adultery, well, it's not really adultery, no, adultery is adultery, "Whoever
 has a clean heart, he will see God."
 This is one of the commandments, one of the Beatitudes, and we fill ourselves with all
 kinds of garbage from this world, and we are attracted by that garbage coming from advertisement,
 from music, from everywhere, okay, no, if our heart is not clean, we will not see God.
 Blessed are those poor in spirit, not the people who can talk and they have their opinion
 about everything, about faith, about everything, well, there is no, it's not humble person,
 so we don't say that that is a virtue, okay, if it's not a virtue, it's not a virtue, okay,
 so this is me, that's what means that we have these commandments, as an Orthodox Church,
 we don't lose them, we don't dilute it, we don't pollute it with anything else, these
 are the commandments of the Lord that bring salvation, and also not just to have them,
 but also to keep them, to live like this, to live according to these commandments, which
 is impossible for humans to do, completely impossible, so by keeping them, we break away
 from this world, and we show our love towards Christ, we do have that love, whenever we
 keep these commandments and live with them, have this holy life of serving God, taking
 up our cross, sacrificing ourselves, and following him, being his weaknesses through how we live,
 through what is our inner world, okay, we read also in the Gospel of John 2.25, he says,
 and Jesus needed not that anyone should testify of a man, for he knew what was in a man, so
 the Lord knew, he saw directly what is in the heart, what spirit this man has in him,
 he knew it right away by just looking, maybe even no need to look, but this is what matters,
 what is in us, we are Orthodox not because we stick to some true dogmas, or because we
 are baptized Orthodox and we are automatically Orthodox, or because we wear some Orthodox
 clothing, or have Orthodox cross, or have something else, no, we are Orthodox if what
 is in us is, the Lord can see, it is love towards him, it is the holy temple of God,
 or at least we attempt to build it as much as possible, we put this the first priority
 in our life, we can see that, okay, I don't want to talk about these heresies, those who
 departed a long time ago from this path of salvation, these heresies, maybe inside there
 are some people who are still trying to find the truth, but overall these teachings, they
 are really wrong, the Catholicism, Protestantism, they went away, they don't want this way
 of the cross, they want to make him adjusted to this fallen self, to serve Mamona and not
 Jesus Christ, but now when we talk about the Orthodox Church itself, we need to see our
 own problems, not to make them, to get away from such things, so for example, Byzantine,
 it used to be the brightest light of faith to many nations, it was the great light coming
 out from Byzantine to all those barbaric people, and many of them received the true faith and
 follow Jesus Christ, but later, eventually, it departed away, we read Saint Gregory the
 Palamas in the 14th century, not long before the Byzantine was conquered by the Turks,
 he writes that this city, it used to be the city of God, used to be everybody had love
 among each other, serving the Lord, but what is it now?
 People are stealing from each other, fighting with each other, quarrelling and selfish,
 and it looks like enemies have invaded this city, they are plundering and fighting with
 each other, that's the perception that he had about Constantinople, and he himself was
 a citizen of that Byzantine, so this criticism comes from within, because he was a holy person,
 and he would see all these things, so very soon, Byzantine was destroyed, and we believe
 that the reason was this, that people lost love towards God and each other, and the Lord's
 grace and protection could not preserve upon that place any longer, and there is another
 testimony of a foreigner who came also to Constantinople in about the same time, 13th,
 14th century, and he writes that the only impression I have of this city is the immense
 worship of richness, of money, and this idolatry towards material things that the citizens
 of this place have.
 This is coming from a foreigner, he is not Orthodox yet, and he is saying that all those
 people who live there, they worship mammo, they worship this cow, golden cow, they only
 want to enrich themselves, to build better houses, to have nicer clothes, and stuff like
 that, is this the Orthodox capital?
 Not at all, formally it still was, but very soon it was destroyed by the Turks and became
 Muslim.
 So we can see that this worldliness we are not vaccinated against, we can also fall into
 it, the biggest problem we have in the Orthodox Church is that we have this close relationship
 with the government, and in the beginning it really was helpful, the pious kings and
 queens really wanted to develop the Church, to bring all nations to Christ, so they helped
 the Church as Christians, but now the government serves mammo, and our close relationship,
 we are still hoping to get something from the government, but it is using the Church
 for its own purpose, so it became like a shackles, any attachment to the government really is
 like a shackles to the Church of mammo, that is pulling the Church down and not allowing
 the Church to really have spiritual progress.
 So this is one of the problems we still have unfortunately.
 Or another problem is this rhetoric that everybody is Orthodox, or if you are Russian you are
 Orthodox, you have to be Orthodox, if you are Greek you have to be Orthodox, Romanian
 all of that, Romanian means Orthodox, this also is the result of this, becomes that Orthodox
 becomes almost like a swear word, because people look at this secular and pagan behavior
 of these people who are supposedly Orthodox, and they say "oh now we know what's Orthodox,
 and now we understand, these are those corrupt and filthy and greedy and without any ethics,
 without any... oh that's Orthodox, now we know what's Orthodox", so it becomes a great shame.
 So the Church really needs to distinguish, any nation has nothing to do with the Orthodox,
 if you want to be Orthodox you need to enter into this new world, into this new realm,
 and everything else remains outside, and this world can go anywhere, according to a great
 reset, according to some plans, according to whatever plans, it can go anywhere it wants,
 but the Church has to remain the Church, and we are not dragged to follow somebody else's
 agenda, some government or some international body or whatever, we remain loyal to Christ
 and we cut these ties to the world, we cut our attachment to this fallen world.
 So we need to break away these shackles.
 And also the Orthodoxy very often comes in a "boutaphoric" form, very nominal form, so
 for example we have nice photos, priest in some vestment, in some church, or some rituals,
 also many priests standing there, and there is this ritual going on, "Oh, this is Orthodox,
 or that priest that has this, this is Orthodox", no, this is nothing, this is a model, this
 is cosplay, Hollywood, this is nothing, it has nothing to do with the true faith, yes,
 the Church has some forms, but this is not what makes it Orthodox, what makes it Orthodox
 is if we are with the Lord, if our heart is open to Him, you need to be like children,
 the Lord said, if your heart is like a heart of child, embracing the grace, that's Orthodox.
 Not some theologian who has big glasses and all those books and he, "Oh, I'm Orthodox
 because I read so many Holy Fathers and I read so many articles", no.
 And it's not some analysts who analyze everything and speak about everything, they don't get
 the truth, no matter how well you're educated, the truth is simple, you need to be like baby,
 you need to be with open heart, open mind to perceive the truth.
 And if you're like this Talmudic approach, you will never get the truth, it will be just
 slipping away from you.
 So this, this is this "Buddhaphoric Orthodoxy" that some people are obsessed about, there
 is other types of Orthodoxy, we have this Orthodoxy or death, some people like paramilitary,
 they have these black shirts and they are so powerful and angry, we're gonna kill you
 no matter what you do, Orthodoxy or death, so they're ready to kill you, that's what
 means death.
 This has nothing to do with Orthodoxy, with faith, with love, following Christ, taking
 up your cross, this is very strange and these people possess themselves as the frontier
 of Orthodoxy, and sometimes Orthodoxy comes with some titles, great and most holy and
 highest and holiness, whatever, whatever, whatever, all those titles coming, this was
 also not Orthodox, Orthodoxy is not about that, this is all some built up, we remember
 the revolution in Russia, just everything just swept away, right away, just swept away,
 all those nice cathedrals, closers and many other things, so now the agenda of this world
 is willing to destroy whatever remains of true Christianity, and if we don't understand
 ourselves what is the essence of our faith, what we are ready to die for, we're not ready
 to die for vestments or some other things, no, but we are ready to die for Christ, if
 we don't understand this, we will be just swept away or misguided, misled and will worship
 this indomitable creature that will declare himself to be like God, receive his kingdom
 and whatever else, so let us be like these children, let us always search for the Lord,
 the Lord wants us not just to understand oh now I get Orthodoxy is this, I read this,
 this, this, okay now I know, now okay this is Orthodox, no, Orthodoxy is like coming
 into a room, into a palace and staying there and it's a new life, a new place, a new reality
 and this is where we want to be all the time, this is what it means to get into the church,
 to become Orthodox, that every day for us the main task becomes to search for Jesus
 Christ, we always think about him, we always try to find his truth in whatever happens,
 whatever we know, for us this becomes the content of our life and our mind, our heart,
 Jesus Christ, his commandments, do I love them, do they bring salvation, do I draw life
 from them, my whole heart is seeking for him, I want to be in this net, he said, it will
 be like fish caught in the net, I want to be in that net, I don't want to slip through
 and then go, I want to be in that net, that means I don't want to follow my will, I want
 to follow the Lord's will, which may bring suffering, which may bring self-humiliation
 other things, but I am willing to take this, take up my cross and follow him, because otherwise
 we are remaining awake outside of his providence, of his care, he will not be with us, he will
 not be helping us and taking care of us if we don't want this ourselves, we will be just
 outside just browsing around and that's gonna be our useless life, let us ask the Lord to
 give us such heart, that we love him and to keep us on this path, to help us remain true,
 loyal to him, truly orthodox, with a true love towards God, because we don't love him,
 we need to understand, we want to learn to start loving him from our full heart, I mean,
 may the Lord help us on this path, give us his blessing, I mean.
