 Dear brothers and sisters, in the past I have recorded some videos about spiritual
 implications of artificial intelligence and digitalization. Today I want to say a few words
 about ChatGPT and all these chants, you know, like Alexa or Athena, which become more and more
 popular. And how does this pose a threat to our relationship with the Lord? Well,
 we need to think about why God is the Word, okay, because
 Logos in Greek became human, okay, and we are talking now about baptism of Christ and this
 manifestation of God during these days, His coming and His manifestation. This manifestation
 comes through speech, through Word. Of course, the term Word or the Holy Word, Divine Word, is wider
 than just speech, okay, it includes the acts of the Lord, it includes us partaking of Him physically
 through Holy Communion, but still the Word and speech are central because He is called the Word,
 okay. In the beginning was the Word, okay, so this and this also makes humans different from other
 animals that we speak, okay. So now we are facing new reality that people begin to speak directly
 with artificial intelligence. It's not similar as you just google something, you write some search
 and you find address or whatever. This brings this up to the next level,
 okay. Now this communication becomes for many people a source of inspiration, okay. Just recently
 some Japanese writer, she wrote that Chad GPT inspired her, okay, in her writing, and of course
 she was awarded some awards, okay, literary awards, okay, because this world is trying to
 propagate, okay, this stuff, okay, to make it popular, to make it, you know,
 used by everyone. Inspiration has to come from the Lord, okay, not from
 Chad GPT, okay. So this is just an example, okay. There are tons of other examples. There is example
 when some boyfriend, he didn't know what to say to his girlfriend, and he was using Chad GPT to
 sort of help him in this communication, and then she was amazed and she thought,
 oh, he's so interesting and exciting, because Chad GPT knew what she liked and what she wanted,
 okay, and found tons of information, okay, to make it interesting and exciting to communicate. So
 he was much stronger and better in what? In acting as a beloved one, okay, someone who loves you or
 who at least has some sympathy to you than this guy human, okay, and there are many other examples,
 okay. When Chad GPT is providing some counseling, well, providing some entertainment, okay,
 providing media to access something, some scope of knowledge or some group of people,
 some career, okay, something, it becomes the some guide and intermediary who is linking you with
 something, and this, okay, he provides some images to you, even some videos to you, okay,
 he is a creator, he creates some content for you, okay, he becomes your conscience,
 okay, because he would advise you what is right, what is wrong, who is good, who is bad, and stuff
 like that, and he is very polite in doing that, okay, so that he really attracts people through
 that kind of politeness, and what does this sound like to you? To me this sounds like God,
 or at least some, okay, saint, okay, who can give you some counseling, okay,
 but more than saint, because saint would not replace God, he would lead you to God,
 but Chad GPT doesn't lead you to God, okay, and this paves a way to this religious union
 with that, with whatever is behind those algorithms which are behind the Chad GPT,
 and people don't really understand any danger or any implication of that.
 In the Bible we find many instances when we're told that whoever we're uniting with
 will become like that, so Apostle Paul is advising us, okay, that,
 well, first of course he says that whoever is baptized into Christ has put on Christ,
 this is this union singularity with Christ, but also he brings the Holy Communion, Holy Eucharist,
 of course, that also brings someone, but also he is speaking about uniting and becoming one body
 with what? For example with a whore, okay, and with all this impurity and all the other whores,
 okay, that makes you one body with all that filthiness, okay, and another big example is
 union with idols, okay, communication with idols and with the demons who are behind those idols,
 making you one, okay, making you drink, he says, drink the cup of devil, okay,
 and we find in the Psalms, well, Apostle Paul, he also says in 1 Corinthians that
 bad companies corrupt virtuous customs or virtuous
 personalities, okay, let's translate it like that, so if you communicate with some bad people
 in some bad company you will become like that, and we find it in the Psalms, we find that
 with the righteous you will be like, you will be righteous, and with the
 with the corrupt one you will be corrupt, and also in the Psalms we find that
 those who worship idols will be like idols themselves, to us this is not
 not intuitive, okay, well, you worship this, you worship that, so what? No, whatever you worship
 that's what you become, okay, you worship an idol, you will become like an idol yourself,
 dumb, stubborn, and so on, okay, like a piece of wood, okay, and similar things happen
 in our daily life, okay, your communication with your spouse will change your attitude, will change
 your personality, okay, it's mutual, okay, your involvement in some profession, okay, say
 in the military, you will become, okay, influenced by that, your studies abroad in another country,
 in using another language, okay, will make you different, you come back, people will see that
 you're different than others, okay, how? Okay, you say, oh, I've studied somewhere, now we understand
 why you're different from all the rest, okay, these examples, they tell us a lot, okay, they
 tell us that it's not me, that I am myself, no matter whom I communicate with, where I go, I just,
 okay, just learn more, I just know better, but me is me, okay, this is blindness, okay, this is blindness
 when we don't notice how these, okay, communications are changing us, reshaping us, reprogramming us, if
 you will, that happens with any kind of addiction, okay, digital addiction, be it gaming addiction,
 okay, any movie addiction, okay, any kind of addiction like that will change your personality,
 okay, which groups are you in Telegram or in Facebook, okay, if you go there often, it doesn't
 happen overnight, okay, but quite fast, okay, this happens quite fast, and all these digital addictions
 will come, will boil down to one addiction, the AI addiction, okay, eventually everything is going to
 be AI, not only in your smartphone, but only also in your car, in your house, in your work environment,
 like everywhere is going to be some sort of chat GPT, okay, and basically you might say
 God is much bigger, much stronger than all those things, if I am baptized, if I am Christian,
 why do I need to care about all these things influencing me? Well, don't be so self-confident,
 okay, and don't say oh my confidence is based on Christ, now I could tell you like practically
 speaking, most of the faithful who are baptized and who come to church, not the ones which are
 okay on their own, the guys, the people who come to church, who try to okay be active about their faith,
 even they are influenced so much by their background, culture, way of life, attachment to this
 material world, okay, their social status, their work, their family, okay, all these things, they
 matter so much, some people they cannot find time, some of the faithful cannot even find time to open
 the holy scripture or to find an icon and put in a nice place, they don't find time, they consider
 themselves active orthodox Christians, but they find time for anything, but for some very
 small basic things of faith, they could not find time, okay, what does this mean? This means that
 this reality, this mode of existence in this world, this being immersed in this world
 matters much more to many people than their faith in Christ, and that means that if this
 chat-gpt thing is going to be omnipresent, okay, it's going to be everywhere, okay, and everybody
 is going to be using it, this will matter much more practically speaking for people including
 the faithful, and people will be made by the image of what is implied in there, and be sure that it's
 not going to be some Christian value, okay, and like this union with machines in industrial
 revolution, okay, where humans and machines mass production came together creating some form of
 automaton, some new reality, human, a machine reality, this shaped society of modernity,
 okay, this influenced the way people think, the way people interact, everything, the same thing,
 but on a much more profound deep level is going to happen when everyone embraces this AI thing.
 So what is the solution? The solution is we need to know the limitations, the dangers of this thing,
 we need to look back on ourselves. If I'm using something too much, I have reliance,
 this influences my mood, my way of treating my relatives, my way of life, this is a good
 indication that it's time to either limit or stop this thing altogether, okay, so please I urge
 everyone to be careful, it's not that we have to refuse all technology, go back to caves or to
 somewhere and live without anything, without electricity, in a forest or something, no,
 but we have to be masters of what's going on and not the other way around, okay, where is this
 boundary? Well, the Lord is out there and he can tell you if we pray enough, if we go, if we live
 spiritual life, we will gain the wisdom of where to stop and what to do and what to avoid.
 May the Lord who came into this world, who spoke to the mankind, be always with us, may our
 communication be with him first and foremost and not with something else, okay, not with
 something else, not with some artificial intelligence, all of that is, okay, myself I
 don't like to use it, okay, be honest, okay, not even for fun, okay, I don't want to have
 anything in common with that thing, for me just to use some search engine is good enough to search
 for some pictures is good enough, I don't need to ask AI to make some pictures, some movies,
 some music for me, I don't need that, okay, I can do without it and it's up to you to decide
 where is your limitation, but for me this is a limitation, I consider that there is nothing
 coming from there that really helps me, okay, that really helps mission, helps anything,
 so I can do without it just fine, okay, up to now. May the Lord give you wisdom, give you strength,
 give you joy of his coming to this world and give us victory over all these dangers and threats
 that are coming and that are being, that are getting bigger and bigger, I mean. God bless.
