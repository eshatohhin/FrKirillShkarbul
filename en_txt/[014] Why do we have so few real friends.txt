 Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about friendship and why is it so
 difficult for us to make friends, to have new friends and most of us have maybe one or two
 friends the most. Many people don't have any friends at all. If you have more real friends
 that's some amazing blessing because even one friend is a precious gift from God and we need
 to preserve them as much as we can. Most of the friends we have are from childhood or from some
 college years, university years. Very rarely do we have real good friends from later time of our life
 and there are several reasons for that. Today we're going to talk about this and why and how
 is it related to our faith. Well, one important reason is that we as we grow we have this false
 perception of self-importance. I am self, I am very important myself and this is why I don't
 if somebody doesn't recognize this importance I don't want to communicate with him and the friend
 would know your weaknesses, he would know you're all through and you would not be able to stress
 your image the way you want to present it to everybody that everybody thinks oh this is some
 great phenomenon or some successful person. The friend would know about all things and that
 many ways you're not that successful and many other things a real friend would know.
 We don't want anyone to know and this is why we don't allow people into our life. We have all
 those barriers and we install more and more of those barriers. Also another reason is that as we
 grow older we have more we accumulate more assets not necessarily property but maybe properties also
 we in I mean real estate cars and stuff but also we accumulate diplomas we work experience we
 accumulate some career development that we have and many other things and we perceive it as a big
 self this is big me okay and this is my property my asset it belongs to me and I don't want to
 share it with anyone else. If somebody is my friend I really he's like I'm letting him into
 my house to use whatever I have here for his own purposes and we don't want that. We become very
 stingy and very much attached to all that stuff and think that this is mine even though we don't
 take it anywhere after we die but we still have that false impression false perception that this
 is my stuff and I'm afraid to lose it and to share it with anyone. It's like giving it freely away but
 it's being accumulated with a lot of labor a lot of suffering and this this is my thing. We can see
 how how far this mindset is from Christ's commandments but we still are like that all of us.
 Another reason is that we begin to value personal benefit okay if somebody can benefit me
 okay I will use them. I will accept that thing but I will help anyone else with the aim that he would
 give some benefit to me. So for example some people they know they have they say okay all my neighbors
 are my friends this is basically because you help them that they can help you out also or they don't
 create problems for you and this is why you're sort of friends with them but it's not real
 friendship this is just convenience this is just some mutual benefit maybe partnership something
 like that sometimes we think that okay my person with whom I play tennis say or golf or something
 else is my friend okay but he's not really your friend you're both friends with the tennis maybe
 or golf or some other hobby but it's not friendship between between two of you because it's friendship
 with something else mainly and for you it's just convenience okay so we need not to fool ourselves
 to tell us that this is some kind of friendship it might grow into a friendship but most of the time
 it doesn't. Another big reason why this happens is because with time we have more and more negative
 experience with people okay some people betray us other people use us cheat
 and we know that anyone we can expect that from anyone okay and that's why we become more critical
 more cautious with people we keep distance with them not to make them able to harm us too much
 okay so this is why we don't accept people too close into my home into my heart okay that's
 another big problem we are more afraid we're not that naive anymore we are suspicious and all of
 that those qualities are also what christ is against okay he's saying be like babies okay
 like children maybe pure and simple and open your hearts don't worry that much if god is with you
 even if somebody harms you betrays you say well this this suffering will make you stronger this
 will bring you closer to christ you will suffer in the same way as christ suffered okay so don't
 always be that conservative that that much afraid and suspicious of everyone okay be reasonable okay
 of course we need to be reasonable but that doesn't have to become some kind of fear or
 some kind of suspecting everybody of everything okay of something okay so we don't we're not
 afraid of risk we're not afraid of problems of burden okay we can also some people think well
 somebody becomes my friend he will bring his own problems into my life okay i have enough of my
 own problems but then i would have to also help him with his problems and okay i it's just too
 much i have enough troubles in my life and i don't want anybody else's troubles to become my troubles
 okay so that's another thing we're becoming more becoming more selfish more self-oriented and we
 have our own like a castle that we close uh you know and this is similar to what i've said in the
 previous video about keys from the kingdom of heaven that all kinds of sins are entering into
 human heart and it's closing its gates its doors from inside and not letting anyone in
 so with christ we are able to be healthy and strong and not so easy to be hurt or to be
 uh to be damaged by somebody and we can uh withstand all kinds of
 sufferings and hurt that might happen okay we are walking on the waters we're not trying to
 uh okay get ourselves insured against all kinds of troubles okay so this is what faith can give us
 another big reason why this happens is that with the time we become more
 self-confident in in terms of i already know everything okay i'm not interesting to interested
 of learning something from somebody else okay some of his experience i have my own experience
 i have my own judgment i i basically i know of everything okay i'm curious only if somebody has
 done something bad or some some things uh happened in the news but i'm not interested in serious
 stuff i if you tell me to read some classics or some uh important valuable uh stuff well we think
 okay i know everything about it it's it's uh i don't need it okay it's it's it's not relevant
 to me anymore okay now this is another consequence of of us living without god okay and our mindset
 becomes more and more narrow okay we become only concerned with uh okay what we see right now in
 front of us okay and we don't want to have that because uh any friendship relationship becomes
 like a small church we're gonna say it's like a small church where it's a school that we learn
 from each other we really learn from each other's experience and we also bear each other's burdens
 okay we participate we have compassion for each other we participate we share enjoy in sorrow we
 share that so it is actually a christian virtue to have a real friendship with someone and
 friendship is also also always a sacrifice okay we sacrifice our heart our time for someone else
 and now the modern people they they don't need uh they don't want to sacrifice okay they want to
 gain to receive okay and not to give okay so this is another big problem in christ only him
 he can really make us different okay he can really change this in us because uh ourselves
 we are like that okay and we get worse and worse um and we become very selfish in a way that
 if somebody else wants something to be done differently for no i want it to be my way okay
 i i want to do what i want okay and this is also why we have that lack of friendship and this is
 also why families break up because husband and wife they should be real friends should become
 real friends but without christian blessing and christ in us healing us and guarding us from this
 spirit of the world and from our own fallen fallen nature uh is absent is absent from people's lives
 and we don't let him in okay and um it is only lord who can help us we have fixed ideas okay
 we don't want to receive others ideas including political okay this is i the way i i see it
 and in everything else we become more and more okay narrow okay narrow-minded we think that this
 is free that we are but in in reality we become slaves of our own of our own nature mindset and
 we become stupid we think we're smart but we're not so it is with christ that we gain real wisdom
 and this broadness of mind and freedom of in spirit okay and we can see wisdom in everybody's
 position we can learn much more stuff we can a child be like children says lord and the child
 is always learning he's always interested to grasp something else and this is how we should be even
 though we're we've grown up but we're still we can be like that with the grace and blessing of god
 okay uh so let us not be afraid of the responsibilities that a real friendship has
 let us ask christ to open our hearts which are closed and sealed and glued okay let him break
 this thing and make us not be afraid of anything of stepping out and a way of faith is walking on
 the waters and we are ready to walk on the waters and be open to others and receive them into our
 life into our heart and to participate in their lives mainly for helping them and supporting them
 okay so may god bless us give us this heart this loving christian heart
 despite age despite our experience despite our past experience we forgive everyone everything
 we forget about it we don't have any grudges about our life about others and we become
 more and more open and friendly and supportive of people around us and you will see that
 there will be other people like that and that we will have real friends and even if we don't
 because christ himself he came to his own people but they did not receive but it still was worth
 coming okay it's not a failure so if we don't get anything back we we're not expecting it okay we're
 not being upset and being discouraged okay and may christ give us this heart give us his blessing
 and give us his mind i mean god bless
