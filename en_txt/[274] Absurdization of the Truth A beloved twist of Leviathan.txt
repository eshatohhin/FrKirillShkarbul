 Dear brothers and sisters, my second last video was about fake traditionalisms, and
 today I want to say about something which is applied to modern world and this is a big
 issue right now, okay?
 Almost any news that you hear now is related to that, and we will look at it from the biblical
 point of view using the concept of "Leviathan".
 There were videos also about "Leviathan" that I have made which you could go back to, okay,
 but in a nutshell "Leviathan" is this cooperation between devil, this spirit, evil spirit, or
 Satan who is against God, and people and systems, okay, which are in place, be it governments,
 be it some organizations, be it social norms, be it whatever, that suit the purposes of
 this evil spirit.
 Okay, so this is seen both on individual and on institutional and social level, okay?
 This could sound as a very abstract idea but this is something which is out there, okay?
 This is, if you will, the world that we read about in the ascetic literature, this is the
 this evil force which is the darkness of this world.
 This is what Apostle Paul was saying, that we are, our fight is against these principalities
 of darkness, not against flesh and blood.
 So it's more spiritual than physical but eventually it also has its physical component, okay?
 So "Leviathan" is inspired by devil, okay, and devil is pictured as a snake in the Holy
 Scripture because it's twisting, okay, binding, and he's not moving straight, okay?
 So you cannot really say it's here or it's there because it's always winding back and
 forth, okay, trying to escape the truth.
 There is no truth in the devil, he is the liar and the father of all lies.
 So whenever there is some agenda that the devil is pushing through, he will also have
 something opposing, seemingly opposing this agenda so that he can switch back and forth anytime.
 This is why the Marxists and socialists, they love this idea of dialectics, materialistic
 or historical dialectics which come from, of course, from Hegel and from Kabbalah and
 from this idea of this winding snake, Uroboros, if you will, all those things are related.
 So to make it more simple, okay, we can say that there is outright evil which is now being
 propagated mainly through this ultra-liberal and post-Christian values and it's being imposed
 on all societies, okay, wherever they could do it easily, and they know that not everybody
 will agree.
 In some countries the reaction to these things is weak and therefore on the country level
 that agenda was eventually accomplished, including Taiwan for example.
 In 2019 the sodomite couples gained legal approval.
 And this is just the tip of the iceberg, this is just, it's not all about sodomites, okay,
 there is the whole big agenda against gender, against the family, okay, advancing all kinds
 of satanic stuff, re-abortion, euthanasia, many, many other things, okay, it all boils
 down to it's right what they say is right and not what the Bible or your conscience
 tells you, okay, so there is no sin if they say there is no sin, okay, so all kinds of
 immoral life is okay if it's legal, if it's allowed by them, okay, and they tell you basically,
 they shape your mind, your conscience, and it all becomes very unchristian, very hedonistic,
 it could take different shapes and forms, okay, let's leave it there for now.
 So they know that not everybody is going to be supportive, so what do they do with that?
 Well first, you know, every one of us, when we encounter someone who does not live by
 Christian faith, who has some, you know, postmodernist values or, you know, like secular and so-called
 progressive mindset, you would tell them anything about chastity or about, say, Christian family
 values or you will tell them something about Christian education of children or Christian
 role of woman, they will twist it in a way that to sound, so that you would sound so absurd
 and you would be a clown, okay, they will tell you, okay, you're against, you believe
 in some old guy in the sky who created everything and just by, you know, in a second, so you
 believe what?
 That there is no science, you're against evolution, you're against everything, maybe you believe
 that the earth is flat, maybe, I don't know, so they would really make you sound stupid
 and make you feel like a fool, especially if it's in front of someone else.
 Or against women, okay, or like a very good example, if you were not supportive of all those procedures,
 you know, that they were making three years ago and you had doubts about, okay, why we
 have to and stuff like that or about these things that everybody has to wear, then they
 would say, you're against life, you are looted, you are, I don't know, enemy of the society,
 you are, I don't know, you came from caves or something, you don't believe in science,
 you don't believe in progress, we are saving humanity and, okay, and it sounds super persuasive
 because all the media, everything is, that's what they are, they were imposing, they were
 brainwashing people, and those examples are basically more on individual level, okay,
 so just to give you a feel of what I'm talking about, but on the whole world level, what
 is going on now, okay, now there is a big, big twist of Leviathan, and what is this twist
 all about?
 This big twist is about getting rid of some basic moral values or anything that is still
 left of Christian faith and morality to swipe that away, and to swipe that away for good,
 okay, and not on individual level, if there are some individuals, he can tolerate that,
 okay, that's not a big danger for him, but if this is still influential, if there is
 some group or country where majority of people have something like that, which doesn't fit
 his plans, okay, he needs to do something about it, so now what he is doing by splitting
 the whole world, he is trying to do that, okay, so how does he do that?
 He is radicalizing two things, one is radicalizing this liberal agenda, making it look very agressive,
 ugly, very pushy, aggressive, like we saw in the opening of Olympia in Paris, which
 was a blasphemy against Christianity, against all basic moral values, and on the other hand
 he says, okay, you don't want that? Come here. Where? You know where, right? All these rightists,
 be it in Russia, be it in some parties in Europe or in so-called global south, be it
 China, okay, which supposedly is left, but now it seems more like right, well, all of
 those things he can play around with, so what does he do? He tells you, okay, you value
 what? You value family, traditional values, faith, you're anti-acumenist, come here, okay,
 we will protect you, we will push your values, okay, but we will add something else to it,
 like what? Like war, you will have to go to war if you want to protect us, or like fascism,
 you will have to accept the fascist dictatorship or something like that, okay, just that, okay,
 so you either go there or you come here with us, okay, and they will make it so ugly that
 everybody will be against, eventually, people, it will not survive in their plan what they
 hope to achieve. This is similar to what happened in Germany, okay, in Germany, before the Second
 World War, there were traditional values, there were stronger families, there was culture,
 there was German ideals, spirit, and things like that, so that was used by whom? Well,
 by the devil, okay, but Hitler just happened to be his instrument, okay, and all this group,
 okay, which came, actually, the coming to power of Hitler was through sodomites, okay,
 but this is historical things, they actually had those riots and, you know, it was basically
 getting rid of anyone who was against them with those storm squads, okay, headed by general
 Rome, okay, and they were basically all sodomites, you can research this story, but that's not
 the main thing, the main thing that they came as though they are bringing the true values,
 okay, before that they were, they said, okay, you see, now the German nation is being perverted,
 we have all that capitalism, all that people are just searching for some gains, they are
 just trading, and they are so lowly, so earthly, we give you some ideals, we give you the future
 of German nation, we give you, we are neo-gods, we are like neo-gods, the whole rife, okay,
 it's coming, it's thousand year rife, it will be so great, and we are so inspired and ideological,
 and many people, they believe, they thought this is the future, these guys are heroes,
 okay, it's not like those, I don't know, banksters, they are just using financial things, they
 are just exploiting people and so forth, so people believed and say yes, and then it came
 to what?
 It came to this massive war, to Holocaust, okay, which is another story, killing so many
 people, not only Jews, but also gypsies and Poles and many nations, and they said this
 is what you wanted, and the whole world was frightened when they saw what monster came
 out of this, and what happened later, and later when Hitler was destroyed, the German
 nation basically also was destroyed, they were reprogrammed, they were brainwashed,
 and they became unable to have any culture, any strong morals, okay, it was all ruined,
 they had to accept this new world order, this liberal and cosmopolitan and basically capitalistic,
 earthly, hedonistic values, and merged in this western post-Christian Libya fund.
 So similar things would be achieved if their plan will work, okay, they want to radicalize
 all those who are against this liberal agenda, and now it's not just Germany, now it's the
 whole world, okay, and not just Russia of course, it's the whole world, whoever is still
 against these values and this stuff, okay, come here, okay, we will fight, we will be
 against it, and then eventually it will become so ugly, it will become the fastest, it will
 become like a really ugly monster, that then no one will want to have to do anything with
 that, okay, and it will be all processed, and it will be part of the new world order
 that they want to build, which is not necessarily will be like this liberal and capitalist and
 whatnot, okay, it will be something else, it will be basically this apollyon, this spirit
 will be the god for all, this is what they want, okay, that people all listen to him,
 what he says that's true, what he says that's value, okay, and there will be no more, some
 strong convictions and beliefs which have anything to do with Christianity, and with
 Islam also, okay, all the Muslim world will be also ruined, but for them it's already
 marginalized, okay, so Islam and all this Muslim stuff, basically it's marginalized,
 it's a local thing, so even though it's quite numerous, but it's not, it doesn't have that
 potential to influence all the world, okay, so basically this is what's going on right
 now, and today I don't want to talk about politics or geopolitics, about war, I just
 want all of you to keep in mind, okay, that Leviathan, he is wise, and Antichrist is called
 the genius of geniuses, and we should be detached from any propaganda, from any manipulation,
 from any way of involving us into some movements and things like this, okay, they will try
 to stir up our emotions, that we feel, oh, we have to be there, or we have to fight,
 or we have to go somewhere to do, okay, the greatest thing that we can do is to improve
 our spiritual life, and if we can save someone's life, okay, we do that, okay, but not to be
 part of this game, okay, this deadly game of Apollyon, who wants to destroy human souls
 and human bodies, may the Lord give us wisdom, may he give us peace in our hearts, that we
 don't get too much distressed about what's going on, he's not God, okay, he's trying
 to do his thing, but we are given, every day that we are given is a great treasure, that
 we can still use this day, and every day that we can use, this is, if we use it in the right
 way, we don't fall into passion scenes, we bring the testimony of Christian love, and
 we spoil the plans of all these evil forces that are out there, and the greater the darkness
 is, the greater achievements each and every one of us can have, and those would be pleasing
 to the Lord and would bring great benefit, spiritual benefit to us and to people around
 us and maybe to people far away from us, may the Lord strengthen our prayer, give us wisdom,
 give us strength, and preserve us in every tribulation, deception, and temptation.
 God bless, brothers and sisters.
