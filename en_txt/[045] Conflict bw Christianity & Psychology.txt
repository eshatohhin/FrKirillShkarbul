 Dear brothers and sisters, today we're not in Las Vegas, we're still in our church,
 but it is the last video in this year's Christmas season, so we want to say farewell to this year's
 Christmas, and today I want to talk about a topic that is related to Christmas, because we've
 prepared for Christmas for quite a while, for 40 days event period, and this preparation had the
 aim, the goal of making our heart ready for receiving the newly born Christ, for receiving
 Christ in our life, which is really difficult, which is really not that straightforward,
 not that easy, and we see from the situation in the world, the spiritual situation is not good,
 people are not strong in faith, even those who believe in Christ and follow, try to follow him,
 find that it's difficult to change, and we always stumble and have similar problems over and over,
 and when we look at ancient saints and martyrs, we are really surprised how they were able to reach
 such a high level spirituality, and one of the reasons why this is so has to do with
 modern psychology, and the mindset which is received by everyone, okay, and this
 is not to completely discard psychology or say that it's useless and harmful, no, there are many
 important and valuable things in psychology and we need to do all those studies and research into
 human personality and behavior and many other things, this is important, however, one of the
 fundamental sort of frameworks of psychology is false, and we are all influenced by this framework,
 this today is not some scientific discourse, this has to do with every one of us,
 and you will discover that this is deep in every one of us, okay, and we need to change it.
 Okay, what am I talking about? I'm talking about the basic postulate of psychology, that
 if all the problems you have in family life, in personal comfort, in your career
 development, in everything, has to do with your self-belief or non-belief, okay, you need to
 be sure that you are the best, okay, and you are able to do many things and achieve goals,
 and you are very important, and if you don't believe this, nobody is going to believe that,
 so you have to proclaim to everyone that you are important and you need to get that place
 and you are there and everybody is gonna be, okay, seeing that you're a leader and you can
 do something and stuff like that, and if you're not like that, okay, then you are loser, okay,
 you don't believe in yourself, you're weak, you have all kinds of fears, you have
 lack of self-esteem, you have problems building relationships, you have these
 all kinds of stress and despair and all kinds of problems, okay, because you're lacking
 self-confidence and self-esteem, okay, so there are two states, it's either that or this,
 okay, or somewhere in the middle, but you have to choose one, okay, it has to be that one, okay, so
 if you have that, you have everything, okay, so this is like an entrance into life,
 okay, into happy life, and you will see that we believe that, okay, this is not somebody
 just teaching this in schools, we believe that, this is deep in us, okay, and Christ is telling us
 something else, because the first beatitude, okay, is blessed are the poor in spirit,
 blessed are the poor in spirit, and who are the poor in spirit, the poor in spirit are those who
 don't have their own spirit, who don't say I'm John Smith, I'm whatever, I'm someone, okay,
 I'm personality, this is my style, okay, I impose my values, my attitude, my character
 upon everybody, everybody can feel that, we can feel that somebody has walked into the room,
 we feel his spirit or her spirit, this is my spirit, I am someone, okay, I have my experience,
 I have my resume, okay, it says how special I am, I know this, I know that, I've studied
 somewhere, and I'm a master, I'm a doctor, I'm whatever, and this is the spirit that is
 filling us, fulfilling our heart, and this makes it impossible for us to be Christians,
 okay, because blessed are the poor in spirit, and this is the first beatitude, which means
 that it is conditioned for everything else, you don't have this, you don't have humble heart,
 you cannot have anything else in terms of spiritual gifts and progress in following Christ,
 so this is in direct contradiction with what the modern psychology is telling us, okay,
 and so the issue for us is not to be like self-confident or lack of self-confidence,
 we don't care about these problems, these are fake problems, okay, fake issues,
 for us we are with God or not, and we forget about ourselves when we are with God,
 okay, we don't care how glorious we are and how many people know that my name is this and I have
 done some achievements and things like that, we don't care about that at all, we care about
 following Christ and glorifying Christ and understanding his will and doing this will,
 like the soldier who has no time to make selfies, okay, when he is in the war he cares about
 doing what he's told, the commands, what he's told and to do it as good as he can, as fast as he can,
 so that the whole army can advance, otherwise he will be killed, if he has his own ideas, if he
 has a time to make some selfies and stuff like that, he will be killed right away, okay, so this
 is what is preventing us from being true Christians, okay, and we can make some comparison,
 okay, for example, this secular psychology telling us, okay, take fast something for yourself,
 okay, if you see some opportunity grasp it, okay, you need to seize that opportunity, catch it,
 okay, the Lord tells us give yourself, sacrifice yourself to others, the secular psychology tells
 us be first, okay, if you line up be first there, okay, you have to be first on some,
 okay, in the school you have to be best, okay, in your resume you have to have some things which are
 making you better than others, okay, you need to be first, take first seat, okay,
 and the Lord tells us, okay, be last and last will be first and first will be last and whoever
 makes himself low he will be raised high and whoever wants to be high he will be
 humbled, he will be brought down, okay, so this is not glorify yourself, this is the secular
 Italians, okay, make a good promotion, market yourself, sell yourself well, get a good price,
 okay, and the Lord is telling us glorify God, take the last place and put yourself low,
 so it's completely different, okay, it's the opposite, okay, the secular tells us be aggressive,
 be aggressive and put a lot of, okay, it's like war, life is like war, you need to win your
 bread and other things, okay, and the Lord is telling, be merciful, others want to catch
 something, let them get it, have it, you will not lose, with the Lord you will never lose, okay,
 you will gain things much more important and, okay, the secular tells us believe in yourself,
 you can do it, okay, you are able to do it and the Lord is telling us that
 you are fallen, okay, you have this in you, cannot trust yourself, trust in God, rely on him,
 he is your savior, without him you cannot do anything, this is what the Lord is telling us,
 the secular tells us build like a bastion, like a castle, okay, you need to have insurance, you have
 good relationships, good connections that will secure you, you have to have status and all kinds
 of things and a lot of money in your bank account, okay, and or gold and store it somewhere and the
 Lord is telling us, collect treasures in the heavens, okay, that's where your treasures are,
 don't care about this earthly stuff, okay, you will have as much as you need,
 don't worry too much about it,
 the secular tells time is money, don't waste your time, okay, somebody is wasting your time,
 you need to do something about it, okay, the Lord is telling us sacrifice yourself, your time,
 your everything for others, for serving the Lord, the secular tells my own goals are the most
 important, you need to be clear what's your goals, what's your objective, you need to reach that
 objective, what is your benefit, and the Lord tells us, okay, know the will of God and do the will of God,
 don't care about yourself, your own benefit, your own benefits, goals, objectives,
 understand what I want, okay, tells the Lord and do that, okay, so we see this difference,
 okay, it's, it's, there is a sharp contrast between these two things and both tell us that this is
 something that is in the, okay, essential in the very beginning, without it you have nothing,
 okay, we see this anti-Christian nature of this psychology, it's completely different from the
 Lord's message, and you may agree with me, okay, that, okay, yes, we choose what the Lord tells us,
 which we want to be with the Lord, but you will discover, if you're honest with yourself, that
 even though I agree to those values, my heart is still like that, when it comes to, okay,
 get the first, get something first, you will get it, I will get it, okay, we, we are like deeply,
 we are still in that paradigm, okay, and when, okay, somebody is gonna glorify you, promote you,
 you will say yes, yes, yes, of course, yes, please put me in the first lines, okay, and many other
 examples, okay, you, you will discover that somewhere deep in our hearts we are still that,
 okay, old man, so if we really want to have Christ come into our hearts, change us, make our life
 blessed and full of Christian joy, and if we want to inherit the kingdom of heaven,
 we have to have this deep, profound change in us, in our very souls, very deep in our souls,
 may the Lord help us, give us this blessing, give us His wisdom and love to change and to follow Him
 every day of our life. Merry Christmas.
