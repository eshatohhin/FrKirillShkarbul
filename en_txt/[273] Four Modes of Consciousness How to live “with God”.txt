 Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about spiritual life, about
 four types of conscience, which is very important if we want to learn vigilance and how to escape
 from all kinds of temptations, delusions, how to live in front of the Lord all the time,
 how to get out of this normal fallen state of mind, state of conscience.
 For most people, a prayer would be just you read some book, ok, it's a prayer book, happens
 to be a prayer book, but your conscience is the same as though you would, say, brush your
 teeth or dump garbage or do something else, wash your car, it would be about the same.
 It's just, ok, ok, now I'm supposed to read, ok, now I read this prayer book.
 And this is why very often we don't have our mind present.
 We say we're distracted, we're always distracted, I cannot focus on prayer, how come?
 Well, this is the reason.
 The reason is that we are on this level of consciousness that is profane, that is fallen
 world, that is just ordinary apostatic, let's call it apostatic level of consciousness.
 Here the term consciousness, please don't think that I'm using some special philosophical
 category or some theory of anthropology or psychology, no, just regular, how you understand,
 you're conscious of something, ok, what are you conscious of, ok, so you'll see from the
 examples that I'll bring what do I mean by these four levels of consciousness.
 And our task in spiritual life is to come to these upper levels of consciousness, eventually
 to this highest, well it's not the highest, ok, the four levels is just a very basic introduction.
 It's more complicated than that, well it's both complicated and simple, there is not
 much complication, but it has more than that.
 Today I'm going to talk about these four, I think it's enough for one video.
 The Lord said, "Be vigilant and pray, lest you fall into temptation."
 And in the Lord's Prayer we say, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the
 evil one."
 What is this vigilance, what is this soberness?
 Soberness is the state when you're not drunk, and the normal state of mind is drunk, ok,
 it's called inspirational vocabulary, ok, for ascetics, they say the whole world is
 drunk, ok, even though you're not drunk, but you are, ok, if you haven't woke up, if you're
 not awakened, ok, spiritually.
 And what is this awakeness, ok, today we will be talking about this, how to reach this awakeness
 and stay in there, and what is the right awakeness, because there are many fake, false awakenesses,
 ok, this enlightenment, I've talked about it before, actually in today's video you could
 also go back and see my other video about mind and reasoning, mind and thinking, ok,
 it was a few months ago.
 So what I'm going to talk about pertains to different, to any circumstance, it's not only
 about prayer, ok, it's about when you do anything, when you talk to people, when you read the
 gospel or any other book, when you do some ministry, some work, some toil, ok, any time,
 any time you could be on one of these modes, ok, so today I'm going to talk about these
 4 modes, ok, most of us, most of the time, sometimes actually we can switch and go back
 and forth, but most of us, most of the time we are on this basic mode which we call a
 rationalistic mode, ok, what do I mean by that?
 So rationalistic mode means that basically you logically can comprehend what is going
 on.
 The best example to see what these modes are is the prayer, ok, so let us use this example
 to understand 3 of the 4 modes of consciousness that I want to introduce today, ok, so the
 basic level of consciousness is rationalistic consciousness.
 It is when we read a prayer book, say we take a prayer book, we read it, but our attention
 is somewhere else, our, we are thinking about something else, we are thinking about when
 do I have lunch, if I have switched off, I don't know, the lights in my room, ok, what's
 going to happen in a few hours, ok, I'm thinking about something else, noise outside, I'm thinking
 about something else, but I'm still reading the book, I'm still reading the prayer book,
 and then I read Amen, I finish the prayer, and I don't really know what I was reading.
 I think all of us have this experience.
 What does this mean?
 This means that I automatically, mechanically, mechanistically just read these words, and
 I can read them because I understand the meaning of each word, but my reason, my attention
 is somewhere else, so this rationalistic, mechanical performance of some task is this
 rationalistic mode of thinking, when our reason, let's call it reason, and our rational ability,
 let's call it logikki, in Greek it's called logikki, racilla, in Latin, the ability just
 to process information is separate, ok, so what is the task, how to know if you're uniting
 your reason and your rational ability, when are they united, when you have full attention
 on what you do, that's one sign, another sign is that when you have a moral judgment about
 what you do, you do something and you understand this is a good thing, or this is a bad thing,
 ok, you have the moral judgment, it's also here, you're conscious of the moral value
 of what you do, this is a sign that your, now we're talking about conscience, that your
 conscience is also present, that means that your reason is present, ok, and another sign
 is that you comprehend it in totality, ok, so these words, they become part of the prayer,
 you see the whole, ok, you can summarize, you can, you have a comprehensive understanding
 of what's in front of you, be it a sentence in a prayer, or be it something else that
 you do, you see it, you see the big picture, ok, and you see the essence of what you're
 doing and what's in front of you, so this is the ability that reason gives you, so if
 we're able to have these three things, ok, three things, one is full attention, another
 is moral judgment about what we do, and the other one is full comprehension, understanding,
 ok, this in totality, ok, what is in front of you, what you're doing, if these three
 things are there, that means that your reason is here, and that means that we are now on
 the second level of consciousness, ok, we are more whole, ok, we are not as dispersed,
 our mind, our reason, sorry, I'm not talking about mind here, our reason is here, however,
 if we are able to recover this, this is not enough, this is not enough, because there
 is another higher level of consciousness, and this is the highest level that I'm going
 to be talking about now, there are other levels, but I'm not talking about it now, today we're
 talking about this highest level of prayer, we call it the prayer of mind, but this mind
 is not secular understanding of mind, it's nous, ok, it's spiritual, sometimes holy fathers
 call it spirit, but we'd rather call it mind, in the sense of nous, not in the sense of
 our mind, ok, be mindful, or don't lose your mind, no, it's not that, it's nous, ok, so
 please get used to this ascetic vocabulary, in ascetism when we say mind, we have something
 else, we're meaning something else, we're not talking about secular mind, so, when is
 my mind also present, ok, this consciousness of the mind, of nous, the consciousness of
 the mind, nous, or mind, is the spiritual aspect of human soul, it is what we call the
 eye of the heart, this eye can see God, this eye is created for God, God created this in
 us for himself, that we can see him, that we can see the kingdom of heaven, that we
 can see what is heavenly, what is divine, what is above everything else, so the whole
 of mind is in the heavens, the more mind opens and is recovered in you, the less care you
 have of this earthly world, ok, you're not escaping it, but you are putting less value
 because in front of you already the kingdom of heaven is opening, and this is what the
 apostle Paul said, that whoever is purchasing, be it like not purchasing, whoever is losing,
 don't be so sorrowful that you're losing something, ok, if you're joyful, don't be too joyful
 about earthly things, because now in front of us already the kingdom of heavens is opening,
 we are standing in front of the Lord's glory, and this can be comprehended only by mind,
 by nous, by the spiritual, in Hebrew it's called neshama, the breath of God, this divine breath
 that the Lord gave to every human, but the problem is that we sinned and we became profane
 and very earthly, down to earth, materialistic, and for most people they don't have this talent
 to see anything spiritual, ok, so this ability to see spiritual reality in some of us is
 just some flesh, very rare, but sometimes we have it like a flesh, we feel something
 spiritual, we know it's coming from the Lord, but then it departs and we go back to this
 profane, secular life and mindset, ok, the task is to always see God in front of you,
 to always be in this dialogue with the Lord, ok, to always understand his will, to always
 see ourselves in this providence of the Lord, in the divine plan, to see that this world
 is ruled by God, ok, and it's not just, ok, it's bad people, it's bad weather, it's this
 and that, no, to see it as a whole, ok, this is very mystical, ok, this is very mystical
 but this is what's beginning to open up to people who recover this consciousness of mind,
 so this is the goal, and then when it's recovered, the consciousness of mind goes hand in hand
 with our reason consciousness, ok, it goes hand in hand, our mind can see spiritual things
 and our reasoning can comprehend and can process these things, can make summary, can make some
 conclusions, ok, it is helping us preserve that state, avoid some situations, it's helping
 us to deal in the right way with things that we are encountering in this world, ok, so
 ok, again, let's go back to our example of prayer, so once we've recovered the reasoning
 that our full attention is on the prayer, on what we read, ok, we understand, we understand
 the, to whom we read it, we understand this directedness of this prayer, the next step
 would be what, not just to understand and be conscious of that, but also to really see
 that you are talking to God right now, to have this reality experience, He is in front
 of you and you are talking to Him, it's not just these prayers that you are reading to
 Him out there, but that now He is in front of you listening and you are opening your
 heart, your mind towards Him, and this is a very intimate and important part of your
 life that is taking place right now, this is the level, it is very high already, so
 having discussed these three levels, let me say what's the fourth one, the fourth one
 is below rational, ok, basically we take another example, say driving a car, ok, you can drive
 a car like mechanically, like automatically, you can be thinking about something else,
 you can be listening to some music, to some lessons, you are processing something else,
 but you know when to turn, when to stop, this is all done on the rational level, ok, your
 attention is split, attention is split away from what you do mechanically, ok, so, however
 if you are drunk, you won't be able to drive well, ok, you will get into some accident
 very quickly, why, because even your rational ability is impaired, and this happens not
 only when you are drunk, when some passion is overtaking you, say you get angry, and
 you hit someone, and then you think why I've done it, it's so stupid, I was not supposed
 to do that, but it's too late, or you kill someone, you've done it, it was sub rational,
 it was irrational in a bad sense, it can be irrational in a good sense, ok, leave it aside
 for now, but that's irrational in a bad sense, and whenever some passion is pulling us towards
 doing something sinful and crazy, that's when we are losing even this basic, even we go
 below animals, because even animals, they have rationality, they know when to run, they
 know this is danger, this is now I need to jump, and they have some kind of rationality,
 even though it's more simple than humans, but humans, we can go even below that, when
 we have this beast waking up inside of us, these snakes which come out and they are pulling
 us towards some sin, something really crazy, really bad, perverted, or something else,
 ok, that's even worse, this is when people get demon possessed, when people commit suicide,
 when they get into some bad scenes, almost they are drowning there, ok, they are losing
 their life, they are harming their relatives, ok, so they become really instruments of devil,
 of course you can be an instrument of a devil even when you are rational, on that rational
 level. And how that works, we don't have enough time now to explain, but that's also possible.
 So today, to sum up, we have discussed these four levels of consciousness. We want to reach
 the mind consciousness. Whenever we, anything, no matter what we do, we see God in front
 of us. We comprehend his will. When we are talking to someone, we also see God in front
 of us. Our heart is still in repentance. We are still consciousness, we are responsible,
 we know that we are on our mission in front of the Lord. We are vigilant spiritually,
 this is what it means. We are reading the gospel, we are doing whatever, participating
 in divine service, doing some work, some toil, we are not split, we are not just mechanically
 doing something, and the time runs so fast because we are wandering somewhere else. No,
 we are fully responsible, we know where we are, what we do, we are the Lord's servants,
 we are on guard, there is a spiritual fight going on, we are overthrowing the enemy, we
 are winning, we are in a spiritual state all the time. This is the consciousness of mind.
 And this is impossible just for us, for you and me, to reach this level. This is always
 a gift of the Lord, because this means some recovery, some healing coming from the Lord,
 this is a talent granted to us by the Lord. But we need to know what we are looking for,
 what we need, we need to see our fallen state, that we need salvation, we need Christ and
 his healing, and then he can grant us. When he deems this appropriate, he will do that,
 he will give us this recovery, this healing, and he will make us strong warriors of his
 glory. So let us think deeply about this wisdom which comes from spiritual fathers, shepherds,
 from the people who have done this struggle with evil forces, with their own fallen self,
 with their passions, and they gave us this precious experience, this precious concept
 of spiritual life that we can use. May the Lord help us on this path, help us recover
 fully, not only our reasoning to be united with rationality, but also most importantly
 our mind, our spirit, our neshamah, so that we can be always with him at any place, no
 matter what we do. May this be so. God bless. Amen.
