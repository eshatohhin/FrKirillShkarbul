 Dear brothers and sisters, we remember the Lord told his disciples to beware of the living
 of Pharisees and the living of Sadducees.
 What does this mean for us today?
 And how is this related to temptations that we need to go through?
 Today I want to share with you some thoughts, both on individual level and on the church
 level.
 Well, first of all, let's take a look, Mark chapter 8 verse 13 to 15.
 And he left them, and entering into the ship, again departed to the other side.
 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread; neither had they in the ship with them more
 than one loaf.
 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware, take heed, beware of the living of the Pharisees
 and of the living of Herod; and they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
 have no bread.
 And the same story in Matthew 6, 5-12, with some extra details, there the Lord is saying
 about the living of the Pharisees and the living of the Sadducees, not Herod, but most
 likely it is the same thing.
 And at the end he is, and they understood later that he is talking about the teaching
 of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
 Well, today we don't have Pharisees and Sadducees around, but both of the Spirit are with us,
 are very much with us.
 And the Lord is saying that this is like a living, I could say it's like a virus, it's
 spreading, it's becoming stronger.
 The Lord also called the message of the Kingdom of God, living of the Kingdom of Heaven, that's
 in Matthew 13, 33.
 So we can say that both in our hearts, and in this church, and in the world for that
 matter, there are these three living, competing in the sense, the living of the Gospel, that
 we hear when we embrace the Gospel and want to follow Christ.
 However, it is choked very quickly, in most people, it's choked by either the living of
 Pharisees or the living of Sadducees.
 And even in the disciples, we will see in the moment, the Lord was testing them and
 he discovered that they have a living of Sadducees especially.
 Well, we can talk a lot about this, what does this mean, there are different interpretations,
 but I want to make it straightforward, I want to make it simple.
 The living of the Pharisees is when our religious life is getting separated from our real life.
 And the Pharisees, they had these external rules, they wanted to have contract with God,
 we do this, this, this, commandments, 613 commandments, we keep all those commandments,
 so that's why they're united with the lawyers, connected with the lawyers in the Gospel very
 often.
 Because those lawyers, they knew the law of God, and they had this table of commandments
 and it was very legalistic.
 This is what we have in the Catholic Church, and in the Orthodox Church, unfortunately
 we have that mindset also, many people have that legalistic approach, scenes, how much
 scenes, this is a big scene, this is a small scene, what do you do to compensate these
 scenes and things like this.
 And the bigger problem is the split between the external and the real, the so-called holy
 and unholy.
 For example, we go to church, this is a holy place, this is a holy time, now I pretend
 I'm holy, this is public, everybody can see me, but when I go out or when I go home, I
 can be devil, I can be whatever, it doesn't really matter, yes I will repent, but basically
 I have a switch, and even in the church, I can be devil inside, I can judge others, I
 can do everything, but I will pretend, I will drink holy water, I will do this, this, this,
 put a candle, pretend I'm a holy one.
 So this separation, and all of us have it, all of us have it, you could even test it
 when you pray, do you pray just the prayer that you're supposed to pray?
 Your heart is somewhere else, be honest with yourself, you're not really talking to the
 Lord when you pray, this is very seen in the spirit, our heart is somewhere else, our mind
 is somewhere else, this is why we're so unstable, because we have that split, and this is related
 to the spirit of Cain, because he has that mindset, I sacrifice to the Lord good things,
 but I keep some for myself, so this is keeping something for myself, this is mine, don't
 worry, this is against the plan of God, this is against the way of salvation, this is why
 he did not receive, did not accept the sacrifice of Cain.
 This whole idea of creating my own world, and just using God for my sake, this is basically
 going to paganism eventually, but still it's trying to pretend, it's trying to keep something.
 Also the Pharisee spirit, very often it's talking about some external rules, and very
 often it's more sort of traditionalist, it's more conservative, most of conservatives are
 Pharisees, this is why the Lord was accusing them, I'm not against tradition, no, it's
 not the problem of tradition, it's the problem of how you take it, you don't have a spirit
 of it, you have only the latter, you take out these traditions, canons or whatever,
 just to hit somebody's head, that's why the Lord has told you, you're using your earthly
 commandments to substitute, to annihilate the commandment of God.
 The thing is that the Pharisee spirit, which is in all of us, just be honest with yourself,
 we are all Pharisees, we are all hypocrites, in many circumstances, due to our vain glory,
 due to our lack of spirituality, due to many reasons, it is separation, essentially what
 it is, is that you are far away from Christ, there is no living relationship with truth,
 you are not bearing the truth in yourself, you're fake, you can be poked and exposed
 that you are filthy, your real wishes, your real mindset is far away from being Christian,
 and this eventually can lead you to the Herodian or to the Sadducee, the living of the Sadducee,
 they're related, they're related.
 What is the living of Sadducee?
 Sadducees were materialists, they said, no resurrection, no spiritual world, it's all
 here, just whatever you see, this is it, and so it's a religious materialism, you can
 say it that way, it's like Marxism, you worship all these things, Communist Party, Lenin,
 whatever, production, progress, these things, your idols, efficiency, and all those things,
 or in capitalism, capital, you worship capital, you worship production, human capital, all
 those things, materialism, technologies, industrial revolutions, all those things, it's all about
 paradise in this world, and this is what you believe in, this is what gives you comfort
 and assurance, and basically you are a materialist, you can say every day that you are Christian,
 you have a big banner, I'm Christian, but the mindset is materialistic, and we can see
 now that the apostles, they have the materialistic mind, so what kind of things, for example,
 you don't do anything before you have a budget, because you believe in this, in money, you
 get the money, then you begin, oh, yes, now, okay, do it, this, this, this, no money, okay,
 no, no, nothing, nothing, it's impossible, because you believe only in material stuff,
 you don't trust the Lord, you trust Mammon, and this was the reason why Jews crucified
 Christ, and that was the reason why they betrayed him so many times, going to these
 pagan gods, you remember that event when they were in the desert for 40 years, they were
 trying God, they were testing God, putting him in temptation, by saying to Moses, we
 have no water, we will, we are thirsty, we will die here, why you brought us here?
 By saying that, basically, what they wanted is they said, okay, if God that you are talking
 about is Almighty, let him do miracle and save us here and give us a drink, okay, you,
 okay, you ask him, if he can do that, okay, then we believe he's Almighty, otherwise,
 we don't need it, we don't want it, we don't trust him, this is tempting God, this is,
 this anti-Christian idea, this is why they were saying, come from the cross and we will
 believe you, remember, and also, they were asking for some signs, give us some signs
 and we believe that it's you, so they wanted this materialistic, powerful Messiah, ruler
 of this world, and they, they all, they wanted all through, from the time in the desert,
 the Lord was trying to save at least someone from that stubborn materialistic mamanists,
 the Israelites, and of course, some were saved, but like very few, and now we cannot expect
 like everybody becomes like that, no, we say, why not everybody is Christian, why the Christians
 are so many, but nobody really follows Christ, okay, it's all heresies, and they have all
 those things, because they want a different thing, they want maman, they don't want Christ,
 most of us are like that, okay, we need to be honest to ourselves also, it's not the
 problem of us, and this is why the Lord is sending temptations, from the time when he
 was with his disciples, we can see in John chapter 6, 5 to 7, this is when he broke the
 five loaves and gave it to the apostles, and they fed 5,000 people, men, not counting women
 and children, so that, that miracle, before doing that miracle, he called Philip, so, when
 Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip,
 thus shall we buy bread that these may eat, and this he said to prove him, to test him,
 to tempt him, okay, in the original, for he himself knew what he would do, Philip answered
 him, 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take
 a little, so he has this calculator here, immediately calculating, okay, so many people,
 how much bread, the most we can think about, we can get 200 denarii, maybe we can get,
 but it's not enough even for them to live a little bit, okay, it's not like even a snack,
 so he failed this test, he failed, because of sadnessy, because of that materialistic
 spirit, and eventually, and we know Philip, he was quite materialistic, when the Lord
 told him, you know the Father, he said, where, where, show us the Father, and it's enough,
 and the Lord told him, Philip, you are with me for so long, and you say you don't know
 the Father, so Philip was quite materialistic, let's know that, but what was the purpose
 then of Jesus Christ asking him this question? The thing is that later, Philip would reflect
 what has happened, and that he, beforehand, he was calculating that only with so much
 money this is possible, so it will be evident for him that his lack of faith is not in line
 with what Jesus is preaching, so he will grow in faith later, and all the temptations that
 the Lord is sending to us every day, we need to use these temptations to grow in faith,
 to get rid of these sadusy and Pharisee spirits, we have a sorrow, we need not to complain,
 but we need to receive it, to face it, and it will help us become more humble, become
 more sincere, not this Pharisee, this pretend, like an actor, this comes through pain, this
 comes through a lot of suffering, and the same thing with the sadusy spirit, we have
 difficulties, struggles, we don't know how to live, we don't know if we have enough money
 next month, no it's not a panic that we need to be shaking and scolding everyone, no, we
 need to trust the Lord, in this hardship I entrust myself to the Lord, yes I do what
 I can, but my trust is in the Lord, and I don't have depression and anxiety and all
 those things, because I don't have money, or something else, okay, and also I said that
 Pharisee spirit brings usually this conservatism and this formalism, Herodian spirit, materialistic
 sadusy spirit, it's very often, it's bringing us, well, it could bring either liberalism
 in the sense that everything goes, as long as it brings benefit, so ecumenism, the spirit
 of adultery, spiritual adultery, in essence, what does it mean?
 I will not have benefits from everyone, okay, we are good with these people, we are good
 with these people, we are good with sects, with Buddhists, so that we can obtain some
 benefit here and there, this is one thing, another thing is become prostitute of the
 government, because they have power, they have resource, so we surrender our faith and
 do whatever they tell us to do, and it could be very autocratic, it could be very totalitarian,
 but it also is because we worship power, we worship might, we worship financial resources,
 this is also sadusy spirit, and usually they are intertwined, the Pharisee and sadusy,
 so Pharisee can also be liberal, like there was this Galil, there was a teacher, there
 were two schools, famous schools, Shammai and Gilel, and that Gilel, he was liberal,
 Shammai was conservative, Gilel was liberal, so, okay, but I don't want to confuse you,
 in essence we understand, that these two things is something that we need to work on, it's
 something that we need to watch out for, whenever we can see, be it in our family, be it in
 the parish, be it in the church, we need to see, okay, this spirit is not, we are not
 loyal to Christ, we're not loyal to truth, whenever we have this, we will betray gospel,
 we will not allow the living of the Kingdom of Heaven to have effect, to raise the bread,
 to raise the, to bring fruit, the Lord is asking, is waiting for us to have fruit, we
 will be eliminating Christ from our life, so this Pharisee is, we can say, his first step,
 and the Sadducee is the second step, which is complete enmity towards Christ, let's put
 it this way, because you replaced him completely with the surrogate of Mammon, but you might
 think you're a Christian, okay, this is something crazy, like those Sadducees, they were still
 thinking that they are pious Jews, okay, however, they were doing exact opposite from what the
 Lord has preached throughout all the Old Testament, it's not something completely new that Jesus
 brought, this was preached throughout the Old Testament, and they were in direct contradiction
 with that, and still they were able to put it together in their mind, this is deception
 from the devil and let us be faithful to Christ, let us overthrow all these things, clean out
 all these filthy living of Pharisees, Sadducees, this idol worshiping, and become true witnesses
 of Christ and his love, his truth, I mean.
 May the Lord be with us, brothers and sisters, God bless.
