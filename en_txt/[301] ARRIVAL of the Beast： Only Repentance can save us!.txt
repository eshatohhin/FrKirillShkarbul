Dear brothers and sisters, this week and this coming Sunday we celebrate Saint Mary of Egypt, the great saint who showed to us what is true repentance, what does it mean to completely forfeit all sins, all passions, everything belonging to this world, and to dedicate herself totally without reservation to Christ. This great saint is a mystery for us, in many things we don't understand about her, but what we do understand is that she had the strong will, strong will to completely cut all the past life and begin the new life, and today I want to share with you regarding repentance, what it is, and practically how to see if we are in repentance, because this is what the Lord calls us, true prayer is true repentance. Pray unceasingly means to repent unceasingly, to have the fear of God unceasingly at any moment of your life, and also I want to share with you a few thoughts about what is going on in the world generally, and of course this is a big, huge topic, but I just want to make a few points, and these two things are related together, okay, they are related because we see that when we repent, we change very often, we change our perspective from external to internal, okay, of course there are many ways of living in sin, in apostasy, okay, in delusion, but the most common is to have yourself directed towards external things, okay, what do I mean by that? I mean that you perceive this world as some external threat, okay, for example, whenever anything happens, okay, you say you have conflict at home, you find a problem with the people, with the other person, or with some situation, the last thing you will think about is that you yourself is wrong, okay, and many other examples, okay, we see the weather, okay, and we say, okay, I feel bad, I don't feel good, maybe because of the weather, or maybe because I ate something wrong, or maybe because something else, okay, we will find some external causes for whatever reasons, okay, and even when we feel something, we would take it as something external, okay, it is some experience, some external experience, we would not find the cause of it in my fault, in my spiritual, in my betrayal of Christ, okay, in my vainglory, in my selfishness, no, this is last thing we would think about, okay, so this is this sign that there is no repentance in us, there is no self-reflection, and we are unable to look upon ourselves with the eyes of the Lord, as the Lord would look upon us, and the voice that we used to have, maybe when we were young, the voice of consciousness, it becomes weaker and weaker, and we don't hear it very often, we only feel, well, I'm not supposed to do that, because people will think this and that, and if I do that, maybe I'm not, I will betray myself, because I have my rules, my principles, but if I fail, then, okay, I'm gonna lose, etc., okay, we can see clearly this spirit in every heresy, okay, we can see it in the catholic heresy, this is why it's so difficult for a catholic to acknowledge some issue with himself, because basically he finds that everyone else is guilty, I have encountered many, many times when there is a family issue, and one side is catholic, he will always be right, of course, this is common not only for catholics, but for catholics especially, and of course, this became even more so with the protestants, okay, with the heresy, because there everyone became a pope, okay, it's a, essentially, this is the deification of man, in the sense that you replace God with yourself as an idol, okay, and repentance is about crushing this idol, please think about it, brothers and sisters, because this is something that, that is the only way for us to get out of the whole deception, if we don't have this truth living in us, we will fall victim of some kind of deception, and there are so many different ways to deceive people, and now with all the heretics being deceived a long time ago, okay, we will also now have even orthodox are deceived so much, even some pastors, they are following behind the prince of this world, okay, in building his kingdom of antichrist, and they think that they serve God, and they think that they are orthodox Christians, okay, we are living in a very, the time of challenge, and the time of testing, the Lord is testing us, okay, this is those times that the trial will come upon the whole world, this trial will need to reveal who truly loves God, and is able, and is willing to sacrifice himself totally without reservation for him, and this is the path that Saint Mary of Egypt has shown us, okay, so I want to show you this link between these two topics, the topic of repentance, and the topic of what is going on now in the world. 

The last thing about repentance I want to say today is that there is a saint, Saint Father John the Kolobos, he is ascetic father, who lived in Egypt for many decades, and he wrote a lot about principles of ascetism and repentance, and he gives us this parable, he gave us the parable that the soul is, okay, I shouldn't say that, the parable is like this, there is a harlot, okay, there is a harlot that lives in somewhere like Mary of Egypt at some point, okay, so, and he, and she has, you know, relationship with, like, so many people out there, okay, she's a harlot, and, okay, she's that demon possessed, you can say, that she is doing it even for fun, even not for money, okay, doesn't matter, okay, and one day there is a prince, there is, well, she doesn't know that he's a prince, it's just a man, very noble, very virtuous, very chaste, very pure man, okay, of pure life, and he comes to her, and he gives her an offering, okay, if you promise to cut all your relationships with all these people, you don't fornicate anymore, okay, I can take you as my bride, you will be my wife, okay, even though I'm clean, I don't have anything like you have, all this dirt, all this filthiness, but I'm willing to, okay, to accept you as is, okay, and she agreed to that offering, and she lived with him in his house, and every evening those perverts, okay, those people, those men, they came and said to her, okay, let's go, okay, we know who you are, okay, don't pretend to be so holy, so clean, we know who you are, let's go have fun, okay, but even though they were coming there every day, every night, she never accepted any offers like that, and she remained loyal to her husband, to this noble man. So, Saint John the Kolobos, he says that this is our soul, our soul is this harlot who's repented, and now she has this choice, either to be, and the groom, this noble man, is Christ himself. So, now the soul has this choice to be either loyal to Christ, to live with him in sanctity, in chastity, okay, in virtue, or she can go back to this filthy, dirty, corrupted life, leading to perdition, leading to slavery in hell. 

So, this is the choice, brothers and sisters, this is what we see from Saint Mary of Egypt, that she's made this choice, and she wasn't going back and forth like we do, rather than let us be honest to ourselves, okay, this is true repentance. So, let us think deeply about these things, let us laugh long prayers, today, this morning, we had five-hour prayer service, okay, let us laugh such long prayers, let us be in repentance, let us be in humbleness, this will keep us from the deception, okay, and now coming to this deception that we have, that is drawing, trying to draw the whole world into its agenda, okay, including Christians, and, okay, I'm talking about Orthodox Christians, because actually saints, they call heretics anti-Christians, okay, so that you know, it's, this is normal language, so we normally don't call them Christians, okay, it's time to repent, brothers, if you haven't repented and forsaken your organization or sect, okay, which calls itself Christian, please do it soon, otherwise might be too late. So, the deception is like this, Leviathan has, not Leviathan, prince of the world, the Satan, okay, he has, or the spirit of anti-Christ, you can call it as you wish, okay, it's this spirit which is out there, which is getting ready to bring everyone into slavery to devil, to worship of devil, so the devil himself or his representative, this doesn't matter, okay, so this prince of the world, of this world, has two paradigms or two models, if you wish, okay, one is the harlot of Babylon, another is Leviathan the beast, okay, the harlot of Babylon, okay, it's liberalism, it's anarchism, it's, okay, buy, sell, okay, everything can be sold, capitalism, in some sense, okay, and the spirit of the beast, Leviathan, is totalitarian, fascism, okay, all kinds of dictatorship, okay, war, and all these things, okay, and these two things, they complement each other, okay, they are not hostile to each other, sometimes they pretend to be fighting with each other, but this is just a game, okay, they have intercourse between each other, okay, this is what we see from the book of revelation, so Leviathan is portrayed like a big fish or like the serpent which lives in the waters or like a crocodile, okay, so sometimes, so you don't see him, but sometimes all of a sudden he comes out and he is eating you, okay, he is this beast, this monster, okay, and then maybe he goes back and you don't see him as though, okay, you don't see where he is, okay, he's gone, so what is, and then you are left to this harlot of Babylon, okay, who takes care of things while he's away, okay, this is simplification, but essentially this is what is going on with the world right now, the world was, of course, all the time the world has both, okay, but there was appearance that now the anarchism, the so-called democracy and free world and all these things, free trade, etc. 

is in the mainstream, okay, and however when needed Leviathan used his stick, okay, recently in China, in many places, okay, in Russia, which is also both harlot and Leviathan, okay, and China for that purpose, but now this time when Leviathan was actually concealed is over, so basically Leviathan is coming out, and this is called, you can call it externalization of evil or a manifestation of the kingdom of this prince of the world Leviathan, you can call him whatever you want, because he needs absolute power, okay, he doesn't want this to be behind the curtains all the time, he wants to have people openly worship him, okay, know what's going on, you worship me, I'm your king, okay, this is what is needed, and now we are in this time of this transferring to this manifestation of this Leviathan, we had it in 2020, that was the first step, then we have the 2022, this war breakout, okay, and in this process, okay, whatever remained from orthodox civilization, orthodox world had to be destroyed completely, and it's going to be ongoing, okay, until they reach this goal, okay, even though most of Russia is of course betrayed Christ, but there is still, there is still loyalty to Christ in Russia, in the church, not in the official maybe, okay, but within the church there is a very strong force loyal to Christ and to sanctity, and there is a goal to get this out of the way, okay, and so this is one of the reasons, of course, this war had many reasons, okay, but this war also prompts what is happening now, okay, and now we are coming to the next stage, and the next stage is the so-called democratic and free world will know that it's no more democratic and free, okay, this will over, okay, this part of history is gonna be over, okay, in terms of free trade, in terms of democracy and all these things, there was not much democracy before that, but it was concealed, there was this spectacle, there was this theater pretending that we are democracy, okay, but there was no democracy, okay, but now everybody has to see that there is no democracy, it has to be explicit, okay, so don't think that it's just about Trump or about, okay, some world leaders thinking this, thinking that, okay, you might ask and who is this architect, who is playing this whole thing, I could tell you that it may be not people, okay, maybe there is some secret group which is super wise and who is controlling the whole world, maybe, but it's not the main point, the main point that behind this is a spirit, okay, and this spirit can use, can use both those crazy liberals, he can use those dictators, he can use those perverts with a sodomite agenda, he can use anyone, drug dealers, okay, he can use traders, bankers, okay, he is behind these things, okay, and he has some plan, okay, and of course, I'm not here saying that he is like God, he controls the whole world and the whole history, but he will be given this power, we read in the book of Revelation that eventually the Antichrist will be given power over all nations in the world, we read this from the holy scripture because of the apostasy, because most people will be willing to accept that, will be willing to receive that, so now he is coming out not for any other reason other than people are ready, people are ready to receive that, to be, to, they chose to live, to trust the lies, okay, to live by the lies and to be in this whole agenda, in this whole path which is open to them by the prince of this world, okay, and it can eat up everyone, okay, except the people who truly repent, we're coming back, only if you are, you, not your parish priest, not your bishop, not your, you are loyal to Christ, okay, now this war is going to go through your heart, whether you submit yourself to this spirit of Antichrist, and it is a spirit, okay, you might be against Trump or, I don't know, Biden or whoever, but if you sin, if you submit yourself to passion, you will be eventually drawn by Antichrist into blindness and apostasy, okay, this is inevitable, and no matter if you're just a layman or a priest or a patriarch or bishop or monk, okay, if you don't love Christ from your, from the depth of your heart, you will fail, okay, and this temptation is coming upon the whole world, and we read about that in the holy scripture, that the temptation is going to come upon the whole world, and now it is the time, brothers and sisters, so let us be vigilant, let us love prayer, long prayer, let us love vigilance and dedicating ourselves totally without reservation to studying the holy scripture, to a prayer, to searching for truth, to spiritual life, hesychasm, and only that can keep us afloat, can keep us with the Lord, okay, the spirit of Christ will be with us, and the devil will not be able to pull us astray and lead us into destruction, may the grace of the Lord be with us, may his blessing, his wisdom be with every one of us, let us love our Lord with all our heart, and have a clear decision to follow him till the end, no matter what it takes, I mean, God bless, brothers and sisters. One, one last thing, something that we are gonna have in the world will be a little bit similar to the Soviet Union, okay, with one difference, Soviet Union was totalitarian, with one little difference, that in Soviet Union quite many people, they understood that it's all a lie, but now most people will love it and will completely embrace it, okay, this will be the only difference, so be ready that in a few years we will be living in some sort of Soviet Union-type world, okay, God bless.
