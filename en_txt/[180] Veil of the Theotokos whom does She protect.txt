 Dear brothers and sisters, every year on October 14th the Holy Church celebrates
 the feast of the veal or pakrov or protection of the Holy Theotokos.
 Today is Sunday October 16th already but still we are in this celebration and I
 want to share with with you what this feast is all about and what does it mean
 to us at this time especially now while there is this misunderstanding that
 protection extends over the whole nation or whole city we need to understand
 where is this feast coming from why it's so important why it's celebrated not in
 all the churches okay well first of all this feast is based on miracle that
 happened in the 10th century when Constantinople at the time the capital
 of Byzantine and capital of the whole Orthodox Church was the biggest most
 important city for the Orthodox Church this city was surrounded by enemies most
 likely it was they were coming they were Muslims most likely okay invading from
 from the Middle East okay so they came they surrounded the city and there was
 not much hope in salvation but people and the Emperor and patriarch they
 gathered in the church of Lajerna Lajerna Church is an ancient church in
 Constantinople that had the greatest relic the cloth of Mother Mary which was
 brought from the Holy Land in the 5th century and they gathered in this church
 and they had the night service it was all night vigil so they were praying all
 night and that was on this day on October 14th old style it's October 1st
 so they were praying on the early morning that night night around 4 a.m.
 at about 4 a.m. they see not they the among them were two saints Saint Andrew
 and say and his disciple Saint Epiphanes so these two saints they are praying in
 this church also with everybody but they two of them they see a vision they see a
 vision that the Holy Theotokos is approaching the altar in heavens and
 there is the solemn procession she is accompanied by a Saint John the Baptist
 and Saint John the theologian the apostle and many other saints and holy
 people and angels and they have this procession great procession that's
 coming to this altar in the heavens and once they approach the altar the mother
 of God is taking the veal what is the veal? Amophorion. Amophorion is a like a
 kerchief but it's longer it becomes like part of the cloth it's it's a long long
 kerchief and she's taking this kerchief this veal and she's extending it on top
 of the faithful we see at the back at the back here is the icon the holy icon
 of the pakrov of the veal of the mother Mary so she's extending this this veal
 over faithful who are praying and then she's taking it back and the whole
 procession is leaving but the grace of the protection is staying with the
 people and people feel this this protection and all of a sudden those
 Saracens those enemies which were surrounding the pagans they run away
 they run away and they were scared by something we don't know and they
 surrender they return to their place so this miraculous salvation of the city
 was celebrated was celebrated this instance that happened was celebrated by
 the church and this feast was established by the patriarch okay at
 that time it was Emperor Leo Leo the sixth okay he under him who this this
 was established so hmm this piece becomes very important and especially two
 centuries later in Russia under Duke st. Andrew pogolubov this is also a great
 ruler who ruled in Vladimir in Sousa and in those days it was it was like a
 capital of the Russian land at the time it was a very important place was like
 northern capital and he built a big church of the protection of the mother
 Mary which is still there we can still go and see it it's more than 800 years
 old and this piece becomes very important in Russia from that time and
 and onwards okay and until now and it's even more important in the Russian
 Church than in other churches okay but other churches they also venerate
 protection of the mother Mary but it the main feast for that is the Saturday of
 the akathistos which is the Saturday of the fifth week of the great land okay
 and the akathistos is also a glorification hymn of the mother Mary
 which was written as a praise for her miracles of protection that happened
 also in ancient times in the seventh and eighth centuries and so no matter which
 day is chosen for celebration they to celebrate the protection of the mother
 Mary became so important in the church because the faithful they understood
 that mother has a special power of intercession of asking her son and she
 has also a special kindness to the faithful as as a mother her love is a
 love of a mother and this love we know that mother loves without ranch without
 this judge me judging this is right this is wrong very often is the father
 who has more okay this is not supposed to be like this and father may be more
 strict even though he loves the child he is more strict but mother okay
 sometimes she may try to be strict but when the child is really asking her for
 something she says okay no whatever you want yeah I cannot be strict anymore and
 which may be unreasonable and even may spoil the chat but no matter what that's
 how mother is real true mother heart is like this so the faithful I feel they
 felt this if they feel it and they are asking the mother of God to pray for
 them and when she does they receive the protection from her son because he
 cannot refuse the question is why there were instances when also many people
 gather in the church and they pray but nothing okay in the Constantinople in
 other places okay we have other examples many times the most famous is when
 Casanova was taken by the Turks in 1453 when they also prayed and they also came
 to the same church but okay it didn't help and Casanova fell and was
 plundered, burned, destroyed badly and all the holy things the relics books
 everything destroyed or taken stolen by the Crusades, by those crossbearers the
 Crusades the knights who were supposedly Christian but they were not of course by
 the deeds judge them from the deeds okay so why why not always we have what we
 are asking for there are two reasons for that one reason is that sometimes it's
 too late okay if you are too far from the Lord you don't care about prayer you
 don't care about going to church you don't care about righteous life it's
 just something far away from your life and you live in sin in ignorance and all
 of a sudden you have a big problem okay something some punishment is coming you
 go to the church right no it doesn't work like that it's not okay just like
 pagan thing you bring something sacrifice and you get it your heart
 should be able to ask like a child to ask for the protection for the mercy of
 the Lord you should be able to to ask mother of God as her child not just
 come okay give me okay I need your help no so that's one of the reasons when
 people are too far it's already too far okay too bad okay no the the help the
 protection will not be extended another problem is that sometimes we have this
 wrong understanding especially those Orthodox former Orthodox countries
 people who are like ethnically Orthodox they were supposed to be Orthodox by
 their ethnicity which is nonsense okay they may think sometimes that okay we
 ask for protection of the whole Russia or whole the whole country whole Greece
 or Bulgaria or Ukraine and we need we were service protection and no this is
 fairytale this doesn't work anymore maybe at some point the Lord had this
 special relationship with some nation but after everyone all nations betrayed
 him now we can have a hope that he protects his church which is not okay a
 statistical Church okay nominal membership no it's those people who
 leave who enter into this covenant with the Lord at least they try to leave
 according to that covenant those people they can have a chance of being saved
 even from such a great punishment that is coming and maybe not okay doesn't
 have to because the martyrs they were not saved from those people who torture
 them so it's not something that today that is just a grant okay or it has to
 be according to some plan it will be according to the Lord's will and maybe
 his will is that you are not spared from black or from war from death maybe no
 maybe yes but there is still a purpose for you to plead and to ask for his
 salvation and for the protection of mother Mary and there are good chances
 that she will hear you if you plead like a child and ask her to give you to pray
 on your behalf so if you pray you repent you receive the protection the person
 next to you he lives in the scene he doesn't repent he doesn't know he
 doesn't receive this lecture why he should receive this protection okay so
 and maybe both of you will get killed we don't know okay but it's not logical to
 expect that everybody is going to be protected because of because we are all
 Russians for example no not anymore so let us be wise it's not some
 individualistic thinking we're still part of the church we're still saved as
 family of Christ all together but who who is this family who are the true
 Christians it's maybe just few people here and there not that many scattered
 sometimes so maybe you won't see you will feel that you alone you're not
 alone but there might be no one else around you who is who is repenting and
 craving and who is really hurt by mother Mary by Jesus Christ by Saints okay so
 so when we feel that maybe father will be too strict and I don't dare and I am
 not worthy of his mercy okay we ask the Lord have mercy but sometimes we feel
 that okay I'm really not worthy of that mercy but even if we're not worthy and
 we are like really far we still have a chance then if we plead to the mother of
 God if we ask her beg her that she can look at us regardless of all our sins of
 all the stain that we have on our soul regardless of all of that she can look
 at us as upon her child children and she will plead on our behalf and the miracle
 will happen and we will be spared if that will be according to the gods will
 so let us ask for mother Mary ask for her protection of her view to be above
 us upon us upon our relatives our families so that we can be integrated
 into the divine plan of salvation and not into the overall plan of apostasy
 and parishion let us pray for that and let us thank our Lord for his joy of
 being his children and being on this path of salvation with him with all the
 saints who are together with the mother Mary and who are praying now for us and
 for the Church of Christ I mean may the Lord be with all of you I mean god bless
