Dear brothers and sisters, many faithful share with me that they feel that others who are atheists, agnostics, buddhists, heretics, very often they are better, okay? They live a better life, more honest, more friendly, even more self-sacrificing, and they themselves, they don't understand how come. How come me, who have the right faith, who chose to follow Jesus, okay, not some, I don't know, Buddha or Krishna or something else, the true God, and yet I'm so far away from the saints, from the gospel, from everything that the Lord has taught, I don't feel, okay, in my daily life, I'm just as everyone else, okay? And just some people, some orthodox, they would share these things with me, but many would not even notice this, okay? And today I want to say a few words about this ability that we need to world which is in apostasy, okay, which lives without God, without Christ, okay, and seems to be, I don't know, smart, interesting, easygoing, okay, well educated, etc. Okay, this world, not all of the people who are away from Christ are like drug addicts or criminals or in some, you know, evident sin, okay, or just destroy everything or, you know, unfortunate in their family life, in their unsuccessful and, okay, lazy, etc. 

No, quite many people, they are okay, okay, they have families, they have work, they have a good education, they are not stupid or lazy or dumb or, okay, addicted to, I don't know, drugs, alcohol or something else. No, not all, not all the world. So, the problem arises, how come, how come we orthodox Christians, disciples of Christ, who aim at being the pillar of faith and truth, and that we are the kingdom of heaven here on earth, how come we are lacking so much and we are not able to find something better, something more inspiring within faith, within the church, and are looking outside for entertainment, for social communication needs that we have, okay, for educational stuff, okay, etc. 

How come? Well, everyone has this need for social approval, okay. From childhood, okay, we need to be part of some group, okay, we need some acceptance, some approval, support, okay, we don't want to be marginalized, we don't want people to say that we are deficient in some way, etc. So, from early childhood, we have this search for this approval, we want to be on the same wavelength as others, okay, on the same platform as others, okay. 

Yes, we want to be unique in some way, so it's interesting, okay, we want to be intriguing to others, okay, however, we want to be on the same level with them, okay, so that people wouldn't say, okay, there's something wrong with you, I don't want to communicate with you. So, this creates this big problem that Christians are ashamed of cross, consciously or subconsciously, okay, and that they don't find cross as the source of life, as the source of motivation, inspiration, okay, and they find surrogates in this world, and we are, all of us, almost all of us are like that. This is a very troubling fact, and today I want to share with you on how to get out of this, and how not to drown in this apostatic world, okay. 

Well, of course, we don't want to become autists, okay, or sociopaths, okay, people who are either because of psychological problems, okay, or maybe even physical issues, neurological, okay, that they have some problems, okay, within this world, okay, it could be, it could be maybe some trauma, okay, that someone, you know, at some point experienced this evil, this harm from this society, from some people in this society, and now he's afraid, or she's afraid, and, okay, closes herself, himself, and creates this small little world, which is more comfortable, which is safe, okay, in this world, maybe there will be some hobbies, there will be some entertainment, there will be, okay, of course, always someone to blame, okay, for everything, for my pain, for this, for that, okay, so this is a very miserable existence of someone who has not found God as refuge, okay, and that's why we have so many people now are drowning in despondency, in all kinds of, you know, fake life, surrogates, people do tattoos, you know, mostly because of loneliness, of despondency, okay, life is gloomy, okay, let me do one more tattoo, okay, or to show off, okay, you see how special I am, okay, it's canine, we're living in a canine world, brothers and sisters, okay, and, of course, there is so many different situations, I cannot just put everything in two categories, okay, we have all kinds of situations in this world, and even with this, so, let's call it solidarism, okay, solidarism, this tendency to say we, us, okay, we are part of something, okay, there is one big, let's call it egregore, okay, it's a special term, but I think most people understand it, it's like a thought form or some kind of common agenda, common framework, okay, there will be a big one that you will see, let's say, when you watch news, okay, it will bring up some common issues, everybody has to be aware of global warming, of threat from this political situation, from this, from that, everybody should know what happened recently, I don't know, in congress, let's say, or somewhere else, this is common knowledge, if you don't know, you're strange, okay, so, this is some common, big, so-called society, which is imposed on you, and you just become part of it, even unconsciously, and there are smaller ones, okay, there are smaller ones, okay, you're part of some political view, you're green, you know, or you are, let's say, I don't know, pro-Trump, or pro-something, and then, of course, you're always against someone else, okay, and you are special in some way, but you are special within this group, and almost everyone needs something like that, okay, needs to be part of something like that, and they are super clever in making you feel that you are part of that, okay, through language, through rhetoric, through all kinds of manipulation, psychological techniques, etc., etc., and now even some special techniques, like, I don't know, imagery, and, okay, all of these things, they are developed to a very high scientific level, okay, what time should things appear, or what kind of rhythm should be playing in the radio, or in the, you know, those advertisements, all of that is already very sophisticated, and very efficient, okay, effective, rather, so, and efficient, okay, so, when we become Christians, when we become Orthodox Christians, if we are very sincere and honest, we will be looking for an alternative, we will see that this world is problematic, okay, for some period of time we become like autistic, okay, we distance ourselves from this world, which brings all those perverted values, etc., etc., we distance ourselves from it, and then we still, we need to find other people who would love Christ in the same way as we do, and then to have this openness, and a mutual love with those people, even the Lord, he said that, who are my brothers and sisters, and my mother, those who listen to the word of God, and do it, live by it, and he also promised to us that whenever we abandon family, properties, okay, our lifestyle, for him and his name's sake, for the sake of the kingdom of God, we will get hundredfold, okay, but very often we come to the church, and we don't find it, we don't find that support, we don't find that mutual love, that understanding, okay, not from the people, nor from the priest, and we think what, what, what is going on, okay, and then after some time, for obvious reasons, because most of our time we spend not in the church, we spend it at home, or in the work, we become drawn back into the mindset, into the worldview of our family, or work, co-workers, or whatever, bloggers, stuff that we watch, that we listen, listen to, okay, and less and less we feel that we're part of the kingdom of heaven, and it becomes just extra two, three hours on the Sunday that we, okay, now we go, we pray, we do what we're supposed to do, our children maybe go to the Sunday school, everything is done, okay, go back, and we continue to live in this apostasy. This becomes, I would say, almost a norm these days, which is really scary, and which is not the way, well, it means that we're not Christians, in essence, it means that, okay, just forget it, okay, we are not disciples of Christ, we don't love people around us, we get angry, we condemn them, we don't care about them, all of that is because we did not find that love towards Christ. So, brothers and sisters, today I want to stress one thing, I want to stress that we need to nurture the vigilance, we should not always expect something from others, okay, this vigilance, it will help us siphon through, siphon out, okay, all the stuff, filter out, all the stuff which is belonging to this world, no matter if we happen to watch something, or listen to something, or talk to some people, okay, we can quickly distinguish, okay, this is a spirit of the world, this is not part of me, I'm not part of this, okay, I am in this world, but I am not part of this world, okay, this vigilance should be with you all the time, you know, every moment of your day, okay, whenever, I don't know, you happen to encounter anything, okay, so some people who've understood how important this is, they stopped communicating in many chats, even some share with me that they used to feel that, okay, they have this need to do mission, to go into some chats, to write this, to write commentaries, and at some point it just can't, it was cut out, okay, they just felt that it's a waste, it's a waste of time, okay, we need to focus on something more concrete, okay, prayer, the holy scripture, testimony towards people whom I see, okay, and not in some chats, groups, or something like that, okay, so they've changed in terms of their spiritual life, they've changed in terms of their mission approach, and every other aspect of their life, for that matter, okay, and so one thing is vigilance, and another thing is not to expect others, and not to expect much stuff from others, okay, that my church is supposed to be that and this, and the priest is supposed to be like a pastor, good, loving, caring, etc., and all monasteries, there are people supposed to be so holy and so spiritual, whenever you have those expectations, you will be disappointed big time, and the Lord won't give you that kind of joy to have that kind of communication, but if we are humble, if we see that the problem is in us, it's not in others, problem is in us, first and foremost, then he will give us great joy, he will give us great blessings, he will guide us like he was guiding those prophets who were sometimes just one, surrounded by thousands of Baal worshippers, so let us put effort into spiritual life, brothers and sisters, let us become bastions, fortresses of life in Christ, okay, everything can be destroyed, your church can be blown up, your family, your house, everything can be destroyed, but if you are in God, okay, you will be in him, okay, no matter what, so what does this mean to be in Christ, okay, how to be sure, how not to be falling into fake spirituality, okay, how to sustain ourselves in Christ, in this living love relationship with him, this is the goal, brothers and sisters, this is the goal each and every one of us has to set, and with this goal in mind, we can be sure to be his witnesses, to have enough courage and strength to withstand any temptation, tribulation, okay, to bring abundant fruit of faith, and there is so few people like this right now, brothers and sisters, let us feel this belongingness to the kingdom of God, this great responsibility that every one of us has, okay, this expectation that the saints have, okay, in us, okay, they expect us to keep doing that testimony that they were doing, that they died for, okay, so in this apostatic and fallen world, let us not be fooled, cheated by the spirit of this world, every community, every group that I've just mentioned has some kind of spirit behind it, and also when you see people around you, your relatives, your beloved ones, not opening up to faith, not willing to pray, not willing to repent, don't give up on them, don't give up on them, okay, Apostle Paul says that love never ceases, love hopes for everything, okay, you have to have that hope, you, okay, don't think, okay, okay, these people, I know, I know that they never pray, they never care, okay, no, don't be like that, okay, okay, if we have this hope, if we have prayer which is alive for our beloved ones, okay, then the Lord will hear this prayer, He will do things in due time, okay, miraculous things, so let us, let us not give, give, give up, okay, let us have great patience to, for as many years, as many decades maybe as needed to, okay, to to do our own mission and to work on our own spirituality, okay, to always see the Lord in things we do, in things we learn, and to share Him with all the people around us, not necessarily through words, sometimes through our kindness, through our self-sacrifice, our care, okay, this will make us true Christians, may the Lord help us, keep us free from all those spirits, it's so easy to be overwhelmed by some kind of spirit, by some kind of passion, may the Lord help us stand in truth not to fall and not to grow in love towards Him and towards others. 

Amen. God bless, brothers and sisters.
