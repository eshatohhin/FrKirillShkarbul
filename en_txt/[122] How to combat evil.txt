 Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about the strategy how to
 fight with evil or how to withstand evil in this world.
 Last time we've talked about the apostasy and we may think that well these evil powers
 they are getting stronger and the whole world is going in the wrong direction and we can
 do anything.
 We are on lockdown maybe, we cannot even go out, we cannot influence big things, big projects.
 We are not presidents, we are not some media, we don't have finance, we don't have anything.
 So we just have bad mood, we cannot do much and we are just ready to die, we don't want
 this life.
 This is very wrong conclusion, we need to have completely different attitude towards
 this life, we need to be soldiers of Christ, no matter what happens, no matter what times
 we live in, no matter what's around us, like Lot, he lived in Sedoma and Homora and he
 was the only righteous man in his family and even his wife was attached to that world,
 she looked back and she became the pillar of salt.
 So we remember their dialogue, Abraham asked for forgiveness, for remission to the town
 so that it's all destroyed, it was a big huge town, it was over 1,500 years of civilization
 in that place, very prosperous, very beautiful, but people were corrupt, like today, the whole
 society was quite corrupt, but the Lord told Moses that even 10 righteous men will save
 this place, why, what do they do?
 Just be a righteous man and live there and it will save this place from this wrath of
 the Lord and give it extra time for repentance.
 So even to be a righteous man, just your own life, don't allow sin to enter into your heart,
 fight with all these passions, just that is a great victory over evil.
 But today I want to say more, ascetics and personal spiritual life is a crucial basis
 for anything else, if we don't have it, we won't be able to do anything else, we will
 be off right away.
 And even when we feel that today I am weak, I am defiled, I have no power, just keep struggling,
 just have patience, pray, tomorrow the Lord will give you power, one week from now the
 Lord will give you power, we need to know that we will gain this health if we persist
 in fighting with evil, with passions, with our addictions, we need to eradicate any kind
 of addiction, internet addiction, of course any smoking or drinking, any other addiction
 we need to get rid of, it will spoil us, it will make us weak, it will make us unable
 to say anything, we will be down and we will be out, the devil wants us out of the equation.
 So now let us talk about what we can do, first of all we need to remember this theory of
 small deeds, that we can do things maybe not so great, not so big, but it will be very
 important in the Lord's eyes, we don't need to think about influencing big trends and
 things like that, because if we think only that we will lose, we will be unable to do
 anything, because we are now dispersed, everybody is by himself pretty much, but even being
 dispersed and being on my own I can do many things.
 Many people they talk a lot, but only about these big projects, because they think that
 maybe some big government people will hear them and will change everything, no, we should
 not always be living in some dreams or change the world, we need to grasp some little things.
 What kind of little things?
 There is a saying that every great man behind him there is a great woman, you never see
 her, but maybe it's his mother, or maybe it's his wife, but it's a person that does everything
 to support him small little things, maybe make a coffee, maybe it's very minor things,
 but it is of great importance for him and his power, he does great big things that everybody
 knows about, we need to be ready to be that person invisible one, that does some minor
 things, but in the end the Lord will produce something great, all the saints during even
 worse times than we have now, there were people who were doing things that were not noticeable
 to others, for example Saint Cyril and Methodius, they were just simple monks, they went into
 this pagan place Moravia and they just preached in some villages and they've just done some
 things minor things, at that time bishops and patriarchs and pope of Rome they were
 having some strategies getting this is my country, this is my country, they had some
 big big plans, big projects, that was very important and influenced the whole world,
 but at the end for the Lord, no, we don't even remember what they've done, but we know
 what was done by Saint Cyril and Methodius, because as a result of those methods that
 they used, a result of those contributions, they've made the divine service in the local
 language, those principles, they've influenced a great many people for more than a thousand
 years, we have the whole Russia become Christian, Orthodox, we have the church can see, even
 though there were different preachers at that time in that place, but they were maybe involved
 in politics and stuff, and they did not have that approach that Cyril and Methodius had,
 they were just doing the thing for the Lord, this is what we need to do, do small thing
 for the Lord, in the Old Testament we have also that tribe of Dan, one of those twelve
 brothers, twelve patriarchs, Dan, if we read the blessing that he gained, he gained the
 blessing to care for those who are behind, to care for those who are weak or sick, those
 brothers who are getting hurt at the back, so he helped them, and it was not something
 major, it's not conquering something big, so for example, many people, they don't want
 to care about those special students, but the spirit, no, I will care for the teachers,
 even though I need to spend a hundred times more power, energy, time to teach him just
 simple things, to use the spoon to eat food, maybe he will not become any champion, or
 any great scientist, leader, or anything else, but he will just know how to eat this food
 with the spoon, and that will be more important when you prepare him, make him a scientist,
 that little thing for the Lord is more important, your heart is more important, even though
 he will be just the same as everybody else, he will just be able to eat food, so we need
 to know about the spirit, the spirit of time, something not known, but it's important for
 the Lord.
 So in the war that we are in, the spiritual war, I'm talking about war, it's not that
 I want people to be aggressive, our weapons is the word of God, is love, is the message
 of the good news of the gospel, of salvation, we love our people who think that we are their
 enemies, we love everybody, we love sinners, our position is very different, it's not war,
 like physical war, this spiritual war is the war of light shining in the darkness, so we
 just need to find a way to have this light shine.
 But the war, there are different situations, there are position wars, when the two armies
 are not moving too much either way, they are just exchanging some artillery hits, and now
 we see that evil is pushing in, it's trying to advance, so in many ways it's already conquered,
 for example moral values, society, young people, family values, many values, we already are
 conquered, our society, maybe not as our own, but the society overall, and we are also hacked
 in many ways, so in those aspects where we are still trying to keep the position, we
 need to have our position stronger, our own spirituality and our family, these are the
 things that we can influence, our friends, people who trust us, we need to help them
 to become stronger, to have more solid values, to have a sound spiritual life, this will
 matter in this position war, because the devil, he doesn't want to make advance too fast,
 because he will be thrown back, so he is pushing in slowly, step by step.
 We need to know about that, and he is doing it also on this individual level, not only
 through media, but through big things, even on individual level, through Facebook, TikTok,
 from all these things, the garbage stuff that there is, he is trying to spoil people one
 by one, so we need to keep that position.
 Another thing is, in those areas where we are already conquered, we need to be like
 this gorilla, or like those partisans, those people who are in the forest, and sometimes
 they do hit, they hit the enemy, so we need to do that, how we do that?
 With the Word of God, and I will also bring some advice on what we can do, and also one
 thing we need to recall is that the Lord is almighty, he is the Lord of strength, holy
 God, holy mighty, holy mortal, have mercy on us, this mighty, this aspect of might that
 the Lord has, is also brought in the Isaiah 11 2, seven spirits, we are asking for the
 Spirit of God to give us his gifts, one of the spirits that the Lord gives us is the
 Spirit of might, of strength, and in the Holy Psalms, prophet David says, those who rely
 on God, on the Lord, they will be like mild Zion, will not ever move, we have that power.
 The Lord says, build your house on a rock, rock of faith, that rock, so this might is
 something that we can rely on, it's Christ himself, and we need to live so that we have
 this might of the Lord, and this will help us in any kind of war that we are doing in
 withstanding this evil, okay, so this is very important, we need to recall, it's not the
 devil who has the might, it's we who have this might, who can gain this might, okay,
 become like mild Zion, okay, so now projects, so what kind of projects we can do, okay,
 of course, everybody has his own talents, everybody has his own experience, okay, we,
 first of all, we don't need to think about all new things, something new, first of all,
 we look around, let us think what we have done, we began doing, we already have experience,
 we already have maybe connections or something, okay, what can I do, okay, for the Lord, it
 was it would be like when I was young, I was strong and fast and skinny, but now I'm fat,
 so all those projects that I was doing, now I don't do it, I'm old, I'm sick, okay, spiritually
 this was what happened, at some point maybe we were better, in better shape and we began
 something, but then because of this sickness, these viruses that are coming into us spiritually,
 we are now weak and unable to do those things, we are fat, okay, spiritually, now we need
 to get the shape, okay, we need to gain back the spiritual shape and begin with those projects
 and the Lord, maybe he will bless us and this time we'll succeed, okay, so first of all,
 we think about this, what kind of projects, okay, every day we need to have some advance,
 okay, not just sitting there, okay, in the life, every day some step towards some goal
 in this spiritual warfare and in this ministry, external ministry, some things the Orthodox
 can do is to help more in the church, ask the priest, what kind of initiatives there
 are, maybe he can give you advice, you can join some group, okay, be ready to do things
 that you don't have experience, that you don't know how to do, it's maybe not interesting,
 seems to be something weird, no, just do it, okay, just try, okay, because in that team
 in with the blessing, with some other people joining, you will have a better team and better
 results, okay, that would be nice, also maybe there are some social initiatives, okay, some
 social work, we need to kill that spirit of selfishness, oh, it's my time, it's my safety,
 my something, no, just forget about it, okay, just throw it out, there are people volunteering,
 going to some elderly house, orphanage, somewhere else, doing some stuff, just join, just go
 and do things with them, that would be nice, another way is to self-educate, study, to
 learn more, not for myself, my own growth and putting on my resume that I have some
 degree, certificate, no, forget about your resume, do it for the Lord, so that you will
 be able to share all this knowledge with others, skills, knowledge, whatever, okay, this is
 great motivation, it will keep you motivated, running, you learn some stuff, it will organize
 your life, okay, maybe some media projects, maybe you can do also some sharing in Facebook,
 in YouTube, somewhere else, in some forums, something about faith, about Christianity,
 about life, something healthy and positive, okay, maybe you have talents in that, you
 just need to try with missionary focus, that would be even greater, or anything related
 to faith and spiritual life, maybe some publication projects, people don't read too much these
 days but still they read, maybe some bulletins or some books, some little brochures, that's
 also very nice, organizing, organizing some activities, pilgrimage, something with your
 friends, faithful, Orthodox Christians, Orthodox Christians, just organize something, maybe
 a picnic together, maybe some celebration of some feast, okay, something, lectures,
 any activity, that would be nice, we need more activities, and of course help to those
 who need, okay, those orphans and projects, the spirit of that that I've mentioned, maybe
 you can find yourself in that, okay, so let us think about these things, let us be more
 active, our small little project, it just goes across all plans of the devil, the devil
 is trying to have some big projects, trends, we don't care, we should know about it, okay,
 what is going on, but we should just keep our own little projects running, going forth,
 okay, that's our spirit, we are autonomous spiritually, we don't have his control, spiritual
 control over us, and we just keep going, doing our small projects, go, and it will be very
 important for the Lord, may the Lord help us, give us this strength, this health, this
 faith, and eagerness to do work for his glory, in his name I mean, may the Lord bless you
 and help every one of you, I mean.
