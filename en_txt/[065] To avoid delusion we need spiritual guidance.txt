 Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about a spiritual
 superior or leader that can help us on our path to faith to the kingdom of heaven. And these days
 many people complain that there are not so many people. They cannot find anyone who can help them
 on this path. Because to help us love Christ we need to meet someone who also loves Christ
 and who is obsessed about Christ. And people like that are so few that we sometimes get upset and
 we say well the Christian faith is just okay it's just to believe in something and to pray to maybe
 go sometimes some pilgrimage to some holy places to read some books about faith theology and that's
 that's about it. But Christian faith is about being separate from ordinary life to forget about our
 own self and to crave for the kingdom of heaven from morning till night to be really so much eager
 to search Christ in everywhere to be willing to exert tremendous efforts in our
 willingness to bring more fruits to accumulate greater treasures in heavens.
 And to have this we need some really good example if someone is like that already. And
 to see how does he look at things how does he manage some normal people's problems in
 his life. So that we can also manage these problems. Some people say well I don't need
 any spiritual leader because I have the book the bible and this is enough. I just learn from the
 bible and I learn Christ directly. I don't need anyone else. Well the problem is that there are
 so many different even big groups who have their own understanding of the bible. And if we read just
 ourselves bible we read it five times fifty times we will reach some limit of understanding
 because it will be just our mind and we will not become what I've just described so much possessed
 about loving Christ. For us it will be yes okay I've read it many times I know what did Jesus
 say what he's done and that's it okay. And we will also be maybe if we don't become really
 crazy heretics okay believing some weird things some fantasies that we make we also become quite
 cool okay not hot in our faith okay. So we can see from the history of the Christian church
 from the very beginning we see that Christ himself he was the example for the apostles they had his
 his words in their ears they saw him they saw him after the resurrection and he spoke to them the
 words of truth and they received the Holy Spirit which also taught them directly the wisdom from
 God and they went to the ends of the world witnessing and testifying during their testimony
 about Christ and they lived with this faith from morning till night this was the content of their
 life okay and they done testimony to their other people and it was the second generation of
 Christians okay Saint Peter he taught Saint Mark okay then Saint all he taught Luke and Timothy and
 Titus and others okay and they learned to love Christ through these powerful spiritual
 apostles leaders that they saw in front of them that they had personal relationship with
 and then it was the third generation for example Saint Apostle John first generation and the second
 generation is Saint Ignatius of Antioch the Bishop of Antioch he become martyr and Saint Ignatius
 became a teacher a spiritual leader for Saint Polycarp the Bishop of Smyrna and it is already
 third generation and we see from the writings of apostle Saint Apostle Paul he says that remember
 your teachers in faith and try to follow their example in loving Christ in ministry in testimony
 witnessing this faith so this was very important to have someone who help you to be connected with
 Christ he would not draw attention to him self but to Christ and would really open up this way of life
 living for Christ and with Christ okay so this is the goal of a spiritual leader that we need
 and that we are seeking for okay it is not to place our responsibility upon him okay some people
 they they are afraid of any kind of responsibility so they want someone to tell them okay you do this
 you do that okay now you do this and then he says well it's my spiritual father he told me so it's
 from God so I do it like that and it's not my responsibility okay this way to escape responsibility
 is not the purpose okay and it's harmful actually so we need to be able to take upon ourselves full
 responsibility for what we do for what we choose for what we decide the purpose of spiritual
 father is not that the purpose is to open up to give us this eagerness this drive for this
 motivation this strong motivation of following Christ putting him in the center and
 teaching us how to see other things okay if we have such a heart when we have such a heart
 but to avoid mistakes and to avoid being dragged our attention being dragged by something else okay
 because now the church has existed for 2 000 years and we have a great wealth of spiritual treasures
 okay we have very spiritual prayers we have many saints and many holy relics and we have
 the beautiful liturgy and deep theological discourse and this is all very much helpful
 and important but sometimes because of so much wealth people are losing the focus
 okay and the focus is on Christ has to be on Christ okay and for us not to lose this focus
 we need a spiritual leader spiritual father and what do we do if we don't find one okay
 because in modern times okay we don't find saint polikar okay or saint ignatius or saint apostle
 paul we don't find them like alive right now we can read their books but we we don't find them
 alive in this modern situation we need basically we need two spiritual uh guides okay uh that will
 help us to find Christ okay it's the purpose always is Christ himself okay so all this is
 only for us not to be dragged away to be grounded okay in in some sense to the holy church to the
 body of Christ and one of these two okay should be some living person alive okay the person who is
 in the church who is has strong faith who is grounded to the church life okay and who can
 always help us avoid being dragged away by something okay because this there is always
 a risk if we just read books even if it's the bible okay if we only read books we can be dragged
 astray and we will be dragged so we need someone physical who whom we know whom we trust whom we
 can communicate talk about our life to see his life her life okay and to help us avoid big errors
 in faith okay but this may be not enough because now it's very difficult to find such a person who
 is completely crazy about Christ okay from morning till night is thinking is working for Christ it is
 now very difficult to find anyone like the we see in the apostolic age and later so we need to find
 some saint so the the second spiritual father that we need to find has to be a saint okay and
 this saint who wrote a lot of stuff okay so that we can read these spiritual books and literature
 and they will would help us to love Christ to learn how to love Christ in everything okay to
 to treat many things in the Christian way okay and not just in my own understanding
 so such spiritual people we have not few not many we have them okay so for example in the more
 ancient times saint john the chrysostom he wrote it's 12 volumes he wrote a lot of
 he discusses a lot of issues and from him we can draw this motivation we can
 really see how he loves Christ how does he see Christ everywhere and he's driven by Christ in
 his life okay in a more modern times we can also find for example in the 19th century we have saint
 ignatius the branch in enough and we have saint theophan the recluse the two russian saints great
 spiritual teachers that also wrote many volumes of books about the spiritual life about about
 how they see the world okay so we cannot just from morning to night only read gospel okay
 we we we should but most people they cannot do it okay so for us of course the main book is
 the gospel and then it's the whole scripture okay this is the main reading but to help us apply
 this to our life we need also spiritual literature guidance that we can get from such saints as i'm
 mentioning and in the 20th century we also have saint nicholas of serbia great saint saint lucas
 luca of cremia okay he is a doctor and he also wrote a lot of things and there are more okay but
 i think it is enough to have at least one the one that you really enjoy reading okay even sometimes
 maybe it's not easy reading but we see that this is coming from god okay we will feel it
 okay we will feel it that he is telling me the right thing okay which is coming from christ
 and he is teaching me to love christ okay without any distortion without any mistake so we need to
 find two spiritual people one alive living person in our days in our life okay another one would be
 a saint who can help us and like this we can build a stable and a good spiritual life okay
 and learn how to really love christ and not to be this warm okay not cold not hot warm okay this is
 the biggest risk it's becoming uh well yes i believe um okay i live i try to live like christ
 no this is this is almost nothing okay because if we don't here christ himself said
 if you don't lose your soul you don't gain it and if you gain your soul your life you will
 lose it okay we need to learn how to lose our life how to sacrifice our life our soul our self
 for christ we need to he said whoever will not hate this world and even his own life
 will not love me so we need to learn what does it mean to hate this world okay what does it mean
 saints can teach us help us and with the grace of god with his mighty hand we can
 achieve this in our lives in our hearts may the lord help us don't make like modern priests even
 like in youtube like this blogger priest your spiritual leaders okay very often this is okay
 this can help okay but uh something that really ground us is a saint already recognized he who
 walked this uh path okay who conquered devil who conquered all passions we modern people we we we
 still have a lot of passions okay we're still quite sinful okay so we can just help somewhat
 but a saint would really help us a lot and we can also ask him to pray for us so may the lord
 help you on this path and give you wisdom give you strength and give you this great
 motivation and eagerness in following christ in your life i mean god bless
