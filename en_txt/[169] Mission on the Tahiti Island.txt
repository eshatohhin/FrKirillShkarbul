 Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in the south part of the Tahiti island.
 Today we've made a round circle around Tahiti.
 One woman, she offered to take me around the whole island.
 And we've met with many people, we've given out leaflets.
 Behind me is a waterfall, it's called Three Waterfalls Place, one of the waterfalls, you can see.
 Well, we hope that, like the water of life, the good news will be springing here, and many people will become overlords.
 Glory to God!
