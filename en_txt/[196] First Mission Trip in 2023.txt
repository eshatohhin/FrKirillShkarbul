 Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm on my way to Belize.
 It's a country in Central America, which doesn't have an Orthodox mission yet.
 I'm now transferring in Mexico, in Cancun City.
 And then it's a short flight, about one and a half hours from here.
 And a small plane, only 19 people.
 And I'm going there.
 Actually, I've been to Belize once, that was about 11 years ago.
 And it's a really very undeveloped country.
 The roads, the shops, the hotels, everything there is maybe 20 times less
 than in the neighboring Mexico province.
 So you really feel the difference, once you cross the border.
 Last time I went by car, this time I'm flying.
 But it's really quite desolate, not many people.
 And not many people want to live there, want to go there.
 Maybe that's one of the reasons why there is no mission yet.
 But even though there is a mission like everywhere in Central America,
 in South America, only two places.
 This is one of the places which doesn't have a mission.
 So I'm really hopeful that we can establish a mission there.
 I made a lot of brochures.
 I took some crosses, icons, prayer ropes.
 Please pray that the mission of the Church can develop.
 That this year we can start off with the good results,
 with fruits of the Holy Spirit here in this area,
 this area which was quite desolate for centuries.
 It's considered the place where people lived for refuge from Mexico,
 from Guatemala, Honduras, the world wars, revolts from the United States.
 It's really the outskirts of the world.
 They call themselves the end of the world, the age of the world.
 Well, we'll see how it goes.
 I'm asking for your prayers, for your support,
 and I hope everything goes well.
 I will tell you more once I get there.
 May God give us his joy and give us his blessing.
 I mean, God bless.
