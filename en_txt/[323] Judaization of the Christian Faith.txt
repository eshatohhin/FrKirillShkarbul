Dear brothers and sisters, after we make the decision to follow Christ, there are many dangers, many threats waiting on the way, and many people are being diverted. This is why we have maybe 50,000, maybe more different sects and heresies, which tells us that there are ways to be deceived. It's not like Protestants say that you believe and you're safe, hallelujah. 

The main problem, the main virus which comes and takes different shapes and forms is the virus of Judaism, Judaizers. I had a video on that, but today I want to be more precise on how it can damage, it can spoil the spirituality, the relationship between man and Christ, and how people become heretics. And even people within the church, okay, they remain Orthodox, but they have heretic mentality, okay, or pagan mentality. 

There are different ways of going astray. Today I want to tell you about three main phenomena which we need to be aware of. And once we talk about Judaizers, Judaizing Christianity, we will come back to this question of Old Testament and New Testament, okay, what is the significance of the Old Testament, okay. 

And to begin today's topic, I want to cite Apostle Paul, okay, who said to the Galatians, to Christians in Galatians, to Galatia, he told them, that's Galatians 4.11, I am afraid for you, lest I have labored amongst you in vain. He went there, he preached there, he made them Christians, they believed in Christ, okay, but he doesn't say, you believe, you're safe, hallelujah. No, he tells them that it looks like you're already, it's all in vain, okay, it's all in vain. 

Okay, so we don't want the Lord to say these things to us or to the Apostles, okay, so we should not relax and think that, okay, I'm Christian, I'm baptized, everything is fine. Yes, I believe in the creed and everything, Holy Father said, whatever they say, I believe that, I endorse that, okay, it doesn't work like that. So, these three problems which we have these days, okay, the first problem is the problem of ritual and some rules, some external behavior rules, okay, that tell you do this, don't do this, okay, these rules pertaining to, oh, okay, fasting and some other different rules, okay, blessings and many other things, okay, some people take it absolute, they think that these rules and rituals and the divine service is absolute and they have this old ritualist mentality, maybe you know there was this old ritualist schism in Russia in the 17th century, okay, when people, some people, they were so particular about every single letter in the texts, okay, that there was a split and they even burned themselves for that reason, okay, but, okay, I'm not gonna talk about this right now, but the problem is the rituals were absolute for the Old Testament times, okay, and they were not really absolute but they were of great importance because there was not yet a real union with Christ, okay, it was still impossible, okay, the Lord hasn't come yet, had not come yet and he could not make them receive his true body and true blood, okay, at that time they were waiting for Messiah and it's because of that expectation, that hope for Messiah they were able to approach God, to get closer to God, okay, to have some revelations, the prophets, but that was all not enough, okay, so to put it in a simple words and Apostle Paul does it much better in Hebrews, you can read about it, that the Old Testament is all about flesh, okay, it's all about material stuff, it's all about do this, don't do this, okay, the temple, okay, you have temple, how big should be the temple, this, that, the Holy of the Holies, make it this way, okay, detailed instructions about everything, so it was given by God at some point, but that was all for that period so that they can prepare for Christ and Apostle Paul tells us exactly that the Old Testament was unable to make anyone perfect, okay, it was showing the direction towards this perfection and righteousness, but it was unable to make you perfect, because it's only in Jesus Christ, in union with him, in receiving the Holy Eucharist you can become perfect, because you can be one with God, okay, but at that time it was impossible, but that was all they had, these rituals, these liturgies and all these things, that was all they had, okay, so during the apostolic times, okay, there was great freedom of the forms which the divine service took, okay, they had these gatherings at home breaking the breads and it also had its own order, okay, Apostle Paul says don't make it just chaos, okay, you have to have it in order, okay, of piety, of respect towards the Lord, it has to be all very neat and fine, but the form was secondary, the main thing is you be one with Christ, the main thing is your spiritual union with the living Christ, this mystical union, okay, so what parable I can use, for example, let's say you have a love relationship, okay, you love someone, if you truly love each other, you won't really need some formal, okay, on every month, okay, on the first of every month I need to do something, I need to, okay, give her flowers or I give, there is no formalization, okay, it's very natural, okay, and both of you know from this, from this inner intuition about this love that there is among you, but once it becomes, okay, less, you will need some, let's say, safety net, okay, that, okay, flower, okay, don't forget I love you, okay, we need some things like this, but later if this love keeps decreasing, it will be a surrogate, okay, you will give this flower, but you don't have any love at all, and the person will know it, okay, so it becomes like a some surrogate, okay, simulacra, okay, it is something, it is pretending to be something, but it's not, okay, so sometimes as soon as we replace this love relationship with God, with ritual, with liturgy, with, you know, some forms, some decorations, if we lose this love towards God, this is all fake, this is all simulacra, this is all just museum, and as a matter of fact, if you go to these schismatic churches, you can feel that spirit of museum, it's just museum, they pretend to be church, but it's not, there is no God inside those churches, okay, so this is something to pay attention to, okay, not to over rely on any material stuff, at the same time, of course, we don't sleep into the opposite, okay, the opposite is liberalism, which says, we don't need anything, we don't need anything, just hallelujah, just praise the Lord, so we don't need the church, we don't need the liturgy, we don't need the sacraments, we don't need the priests, we don't need anything, okay, because it's free love towards God, okay, but at the end of the day, it becomes just demon possession, okay, just complete split off of any spirituality, of any piety, okay, of any Christianity, okay, it becomes just a monster, why, why does that happen, why as soon as people nowadays depart from the forms that we have in the church, they sleep into that, why they could be so flexible in the early church, okay, well, because in the early church, they were much closer, these apostles, I'm not talking about all the people, but the apostles who've taught the church and who were the leaders of the church, they were much closer to God, okay, that most of the church leaders nowadays, okay, nowadays, maybe regular faithful are closer to God than some of the church leaders, okay, in those days, these apostles, they were persecuted, okay, they they struggled so much to be loyal to Christ, okay, they were fearless going to all kinds of places, foreign countries, into very dangerous places, and they witnessed, they preached about Christ, and most of them were martyred, almost all of them, okay, in those situations, okay, you do discover what does it mean to rely on Christ, what does it mean to be honest to Christ, to be loyal to Him, not to have compromised, okay, not to be conformist to this world and to the spirit of this world, and all these people in power and other things of this world, teachings, philosophies, and everything else, okay, so that was the time of the apostles, but nowadays, people are far away, and they just have this spirit of ham that I want to be different, I think I know better, so I don't like church, how the church does it, I'll do it better, okay, and this spirit of revolutionary, okay, it's coming from devil, from flesh, okay, it doesn't bring people to Christ, and that's why all these liberalists, they fall into this trap, and they are just proud and blind, usually demon-possessed people, okay, other problems which we have, other two big problems that we have, which are related to this, okay, which is also related to this going back to Old Testament mentality, okay, the first one is the, this, I mean, the second already, the second is being too close to the rulers, and for that reason, okay, for that reason, not having this testimony, not having this testimony of the truth, okay, this friendship with the world, okay, it is relying on all kinds of secular ways of running things, okay, it's when the church becomes an institution, when it relies on bureaucracy, okay, when it becomes like a worldly organization, okay, of course, we need some kind of organization, but the church as it's established by Christ is the projection of the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of God is a kingdom, but it's not like worldly kingdom, okay, it's not the Louis XIV kingdom, okay, or tsar in Russian, okay, it's a kingdom that is fully based on love, on love, on respect, on mutual trust, okay, on sincerity, it's not based on power, it's not based on, you know, administrative structure, so that it's based on mutual self-sacrifice, okay, the monarch Christ is sacrificing himself for the church, and this is why we, the church, sacrifice ourselves for him and for others, and that's not what happens with these worldly institutions, okay, and not only with monarchies or dictatorships, it's same with democracy, okay, some churches, they follow like democratic thing, they think it's more Christian, it's not more Christian, it's also based on these rules and laws, external ones, okay, how many votes, what is the quorum, or what is our constitution, who is present, who is not present, we vote, we revote, okay, all this stuff, okay, it doesn't have any love in that, it's just bureaucracy, so be it like transparent, flat bureaucracy, or more vertical, more totalitarian, it's all worldly things, and the church is not that, okay, so whenever we have that, it's also slipping back to the Old Testament, okay, because in the Old Testament that was the problem, okay, that's what Christ was criticizing, because those pharisees, those rulers, sadducees, and priests, and scribes, they've grasped the power, okay, and they said just listen to us, they were not busy with teaching the people the law of God, and how to repent, and how to find the kingdom of God, no, they were busy with controlling this population, okay, and same thing happened with the Catholics, okay, the Rome, it split away because of that, that was the reason, power, okay, control, I tell you to go, crusades, okay, don't ask me why, I know, okay, I know, Christ told me, so just go and kill those people, okay, and many other examples, okay, so that became a clear example, we don't want to slip into that, okay, we see how these Protestant churches in Europe all became departments of government, okay, run by clerks, and, you know, collecting taxes, and has nothing to do with the Church of Christ, okay, the Church of Christ is not just dogma, it believes on dogma, no, so that is all Judaism, okay, and even if we have some small, you have, let's say, some small church in, I don't know, in the States, or somewhere, which is not really part of the government, it will be also just, like, almost like a enterprise, you know, like, incorporated, okay, church incorporated, so this is not what we want the church to be like, okay, and the last one, which is also related to this so much, is the friendship with the government, okay, from the 4th century, of course, the church had to deal with this government, in the sense that the government said, okay, we will help you, we are also Christian, so what can we do now together, and the church could not refuse that, it helped the church mission-wise, and to teach the people many things, but over every time, every century, there was this risk, because you are coming too close to what? To the throne of the prince of this world. 

In the book of Revelation, we read that there is this altar of Satan, you leave where the altar of Satan is, and that altar of Satan, the fathers, they interpret as the secular power, okay, because the secular power is always about power, it's always about influence, okay, it always has a worldly agenda, so if you become too close to it, you will become, you know, you will have to follow that agenda, so most of the time, the church was able to distance itself from that, okay, and to preserve itself as the church of Christ, okay, to be faithful to Christ, despite these attempts to cooperate somehow, okay, but there is always this risk, and we need to be cautious of it, and this gives birth to all kinds of things, like imperialism, patriotism, a holy land, now our country is a holy land, we need to protect it, we need to defend it, okay, so just take the arms, take the weapons, missiles, and go and fight, so what is this like? This is like the first century Judea, those zealots, most of those Jews in the times of Christ, they were all possessed with those nationalistic patriotic ideas, and they had even more grounds for them, because at that time, they could say this was given, this land is given by God to us, so we need to die for this land, we need to kick out all these Romans from here, that was more logical than what we have now, but nevertheless, they were not blessed by God, and Christ never supported those things, all of those claims, those ambitions, and they were destroyed, utterly destroyed, we know about that, okay, so all of that was an example for all of us, a lesson, not to be involved in those agendas, okay, let other people, okay, there will be plenty of people, I'm telling you, plenty of people who are willing to be paid to go to war, to kill and to be killed, there will be plenty, they just take money and sell their lives, okay, and there will be plenty who are brainwashed by television and by other stuff, okay, by all kinds of propaganda, and maybe we have a bigger war coming, okay, so that it's going to affect everyone, we need to be ready for that, brothers and sisters, we need to be loyal to Christ, you truly want to spread the kingdom of God, you truly want to do something good for Christ, go and tell others about it, go and pray and develop your spiritual life to be closer to God, it's much easier to just take a machine gun and go and kill and, okay, and then be killed next day, okay, it's much easier, you don't need much brain for that, okay, but if you really want to follow the narrow path, you want to be responsible for the life that God has given to you, okay, go and preach the gospel and be a witness of love, not a witness of some slogans, okay, political, patriotic, whatever, okay, there will be plenty of people who are willing to do that, don't worry, so let us, brothers and sisters, let us have repentant hearts, let us remember always that it's our dialogue with God, it's our living faith, it's our true trust in Christ, okay, that can make us citizens of the heavens, of the kingdom of heaven, heirs of the kingdom of heaven, and it's not either some rituals like those Pharisees, okay, you wash these benches and cauldrons, and so you are purified, not those things, okay, not those external things, everything that we have, everything we have decoration in the church, we have divine liturgy, it's helping you to find the spiritual, what is behind it, it's not by itself the end, okay, it's just the means for you to penetrate in that mystery, because you are still carnal, it's more mission-oriented rather than the true source of spirituality, the true source of life is Christ himself, the living God, who can be with you in the forest where you don't have anything, you don't have a church, you don't have icons, you don't have anything, but he will be closer to you, but as a whole we do need, okay, we respect these fruits of the life in the Holy Spirit that the church had, which brought these forms which we have now of divine service and of church structure, okay, we have priests, bishops, deacons, but it's not administrative, okay, it's according to the kingdom of God, okay, which is hierarchical, but it's still, it's a family, okay, may the Lord give us his blessing, give us his wisdom, give us hearts which love him above everything else and not to be drawn by any spirit of this world, okay, and today what I've said, I don't want to accuse anyone, okay, I don't want you to accuse people who adhere to these kind of ideas, okay, who are we? we are repenting sinners who are much worse than anyone else, okay, so we're not accusing, but we are, we need to be aware of all these risks and mistakes, I mean, may the Lord bless every, each and every one of you, I mean, God bless.
