 Dear friends, today is a windy weather but we still keep going with our videos and today's topic is
 God as a mystery because very often we think that we can know everything about God and we
 already know everything about God and this is the risky thing because when we think we know
 everything about say a person say our wife or someone okay then we lose interest okay or teacher
 okay when we think that okay I know everything already what he says and then we lose interest
 and we cannot really learn anything else from him and this also what brought development of science
 because for the science the assumption is that there is so much out there that we don't know
 that we keep doing research okay and the science never says okay now I know everything
 okay and most things are theories okay we have relativity theory and other theories it's not
 considered that it's final okay this is how it is so that makes science have the potential
 to develop more and more and the more it discovers it understands that the more ignorant it is
 the more things out there that it doesn't yet know so this frontier of science always expands
 so in the same way our frontier of understanding of God has to expand all the time okay we also
 remember that the whole development of civilization in the ancient times in classical ancient times
 the whole growth of philosophy in Greece is marked by the attitude of Socrates who said that
 I know that I don't know anything okay this is in Christianity this is called humbleness
 and pouring spirit blessed are the pouring spirit if we don't have any conclusions okay I know this
 this I everything I understand we have true humbleness and the Lord can give us more and more
 if we are already already filled we know things we know who we are we know our abilities and
 everything else there is nothing else can come in okay we're already filled we think that we
 are filled even though we're empty we all all this what we're filled with it's it's nothing
 basically so today I want to say a few words about God as mystery because in the western
 theological tradition after the middle ages there was well during the middle ages the
 development of theology is marked by scholasticism okay in the catholic church after the split
 already with the orthodox there was this development a tremendous development of
 scholasticism what is scholastics scholasticism is the approach to use logic and knowledge
 to understand who is God what is God okay the accidents the nature of God the properties and
 to develop a theory okay like a scientific theory of of God okay and holiness to have everything
 clearly understood okay analyzed okay and if you analyze a lot okay this comes also from Spain
 okay during from 8th century there was this schooling in Spain where analysis was very
 important many people in the west they received their education in those schools from the Arabs
 and and they taught them Aristotle and analysis and many other things okay and if you analyze
 something too much okay you lose love towards the object that you analyze okay so for example if
 you analyze your spouse say if you understand everything or for yourself you make a conclusion
 that okay now I understand everything about my spouse okay or my say teacher professor I know
 everything he talks about okay then we lose interest and we lose love so this brought the
 whole western world to this crisis okay the crisis that okay now we've described God we
 know everything about God and so what so what these are just some concepts okay now we we know
 everything about it okay we we are not interested anymore okay so there was a decline in the
 religious life in the west and there was were attempts to recover it through other ways like
 franciscan using compassion and other things to try to stir up the emotions and to and to
 recover this religious feeling okay but in the church this was not a problem because
 it was always understand understood that God is a mystery okay in the Hebrew language it's called
 sod okay the mystery that is in Torah okay in the law of God and this is the mystery that we need to
 grasp we need to be united with in order to understand so for for us and Christ is telling
 about this in gospel of mark in chapter four he is teaching those who are outside who don't follow
 him he's teaching them with parables but only to the disciples he is explaining those parables okay
 and this is not because he was discriminating but because he knew that only disciples can understand
 that meaning and can remember that meaning and use that meaning in their lives so in the same way we
 can understand the true law of God the wisdom of God only by following him only by implementing
 his commandments in our lives and then that can make us knowledgeable and wise drawing from his
 revelation from his wisdom he will reveal himself to us and the closer we are to him the more he
 will reveal himself okay so if there is some professor or some okay scholar theologian who
 says okay I've read everything about Christianity I know about all the teachers of Christianity
 I've read Bible many times and many commentaries on Bible and okay I know all you guys talking
 about I'm not Christian myself I'm say atheist or some other religion but I know everything
 maybe better than you do okay okay this is a shame for us that that we don't know our faith that much
 okay we don't put effort into learning about gospel and scripture but the difference is that
 for him all of that is external that's external knowledge it's not so much important for faith
 but for faith it is important to be united with God and that he reveals the kingdom of heaven to us
 okay so in science it is the knowledge that we have okay that gives us a clue to the mysteries
 of this physical world but in religion in faith it is our faith okay our faith that changes us
 okay faith is not we just believe it's changing our lives according to our faith that gives us the
 key to knowing more about God okay so let us learn how to use this key and let us not think that this
 is similar to occultism or esoterics okay we know that this was a big it still is okay many people
 are interested in this kind of stuff astrology and all kinds of spells and other mystical things
 some knowledge from kabbalah from tibet dalai lama or something like that okay that will give
 you some super powers super knowledge all of that is contrary to God's will okay because all of that
 is not given to us by God and it's given to us by the evil powers okay by the devil and we
 try to be like God like a monkey okay of God okay without God without humbleness without
 Christian virtues just grasping some super powers to be able to okay no future or to
 to set the clouds apart okay different kinds of occult things or to go to astral to to okay
 to read mind of other people other things okay all of that is against God's will even though
 many people come to faith through this okay many people they begin searching searching first they
 find some esoteric books and they read it and they they are involved in that but later they understand
 okay that there is something wrong with it and then they repent and then they find true God
 okay and they throw this away and begin true faith path to the God in the right way and grow
 spiritually so may the Lord help us give us wisdom not to be atheist okay not to have this feeling
 that I know everything and not to have this involvement in those demonic and evil practices
 because it's only with God with his blessing with union with Christ that we can receive revelation
 from the from the Lord and grow in faith and to inherit his kingdom and he can give us tremendous
 strength to withstand any kind of spell any kind of demonic influence whatever he the the true
 strength and power comes only from God himself and we can have it only through humbleness
 living according to the gospel changing ourselves and receiving the grace and power from God I mean
 may Lord give us this wisdom and help us on this path and protect us from any mistake
 and any wrong direction wrong practice God bless
