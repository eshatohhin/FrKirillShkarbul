 Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church has entered into the Great Land, and we need
 to thank the Lord for this opportunity to gain sight, to gain life.
 We discover that we are blind and dead spiritually, and that we need to come again to our beloved
 Father, to turn to Him, to turn away from all this worldly busyness, from all this immersion
 into the life of Mammon, we want to gain our true homeland, which is the Kingdom of Heaven.
 Regarding the Great Land, there are two big mistakes that people make.
 One mistake, only one side, is people take it formally, that we need to obey these rules,
 don't eat this, eat this, read this prayer, and we just do it and this is fine, this is
 enough.
 Well, this results in a spirit of Pharisee, that people have vain glory and they think
 that this is everything, but they are as evil, as wicked, as proud as they always were.
 So nothing changes, they get worse, they become like those who fight with the Lord, like those
 Pharisees who pretend that they are righteous, externally they are righteous, but internally
 they are full of all kinds of filthiness.
 Another big problem that we have is on the other extreme, people say that we are spiritual,
 we are not Pharisees, so it is all about talking to the Lord and being very spiritual,
 but regarding this land, what you eat, what you don't eat, don't forget, don't think about
 too much, don't worry, don't do harm to your neighbor, don't do evil things, and stuff
 like this, basically this is a very tricky way to find excuse for your gluttony, or for
 your spiritual idleness, slothfulness.
 So both of these views are very wrong, they seem to be right, but both are wrong.
 Well what is right, not many Christians, well even Orthodox Christians, I am not talking
 about people who are outside of the church, where there is almost no fasting, so they
 surrender to evil already, they live in illusion, about God, about gospel, it is all about illusion,
 there is no real communication with the Lord.
 But even within the Orthodox Church, there are not that many people who fast, unfortunately,
 because people don't understand how it works, because they have bad examples, lack of pastoral
 care, many reasons.
 So today I hope we can all look back into the Holy Gospel, look back into the Holy Fathers,
 and see what they have to tell us about the land which we are now entering.
 First of all, before I go into this, I want to say that the early Christians, they enjoyed
 the land, they were expecting the land to come, because they saw this great spiritual
 advantage, benefit, that they are gaining in this land, they saw that they live their Christian
 vocation, their calling during the land to its most, this is like you say you are a doctor,
 but you don't have any work, you just sit in the hospital, you don't do anything.
 It's losing meaning, you become gloomy, because this is not what you were studying, 20 years,
 you wanted to become a doctor to heal people, same for, I don't know, soldiers, firefighters,
 anything, people who go to some profession by calling, not just for money, because they
 have this calling, when there is nothing to do, they get upset.
 So this is the time when we gain this eagerness, this enthusiasm, now are these holy days,
 and the Lord is blessing me, and the whole church is fighting with the evil during this
 time and we are all coming into this spiritual renewal, rebirth together during this land.
 So this is why there are so many fasting days in the Orthodox Church.
 So we have to kill this pharaoh inside us, we need to change our brain, the way we look
 at fast, because our brain comes from the old self, which tells us, oh now you cannot
 eat this, this, your tasty stuff, so you suffer, it's difficult, when is it going to end, your
 counting days.
 This is old man, this is pharaoh or kain, who killed his brother, he is living inside
 you, this spiritual pharaoh, this mamo, he is living inside you, inside me, inside everyone,
 when we have thoughts like this.
 So let us drop all those thoughts and have a fresh look at what we are about to go through.
 And also in Matthew chapter 6, 17, 18, we read that you need to oil your head and wash
 your face when you fast, not to look gloomy like those Pharisees and hypocrites, no, you
 need to be joyful, you need to be bright when you meet others, because your fast is internal,
 it's not on your face, you make people sad because they know you are fasting, it's a
 difficult time you are going through, no, nobody has to know.
 When it's in secret, then it's going to be accepted by the Lord.
 No matter if you pray, it has to be in secret, if you do deeds of mercy, it has to be in
 secret, when you fast, it also has to be in secret, and it used to be like the gospel
 gives us joy, that's how we fast, we don't fast like the Jews, Pharisees, who are gloomy
 and they put ash and everybody could see them, and stuff like this, no, for us, is the fasting
 of the gospel.
 Well let's see what the saints are saying, St. Basil the Great, first of all he is telling
 us that angels take note, they have a record of everyone who is fasting.
 So say the church, 100 people, they look, who is fasting, only those 5, we take a note,
 these 5, they are ready to sacrifice something because they love the Lord, everybody else
 is slothful, doesn't do anything, doesn't bring any fruit, lazy serves mamma, even though
 they come to church.
 So this is one thing, another thing, in 1 Corinthians 9.25, the apostle Paul, he says
 this, whoever is doing, is laboring for the Lord, he is abstaining from everything, I'm
 using my words, so if we want to take the cross of Christ, we need to abstain from everything,
 from every carnal enjoyment, we need to constrain our will, our thoughts, our intentions, our
 desires, everything, we need to have this mastery, this is when our news, our spiritual
 mind is the Lord, when we can control even our thoughts.
 If we want to go to this narrow path, which is very hard to walk, very few walk this path,
 and we need to enter into the narrow gate, where even a camel cannot go through the ear
 of a needle, in the same way the rich man cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven, and
 we all are rich, we are rich by our desires, our possessions, our selfishness, this is
 what we are rich with, and with all this luggage that we have, we will not be able
 to enter into this gate, so let us during this last, throw this out, empty our gate
 stock, all this luggage, all this burden of earthly cares, desires, habits that we have,
 we need to rip ourselves of all this stuff, so that our heart can be together with the
 Lord, so St. Basil tells that a land will strengthen those who labor for the Lord, it's
 not food that will give them strength, it's the land, it's abstaining from food which
 will give them strength, this is not logical, but this is how it works, okay, another thing
 that St. Basil is telling us is that how much you will take away from your flesh by abstaining
 from some food or some other enjoyment, so much you will give to the soul, you will obtain
 grace from the Lord, you will receive this spiritual food, this spiritual joy, not carnal
 joy, instead of carnal joy, you will receive this spiritual joy, and we read about this
 in Galatians 5 17, where Apostle Paul says that flesh wants what is in enmity, what is
 against the spirit, and the spirit wants what's against the flesh, so the spirit wants you
 to fast, which is against the flesh, but the flesh wants pleasure, enjoyment, relaxation
 and all other stuff, so there is this enmity between them, if we want to live according
 to the spirit and not according to the flesh, we have to be strict on our flesh, and some
 fathers say that true fasting is not just you eat this, you don't eat meat, but you
 eat, I don't know, pancakes, or I don't know what you eat, okay, tofu, no, it's when you
 feel some hunger, that's when you really fast, well, we don't have hunger all throughout
 the land, but at least a little bit, we need to have this feeling at least a little bit
 every day, okay, don't eat too full, another thing which St. Basil is saying is that whoever
 has in his heart unconstrained in terms of desires, in any field, I want this, I want
 that, and you don't constrain yourself, your heart becomes an altar of idols, you're worshiping
 idols in your heart, this is scary, okay, because we communicate with the devil, we
 allow devil to enter into our heart and pollute our heart when we don't constrain ourselves,
 and this is what we need to learn during the land, to constrain ourselves, and also he
 is saying that the true land, the true meaning of the land is abstained from evil, it's not
 abstained from food, it's abstained from evil, from all kinds of passions, habits, desires,
 passions, anger, idol talking, okay, you name it, so why food is important, well, food is
 just a basic desire that we have never controlled and we are spoiled in terms of eating a lot,
 eating tasty, okay, all these gluttonous things, this is in every one of us, and it's feeding
 all other passions, okay, all other passions, anger, okay, this greed and everything else,
 it's all fed by the glutton, okay, then Saint Ephraim the Syrian, we're actually reading
 now prayer of Saint Ephraim the Syrian, please find this prayer, we read it every time after
 prayers, morning prayers, evening prayers, prayers during the day, prayer of Saint Ephraim
 the Syrian, please learn it, please use it, so Ephraim the Syrian, he is saying that it
 was using the land, using fasting, that all those prophets and patriarchs in the Old Testament,
 they were doing miracles, they were conquering armies, they were crushing the gates, Samson,
 he crushed those gates in the city, he conquered lions, okay, those three young men were chanting
 in the middle of the furnace, okay, with all this fire burning, but it could not burn them,
 they were chanting, this was when they were fasting, he finds this, okay, he's doing this
 research and he finds that it was fasting which brought this to happen, which tells
 us that fasting is absolutely necessary if we want the power of the Lord to be with us,
 if we want the Lord to be together with us, okay, we want him to participate in our life,
 fasting is the key, okay, also he says that fasting is not compatible with anger, okay,
 he doesn't mention, there are many different sins and passions, but he says anger, okay,
 if you're angry, if you are irritated, you have grudges, you're angry at life, you're
 angry at people, this makes your fasting empty, useless, futile, okay, then there is another
 saint, blessed Mark, the ascetic, it's not the evangelist Mark, it's another desert father,
 he lived in the 5th century, and he says that, okay, when we eat enough, when we eat, we're
 not hungry, okay, we're saturated, okay, we completely satisfy our hunger, things will
 give birth to other desires, okay, otherwise they would not come up, but when you're full,
 they will come, and in the same way you satisfy something else, and some other snakes they
 will come up, there is this spiritual thing, it's inside this satiation, whenever you satisfy
 some passion, immediately some other passion will wake up and will demand something else,
 so we need to be mindful of that, okay, this is what we need to do during the Lent, not
 to satisfy our passions, then also he says that the prayer without fasting is useless,
 prayer without fasting is like you have a field with grass with all kinds of, okay,
 thorns and, you know, wheat growing, and then you're trying to plant seeds, like prayer
 is like planting seeds, these seeds they will not grow, because you have all those wheat
 in there, and you can have any fruits, you can have this pure prayer going to the Lord,
 only when you fast, when you kill all other desires, you abstain from this worldly busyness
 running around all day, okay, we put all other things aside during this time, okay, because
 we really want to have clean unobstructed prayer, and this is when the prayer will work,
 and also the other way around also works, if you fast but you don't pray, no use, because
 it's like having a field, you cultivate the field but you don't plant it, so you don't
 need this field, okay, it's useless, so both fasting and prayer are necessary, also he
 says that the greatest harm from fasting is vainglory, you would have vainglory if there
 is a success, any success in your fasting, because you will attribute it to yourself,
 you have to always remember that it's not up to me if I will succeed or not, my task
 is only to put the effort, and if it works it's not because I'm cool, okay, I'm something,
 no I'm nothing, we are big sinners, if something is successful during our fasting, this is
 only the Lord's grace and blessing, okay, so there is no reason for any vainglory, proudness
 whatsoever.
 So we must avoid this trust in yourself, I can do it, yes, okay, I'll do it, no problem,
 I can fast, I can do without meat, no problem, so it's not a problem for me, this is all
 you know, it's so miserable in front of the Lord, he hates this kind of attitude, this
 Pharisee spirit, and so he concludes Saint Mark, he says that whoever knows the Lord,
 he would know himself, he would see himself, he would understand how miserable he is, so
 this is why repentance is the key to the land, when we repent we understand how miserable,
 how far away from the Lord we are, and this opens our understanding of who we are, and
 then this will bring us communication with the Lord, this will bring us knowing wisdom
 of the Lord, so there is this very important relationship, and he's bringing Job, the book
 of Job chapter 42, 5 to 6, you can read it on your own, what it says there that whoever
 knows the Lord, Job himself, after the Lord shows him the creation and all the wisdom
 of his, he understands that he is so miserable, that he really repents and understands that
 he is nothing, so there is great humbleness, crushing himself, the heart which is crushed,
 the Lord will load the spice, so the Psalms is telling us, so we need to crush our hearts,
 we need to have this feeling all through the great land, deep deep humbleness, understanding
 how far we are from the Lord, we're going through this darkness, this exile, this is
 why the last day before the great land is called the memory of Adam's exile, we are
 in exile, we are in exile because of our sins, and we need to come back to the Lord, we need
 to come back to him, and this is the path of the great land, we need to die for this
 world and be born for the world of the Lord, for his world.
 Also Saint Leo the Great, one of the Holy Fathers, Pope of Rome, in the 5th century,
 he says that the Lord's grace always makes its saints victorious, we're gaining victory
 during the land, however, he says, but it never destroys the labor, the fit of the fight,
 so even though you gain victory, the fight is still going on, because very often we think
 ok, I've reached this, I've done this, I'm victorious, glory to God, I can relax, no,
 if we relax, we fail, so we need to have these victories, every day of the great land have
 victory over my passions, over my desires, with the grace of the Lord we will be victorious,
 but we need to remember that the fight is going on, there is no limit, there is no upper
 limit, ok, don't relax, ok, we still are in this fight, until the last day.
 Also this land should not for us be, well, every year we have a land, it's just some
 special time, then it's going to be another land, so it's just a routine, no, this land
 that we're coming in, we need to perceive it as our first land, that everything that
 was before, it was not serious, it was not enough, this year I'm going to be serious,
 this year I'm going to gain, find the Lord, I will be knocking, I will be searching for
 His truth, this is the chance that He's giving me, ok, now, here, this year, and at the same
 time we should see this land as our last land, last opportunity, we're facing His kingdom
 which is imminent, it's coming, and maybe, who knows, maybe it will be our last land,
 who knows, ok, the holy fathers when they went to desert during the land, they did not
 speak with anyone, ok, to preserve their heart in prayer, they would abstain from any communication,
 from meeting anyone else.
 They went to desert, everyone would be fasting on his own, they had forgiveness before they
 went, they forgive each other, that's why we have forgiveness Sunday, and then they
 went and some of them would not come back, it was a desert, it was, they almost didn't
 eat anything, very few foods, and eventually some of them would not make it, the Lord would
 take them, it's not that they killed themselves, the Lord would take them, it's time for some
 of them to go, so we need, this is how we face it, unless we face it like this, ok,
 we will fail, I think, we won't achieve much.
 Also Saint Ignatius of Brancininov is a great saint of the 19th century, he said that our
 soul is spiritual, our soul is spiritual and we are created by the image of God, ok, so
 our soul first of all is like an angel, ok, we are spiritual first and foremost, our physical
 body is just the instrument that we have, ok, we are spiritual and if we being spiritual
 are interested and focused mainly on the earthly stuff, I am not even talking about sins, ok,
 just earthly, normal regular life, but our focus, our centre of our life is all around
 earthly things, Saint Ignatius tells us that we are polluting, defiling ourselves, our
 souls are intermixed with this earthly, this temporary stuff and we will fall down like
 this falling angel, we will fall down and we will be crushed, ok, we will have enmity
 with the Lord, because we will be driven by flesh and not by the Spirit, so it doesn't
 mean that we don't need to care for our families and for other things that we are supposed
 to care about, but priorities, it's all about priorities, if we are focused on the Lord,
 then everything else will come in its place, ok, during this time, especially during the
 Great Land we set aside many things that normally we need to do to fix this, to do that, now
 we will set it aside, put it aside, nothing major will happen, during this, it's only
 seven weeks of the land, of fasting, nothing major is going to happen if we leave it aside
 for this time, we focus on the spiritual, we focus on prayer, on spiritual reading,
 we need to set goals for the Great Land, what we want to read, the Holy Bible, the Apostles,
 the spiritual literature, we want to pray, we want to learn how to pray, we want to do
 some deeds of mercy, all these things become the concern, the focus of our life every day
 of the land, may the Lord help us, please also read the Great Canon, if you can't go
 to church, please go to church, this week, every night we will be reading this Great
 Canon of St. Andrew of Crete, please read it on your own, if you cannot go to the church,
 there is English text, or you can listen to it, it is a very deep repentance service,
 where we see the journey of the soul back to her creator, her loving father, and we
 want to return to our father and be with him, may the Lord give us such heart, give us this
 love, make us live spiritually, overthrow all the idols, all the passions, be firm on
 this path towards the Lord, may the Lord give you this joy, give you this strength, make
 you victorious on every day of the land, I mean, God bless.
