 Dear brothers and sisters, today I am on another island of French Polynesia, it's called Huahine
 Island. This island is not too far from the main island, from Tahiti, it's about 4 hours
 by ship, so I came here yesterday by ship, and today I want to share with you why I came
 here and about this island, what did I see, and some thinking, some thoughts about preaching,
 about the mission here, about people here. Well, this place is not too far from Tahiti,
 but it's far enough to limit that big amount of tourists coming. The population here is
 only about 6,000 people, whom majority are locals, some foreigners, but not that many,
 and tourists, there are tourists here, but it's not crowded at all. So you see them here
 and there, but there is no town here, there is no city, it's quite small, it's all like
 a village, you can hear the sounds here, the dogs, we have chicken, we have everything
 here. So I decided to come here because I met one person who is from Bora Bora, it's
 not far from here, and he told me about the ship and about these islands, that they are
 very beautiful and quiet, and it's not difficult to come here, just take a boat, it's not as
 expensive as airplane, and the ferry is next door from the place I live in Papeete, Tahiti.
 So I decided to come here Sunday and Monday, there is nothing open, there are no people
 in Papeete, so not much to do in terms of mission, so I decided to come here and to
 see if there are any mission opportunities here. And also I see that my trip is more
 of a preparation for the next trip, I don't think we'll have massive conversions happening
 right now, just on the first trip. So I'm trying to understand different parts of the
 country, different types of islands, and this island, Hwahine, is somewhere in the middle
 between Tahiti, which is crowded and modern and everybody is busy, running somewhere,
 and another, well, it's not extreme, but it's also very different, the Toubouai from my previous videos,
 which had really few people, everybody knows each other, it's like one family, and no tourists,
 and it's sort of cut away from the main, from Tahiti and everything else, so it's quite different.
 When people were taking plane in Toubouai, it was a big event, I mean, the whole village
 came to say goodbye to some people who left, it is like those old days, when somebody went
 to another town, like on a train, everybody would be saying goodbye and crying, something
 like that. So that is Toubouai. But now I'm here in Hwahine, which is somewhere in the
 middle, it's much more peaceful, much more quiet, much less people, tourists here, compared
 to Tahiti, but still it's not that far, you just take a boat in 4 hours and you're here.
 So I decided to check it out and to talk to people here, to meet people, to tell them
 about the mission, and that's what I was doing yesterday all day, and I'll be doing it today,
 it's just morning, early morning now. So what are my impressions? My impression of the situation
 here is that people are more open and more willing to talk compared to Tahiti, they are
 not in the rush, every day here is about the same, and people have time, they value whoever
 they meet, for them it's important that they met someone today and talked to him or her,
 so they would give you the attention you need in order to do the mission, however of course
 it is also influenced much by the civilization in a bad way. So for example here I can see
 that people are very much interested in who I am, why I'm wearing this, what do I have
 to tell them, however the civilization is taking them on a car and they drive from one
 place to another, so they would be looking at me, who is this, what is he doing here,
 but they would be on a car going somewhere, rushing somewhere, so it's not like in the
 old days, the village and people are passing by, they just stop and talk to you, no here
 they are already on the car, going from point A to point B, this is modern world, so no
 matter how much they would want to talk to you, well of course some people who are really
 interested, they would stop and talk, but chances are that most people would not tell
 the driver, now stop and we change our plan and instead of going to the shopping center
 we will talk to this guy here. Now it's difficult, we can see how this modern world is limiting,
 it's separating people from one another. And another thing that I've talked with one person
 yesterday, she is a granddaughter of a queen of these islands, there is a royal family
 called Tamatua and these relatives of this family are everywhere, so most of the island
 of Tubuai is this Tamatua, and here there are a lot of these people from Tamatua family,
 and she is actually the granddaughter of a queen and she showed me the photo, but she
 is a very humble person, she says they are royalty, we are just simple people, I am just
 me and nothing else, and she is quite humble and she shared with me about how the life
 here changed over the last 30-50 years, and there are big changes, she said that when
 they were small they shared everything with their neighbors, with their friends, they
 would go fishing, have 10 fish and they would give it to 10 people, and other people would
 share bananas or something else, and they would live like one family, they would be
 open and friendly and support each other, but now it's so much different, 30-40 years
 have passed and the world has changed, people, it's all about money, people don't trust
 each other, avoid communicating with each other, it's business, we just talk business,
 people are much more materialistic and selfish, there is no trust, no cohesion, so this anti-Christian
 development is actually common to the whole world, it's not only here, maybe here it's
 much more evident, the change is big, it's not that gradual as say in Europe or somewhere
 in the big world, but here it's happening big time, and the thing is that she shared
 with me that who is responsible for this, in their eyes is the people from Europe, these
 white people who came, and most of them were also missionaries like me, they came here,
 they brought this new faith, they've converted everybody into some form of Christianity in
 a broad sense, and now the world has changed like this, so they are putting it all together,
 so now there is not too much trust and openness to some new missionaries that would come and
 bring something else like me, which is very sad, and which makes me feel that our mission
 should not be about persuading people that this is wrong and this is right, these dogmas
 are false and these dogmas are correct, it's not about that, the main point is not this,
 it is important that people can find a new source of true life for their soul in the
 Orthodox Church, that they can experience and they can receive the message from Christ,
 the love of Christ, so our goal is not just to convert, you have to become this, and now
 I go, my job is done and now I go, as missionaries we have to witness this love and we have to
 teach from our example, from our life, what this life in Christ, this new attitude towards
 people, that it's more than even this friendly society that they used to have here fifty
 years ago, that is giving them even more, in terms of their heart will become temple
 of the living God, their attitude to others will change, their life is going to change,
 their values, everything is going to change, this is reality, it's not some nice words
 and of course if we ask ourselves, do we ourselves, like priests and missionaries, do we live
 like this, do we, are we ourselves better than this kind people who used to share everything
 here with each other, as Christians we are supposed to be even more than this, more friendly,
 more open, less selfish, is this the case, and being honest I can tell you that most
 of us are not like this, so we have to begin from ourselves, if we want the mission to
 succeed, no matter it's here or anywhere, in your neighborhood, with your relatives,
 anywhere, if we want the mission to succeed we have to begin there, we have to begin with
 ourselves and only then when we can put on Christ, whoever is baptized in Christ has
 put on Christ, when we truly put on Christ and follow this narrow path of taking up our
 cross and following him, only then there is a chance that other people will be also willing
 to take up their cross and follow Christ, and that will be the true success of the mission
 and not to have many buildings, and Mormons have hundreds of buildings and tons of money,
 no it's not about this, it's about the true fire of the faith burning in the hearts
 of people, changing them from within, making them true temples of the living God, united
 in one body of Christ, the Holy Church, so these are my thoughts and I ask for your prayers
 for the mission here, I hope that every one of us can have these changes take place in
 our hearts and with the Lord's help we can do this, and also we need to understand that
 it's so different, it's so white people, they all come and bring something, but it's
 so much different, behind some there is Devil and Satan, this postmodernism and all kind
 of sects and all kinds of pseudo-culture, fake destructive culture that the big world
 is bringing here and the Church of Jesus Christ, the true Church, the body of Christ, the messenger
 of love and the true gates to salvation, this is so much different, let us be faithful to
 the Lord, let us be children of His kingdom and to share His kingdom, His message and
 His love with everyone around us, please pray for this mission, may God bless every one
