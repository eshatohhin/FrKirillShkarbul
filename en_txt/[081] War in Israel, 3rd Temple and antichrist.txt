 Dear brothers and sisters, in recent days, we hear about conflict that happened between
 Israel and sector Gaza, the bombings of Israel of many cities, and fights on Temple Mountain,
 and in many other cities in Israel between the Arabs and Jews, and the whole world is
 watching what's gonna happen. The things are getting better now, but still there are worries,
 and there are talks that maybe because of these fights, the two mosques which are on
 top of the Temple Mountain, they will be maybe demolished or something will happen, and then
 the third temple will be built in place of mosque of Al-Aqsa, there is also the dome
 of rock. Both of those mosques are very holy, very sacred for the Muslims, so those tensions,
 they have religious background, and even though Israel is a small country, it is very important
 country, and the town of Jerusalem is considered the center of the world, and we are involving,
 we are thinking about many countries, when this conflict happened, people are thinking
 about the United States, how it will react, how it will act, about the Arab world, Saudi
 Arabia and all those countries, Egypt, Iran, how Iran will react, how Russia will react,
 and all those, Turkey, Syria, all those things, so we see that Israel is really important
 in the world politics, and not only politics, it is also very important for spiritual reasons,
 because for a Christian the issue of the third temple has its relevance, we know that Antichrist
 will be crowned in the temple, and from the description of that temple, some interpreters
 they say that, we can see that it is neither the first temple nor the second temple, which
 was built after the Babylon exile and destroyed in the first century by Romans, but rather
 it is slightly different, and it has to be the third temple, and since the Antichrist
 hasn't come yet, we can say that, well, that is where he will be crowned at, so this is
 why for Christians, for most Christians, these issues are also troubling, because we are
 thinking about the end of the world, the times of Antichrist, we see the book of Revelation
 was written for us, so that we can know, we can be prepared for what's going to happen,
 and while thinking about these things, it is important to think deeper than just news,
 okay, what's going on, what are the political circumstances, agenda, why it's happening,
 there are different theories, why this happened this time, the political theory, the conspirological
 theory, there is another theory of great Israel that they are going to make, there are many
 different theories, but this is not what I want to talk about today, today I want to
 say about the issue of Antichrist, because for us it's important not when he will come,
 who exactly is going to be Antichrist, what he is going to do, for us the issue is what
 I can do today, now, as a Christian, okay, to spiritually be with Christ, and not to
 be deceived and be put into that Antichrist thing, the kingdom of Antichrist, the regime
 of Antichrist, and what can be done, in order for us to understand what can be done, we
 need to understand spiritually who is Antichrist, why is he mentioned, why is he relevant for
 us, to understand that we can begin from thinking about the plan of God, divine plan, and we
 also think about it, when we see how many children are dying in that war conflicts,
 in those conflicts, or from this coronavirus, we see how people who are innocent, they die,
 and we may think that where is God, God has disappeared, he doesn't care, he allows these
 bombs to happen, he allows the people to push the button that sends those bombs and allows
 those bombs to blow and kill those innocent children, and this doesn't make sense, okay,
 we say that, well, God cannot be like that, allow these things to happen, and when we
 think about it, we recall what Christ has said, when some people came and said the tower
 fell and killed 18 people, and he said, if you don't repent, all of you will die like
 that, so we can see that if people don't repent, their life is not of much value, God doesn't
 really care that much about their life, he does, but it's not that important that he
 makes that tower not to fall, say, or the bombs not to fall down, so we can see there
 is a direct relationship between the repentance and the price or the value of one's life in
 the eyes of the Lord, so we also recall that he said to his disciples, those who believe
 there will be signs accompanying them, for example, they will drink something poisonous
 and it will not harm them, they will take snakes, okay, poisonous snakes, and they won't
 harm them, so we also can see that there is this relationship between how someone is in
 the plan of God, and his life, whether it will be preserved or not, against the laws
 of nature, say, because to drink something poisonous, okay, we die, unless we are so
 much incorporated in the Lord's plan that he will override those laws and he will make
 us survive, so for example, if you are so much pleasing to God, if you are so much important
 to him, the bomb which is flying, okay, and is about to kill you, the Lord will send it
 somewhere else, because he says it's too early for you to go, I still need you, you are in
 my plan, so those things, I will make sure that they don't harm you, so this being included
 in God's plan has stages, okay, not every one of us, if we drink something poisonous
 will be okay, of course we don't do it on purpose, if somebody wants to kill us, gives
 us something like that, and this means that we are somewhat in God's plan, because we
 believe him, and we try to live with him, but we are still not that close to him, so
 that he will do miracles like that to preserve our life, so we need to be in stages, okay,
 our whole life is this progress towards God, to be closer to him.
 And there are three things that we can say makes someone unpleasing to God, or that makes
 someone fall out from the plan of God, I'm talking about this because the goal of the
 devil and antichrist is to make people fall out from this plan of God, okay, not to go
 from level one to level two, level three, but to go from level three to level two and eventually
 fall out, this is the goal of the satan and antichrist, so what makes someone be deprived
 of God's grace and blessing and union with him, okay, first of all, it's selfishness,
 living for yourself, for myself, okay, my future, my comfort, my tomorrow, my something,
 my family, my my my, okay, my property, okay, my plans, okay, and all of us are like this,
 and the Lord said, just let it go, leave, follow me, let these things go, okay, who
 will abandon his soul, he will find it, he will save it, so this is one thing, and this
 is what everybody is obsessed about, about his own life and goals and comfort and stuff,
 so this is the one thing that makes people fall out from the divine plan, another thing
 is being fixed on some sin, okay, not willing to let it go, to change, okay, living in sinful
 life and without repentance, okay, this is another thing, okay, we become more and more
 involved in that sin, okay, this is another thing that makes us deprived of God's grace
 and blessing and protection, and the third thing we can say is, is we call it delusion,
 when we live in some kind of, we are excited about something, we are possessed by something
 is driving us to do things, but this spirit is not coming from God, it's some kind of
 another motivation that drives us, motivates us, okay, it's not that we are calm and just
 very rational, no, we are willing to do many things, we are inspired, but this inspiration
 is not coming from God, it's a delusion, we are obsessed about something, and that's why
 we run in that direction, so these three things that makes people deprived of God's guidance
 and God being out, thrown out of his plan, and being away from him is also described
 by one word, can be described by one word, which is adultery, okay, or fornication, adultery,
 and adultery is not necessarily carnal adultery, okay, it's just one of types of adultery,
 another type, of course, there is spiritual adultery, when we embrace all kinds of religions,
 all kinds of astrology, we believe in yoga, we believe in Buddha, we believe in some other
 things in numbers, and other, many other things, okay, fortune, all of that is, and is represented
 by the ecumenism of our days, ecumenism is this adultery, okay, okay, adultery looks
 like love, it looks like we love somebody, when we go with adultery, but is it love,
 it's not, so that's why ecumenism also looks like love among different religions, but it's
 adultery, it's not love, even though it looks like love, it's not, okay, and another thing
 is intellectual adultery, when we embrace all kinds of different ways of thinking, ways
 of living, some philosophies, some people, like, like existential mindset, some other
 different, okay, Heidegger, or something else, intellectual, okay, adultery, and there is
 adultery of values, okay, when our values are not God, anything else, okay, property,
 material well-being, career, hobbies, travel, something else, well, it's too much of that,
 that's some kind of adultery in terms of values, those values, so adultery can be in your mind,
 it can be in your heart, it can be in your mouth, when people swear, that's adultery
 in their mouth, it can be on your body when you put these tattoos on your body, this is
 also some way of, okay, it's a natural thing, that we, it's not from God, it's adultery,
 it can be, okay, in the sexual adultery, it can be all kinds of adultery, the, the put,
 the avatar, that we put on our meeting, if, from this avatar, we can also judge, if it's
 adultery, if we have some kind of adultery in us, and all of us have some kind of adultery,
 so this is what keeps us away, okay, keeps us away from God, brings us somewhere else,
 so this is one word that can help us understand this phenomenon, which is in everything, okay,
 we can find it, okay, so we need to fight against this, and Antichrist and Devil, how
 Devil works, he understands your passions, in the same way, now we are analyzed by this
 artificial intelligence, by all those algorithms, what kind of searches do you do in Google,
 what you like, which pictures in Facebook you are looking longer than other pictures,
 okay, so it's analyzing, understanding your soul, okay, your corrupt, how, how, how corrupted
 you are, okay, what, so when there was a need to win some army, they sent prostitutes, pornography,
 some other things, okay, because they know, if, if the soldiers in that army will be involved,
 interested in these things, they will be much weaker, and we will overthrow this, okay,
 so adultery, all kinds of adultery, it's, it's like the, the weapon of the Devil in
 conquering people of Christ, and any people, okay, so this is how the kingdom of Antichrist
 will come into play, and be established, and now we can see that with this big data, that
 they analyze you, more and more you will be controlled, so it is through adultery, the
 power of Antichrist is extended towards every single person in this world, and now we are
 talking about not Devil who is spirit, but we are talking about people and the whole
 system which is in this world, which is incarnate, okay, it's not just spiritual, it's incarnate,
 there is infrastructure, and this is why Antichrist will be also incarnate, okay, this is why
 Devil needs this, okay, comrade, he needs this partner, okay, to work together, and
 this is why it's like, we, we can see this parallel, Christ, he became human, incarnation
 of Christ, God became man, so in the same way, Devil is seeking to get into this world,
 and to have his representative doing what he wants through media, not just through spiritual
 influencing people, but through infrastructure that can really control the whole world physically,
 not just spiritually, even physically, okay, who can distribute, decide whom to distribute
 goods, whom not to distribute goods, and things like this, and this is getting more
 and more possible, so this is what matters, that through sin, through all kinds of adultery,
 we surrender our freedom, we become, we lose our power as warriors of Christ, we become,
 and then we are conquered, okay, so this is what we are, what the world is heading to,
 okay, this is why there will be eventually this Antichrist coming and controlling almost
 all world population, so these are the things that we need to be aware of, we need to be
 on guard ourselves, and cutting these, okay, ways of controlling us, that come through
 the adultery that we have, all kinds of adultery, may the Lord help us, give us the heart of
 sacrificing ourselves, the heart of living for Christ, living for righteousness, making
 our hearts clean from all kinds of garbage and passions and darkness that there is, and
 trying to get into it, and then we will be strong and wise soldiers of Christ in his,
 incorporated into his plan, and our lives will have a high value for him, he will protect
 us, he will guide us through all these challenges and struggles, may the Lord help every one
 of us, give you his blessing, Christ is risen.
