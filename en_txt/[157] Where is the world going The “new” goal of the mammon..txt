 Dear brothers and sisters, today and next video I want to talk about what is going on
 in this world and where are we going.
 The overall understanding of the reality will help us avoid big mistakes and we can feel
 the spirit of Antichrist and guard ourselves against it so that we can be with Christ.
 Because the spirit of mammon is everywhere, and it got worse over the last 200 years.
 And it takes different shapes, and it's not that before this time there was no spirit
 of Antichrist.
 Of course it was around all the time.
 But now this mammon, this prince of this world, about which Christ talked a lot, gained much
 more influence on the people everywhere, in all countries across the world.
 It took it to the next stage.
 So, we as Christians, we want to be free of these things.
 We want to overthrow all the plans of the sudden.
 To overthrow, we need to know, we need to grasp this beast, this snake, and not let
 it get into our hearts and into this world, into the Church.
 Because it's getting everywhere, it's trying to sneak into every hole.
 So we can see from the last two centuries, it was the two centuries of capitalism.
 Before this, maybe, before the French Revolution, before the English Revolution, in the West
 it was in stages.
 We don't go deep into history, how this all developed gradually, but we can say that there
 was this very obvious transfer from the world where some ideals or some ideas were predominant
 drivers of human behavior, to the world where money and income became the predominant driver
 of human behavior.
 So this is why we, before this shift, we had many things.
 I'm not saying it's all right, it's all good.
 There were many things.
 There was a time of crusades, where people had some ideas and they went to find for that.
 There was a time of religious wars in Europe when people fought for what they believed
 is truth.
 There were times of romanticism, of knights, of honor, of dignity, of this monarchy and
 family-type relationship within a country, and many, many things.
 But all of that was gone, after the Industrial Revolution, all of those times were gone,
 and now the main motivation became income and focus on individual prosperity, well-being,
 and this influenced everything.
 If you want to know more about it, we can just read the Communist Manifesto, which describes
 all these changes that took place at that time.
 It's quite honest analysis of what has happened.
 For them, for the authors, it was good, because all of the development was good, because they
 themselves is what was stemming out from the capitalism, to create something new.
 Let us think deeper about this, okay, the transformation that happened, it was the victory
 of MAMO, we could say, because now it was directly grasping everybody and telling him,
 "Okay, now the most important thing is here on Earth and its production, money, benefit,
 and just go for it."
 And this created this great boost in production of many things, and in efficiency, and in
 science technology, and it was very practically oriented, we need to grow more stuff, we need
 to build more machines, we need to have better communication to deliver those goods.
 So this great boost, you can say it's good, or is there anything bad about it, well, from
 the motivation behind it, we can say that it was motivated by MAMO, first and foremost,
 and everything else helped contribute to this.
 Of course, this is also some kind of maturity of mankind, that we know better the laws of
 this world, and we understand the nature, so it's not all evil, we should not say in
 every science and development, okay, now these priests, they are those retrograds who only
 want Middle Ages and stuff like that.
 Well, yes and no, we just need to separate things.
 Now we're talking about overall social and value part of human being.
 So all these desires were awakened, now more entrepreneurship, you need to be more creative,
 you need to compete with each other, you need to work more, so longer hours, people were
 willing to work more to get more money, so it influenced everywhere, all levels of society.
 And of course this was joyful for MAMON, MAMON, this is great, I mean, MAMON wants people
 not to think about God, not to think about prayer, salvation, just think about the nice
 house and goods and convenience and stuff like that, so it was very helpful, very in
 line with what MAMON wants, so this is why all these children of MAMON, they are praising
 this thing, okay, however, this is, this appears to be only a stage for the MAMON to reach
 next goal, and the next goal is some kind of kingdom of MAMON, okay, and we call it
 Kingdom of Antichrist, so this kingdom is a fruit of this all-encompassing MAMONism,
 we don't call it the capitalism, let's call it MAMONism, so the fruit of this MAMONism
 has to be some kind of kingdom which will be different, it's not gonna be like those
 kingdoms before, but in some way it will be, but mainly it will be different, and so the
 rough idea about this kingdom was developed by those communists of the 19th century, Marx,
 Engels and others, socialists, so they had this vision, this idea, of what the future
 is gonna be like, and they were smart people, they were not stupid, so we should not think
 that, okay, no, it's all gone, now it's Marxism, it's dead, and it's all dead, well, you'll
 be surprised, it's coming back to life now, and in a new shape, in a new form, but this
 is what the inclusive capitalism is about, it's coming now as the new stage of capitalism,
 so we see that they have this vision, however, they encountered some problems, it was a clumsy
 model, it was not yet, they knew that something like that is gonna take place, but it was
 still clumsy, and they tried to sort of impose it right away, and they could not do that
 in the whole world, this degradation of the world goes not so fast, so stepping away from
 Christ and from some other ideals is not that fast, it doesn't happen overnight, so what
 they, okay, first of all, let's talk a little bit about the capitalism itself, it was all
 encompassing so that all countries of the world had to follow, okay, so the countries
 who did not catch up with the industrial revolution and all those values that were predominant,
 they were just destined to die out, we know that Mamom is basing himself, herself, I don't
 know what it was, okay, it's basing on this material world, it's trying to do things that
 cannot be shaken, so to say, it's well grounded, so it's not some abstract thing, so it's trying
 to depart from some real physical things, economics, politics, human values, and stuff
 like that, okay, so that's what the materialistic dialectics is about, or Spinoza ideas is all
 about, some people say those people are Spinozans, but it's another big story, what it's all
 about, so they are basing, they are well grounded in this industry, in this development
 of economic might that took place at that time, so everybody has to pull up, otherwise
 you'll be destroyed, okay, including China, Russia and the rest of the world, okay, if
 you're below, you'll be out, but one thing that happened, okay, is that countries like
 Russia, China was too far, but Russia posed a threat to that whole thing, Russia got mammonized,
 capitalized quite a lot, however not as much as was desired by the overall plan, so it
 was some kind of reactive force that was blocking the whole development of the world towards
 these ideas, so what they've done, they've decided, okay, now we need to just impose
 with force, we impose this next idea that we have of the world to come upon those countries
 that don't, we just do it, okay, with Russia, with China, with Eastern Europe, and with
 everybody who we can do it with, okay, so we'll play this prototype of this kingdom
 on those countries, and by doing this we will also socialize the capitalist countries, we
 make them more social, socialistic, okay, and it has many different shapes, all those
 things, it's not just as simple as that but I'm now talking about general things, so this
 is what they've done, okay, and that was very successful, okay, they succeeded, they implemented
 those things in these countries, and of course it was just a rough, clumsy model, so it could
 not live, and it was also not so well grounded on capitalism, okay, people were not as capitalized
 yet, so, but it destroyed all the culture, all the values, and everything in those countries,
 so after this path of socialism that happened in those countries, those societies, the people
 after the collapse of all these things, okay, even recently, 30 years ago, this big collapse
 of all those things, they became even more capitalistic in their mind than the western
 people, okay, so if you look now at these societies of post-Soviet Union, of China,
 they're much more crazy about money, even than the west, okay, selling themselves, okay,
 it's much more broken now, hacked, those societies are hacked by communism so that they can embrace
 this mammal even more, even more than anywhere else, okay, so now this paves the way for
 the successful construction of what was dreamed about by those guys, okay, by this coming
 to the next level, to the next world that they want, okay, and this next world, we need
 to see what it is, like in those days, in the 18th century, sorry, 19th century, when
 everything was in the west, was all capitalist, and the whole world was getting to become
 capitalist, these stamps, these things of communism and socialism were sprouting out
 everywhere, okay, and you had to notice, these guys are the guys of the future, these are
 even worse, okay, in terms of mammal than the regular capitalists that are just driven
 by income, by profit, okay, by mammal, this is something worse, okay, so now we also need
 to trace, okay, what are those things which are the forerunners of the future world, and
 there are many of them, okay, but this is something I want to talk about in the next
 video because I think it's too much for one video to talk about all these things, I want
 to ask every one of you to think about, first, think about this mammonism, okay, how this
 spirit of mammon, of capitalism, of profit, of benefit, penetrates you, penetrates your
 family, penetrates the organizations you're in, because everything changed with that,
 even church, okay, I mean, how it's run, especially the protestant churches and the Catholic,
 to some extent even the Orthodox, but not as much, okay, and other organizations, okay,
 so it became very much down to earth, very much what can be done in this world, okay,
 we do some projects, we help get rid of pollution, we help some poor countries, okay, but it
 became, it seems to be good, but it's all down to earth approach, and survival is based
 on how much money we have, okay, at the end of the day, so it became less idealistic,
 okay, less concentrated on the kingdom of heaven and its truth, on Jesus Christ and
 the holy life and sacraments, it became much more down to earth approach.
 And other things, okay, your country, your whatever social organization you're participating
 in, you can see these things, okay, we need to see first this first stage of mammon, mammon
 conquering this world, and then we'll, next time we'll talk about this second stage which
 is coming, second big stage, okay, of course there were many different sub-stages, and
 also we go back, we go back and to see that this happened many times in history already,
 but to a lesser extent, much lesser extent, we can see this in the history of Byzantine
 when the society declared itself Christian, but lived according to mammon, and then the
 punishment came, then similar things happened with Russia, which also declared that we're
 all Christians, we're all Orthodox, but lives more and more according to the mammon, and
 then the Russian revolution came, okay, and maybe there are numerous examples how the
 Lord is punishing those who, and even in Old Testament for that matter, you can go back
 and see how the Israel, instead of worshipping God, worshipped Baal, worshipped the fake
 idols of prosperity, and which brought, they thought they bring prosperity and well-being
 and stuff like that, instead of worshipping the true God, so all these things they happened
 never, this spirit of Antichrist was always with us, with humanity, but now it's gaining,
 it's coming to the next level, okay, so let us think about this, let us not become slaves
 of this spirit of mammon, and help also those around us to overcome, to get rid of this
 mindset, of this some deep drive that drives you, okay, I want more, more, more, and we
 need to get rid of it.
 May the Lord help us, keep us away from any deceit, from any passion, and help us stay
 firm on the path to salvation, by the grace of his Holy Spirit, Amen, God bless.
