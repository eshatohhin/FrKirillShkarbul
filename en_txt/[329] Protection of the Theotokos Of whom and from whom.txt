Dear brothers and sisters, on October the 14th the Holy Church is celebrating the Feast of the Protection of the Holy Theotokos. It's also called the Veal of Theotokos, or Pokrov. This feast is the time when we celebrate an event which happened a long time ago. 

It happened in Constantinople, when most of the people were Christians, and all of a sudden they were invaded, they were being attacked by barbarians, and there was no hope. And when they gathered in the church and prayed earnestly and repented of all the sins, saints saw in the heavens the Mother of God who took her veil. This veil is a homophorion, it's a part of a cloth, it's not just a kerchief, it's part of cloth, and she put it upon these people who were praying. 

And at this time the barbarians, they were afraid of something mysterious, and they just ran away in panic, and many of their ships were sank. And there was an understanding, there was understanding that this miracle happened because of the repentance of the people. And while they all considered themselves Christians, they lived a life which was worldly, which was serving mammon, and that is why there was this chastisement, or this tribulation, this pestilence, which came because there was still a hope that they will repent, and they did. 

Today I want to say about a very basic problem that we have that misunderstands this feast and makes it a pagan feast. We need to see this attempt of the devil to substitute something misleading, something earthly, something deceitful, instead of holy. This is how he substituted this idea of worldly king that the Jews were expecting as their Messiah, and for which reason they've crucified Christ. 

Okay, and we see this all the time, that the devil is giving some surrogate which seems to be logical, and understandable, and desirable, and however it is bringing misery, apostasy, and destruction. Okay, and what I'm going to tell you today pertains not only to Orthodox Christians, but to the whole humanity which is ultimately going to choose Antichrist as their ruler, and why will that happen? Because all people from their childhood, they like comfort, they like guarantees, they like someone else to take responsibility, and to provide security for them. This is why all those systems succeeded. 

It's both the socialism, which has some government which is deciding everything on your behalf, and is giving you everything that is needed, like basic needs, shelter, security, education, etc. Work, stable. On the other hand, we have this so-called democracy which is also another word for socialism, but in a different shape, which gives you some fake protection in the form of constitution, or laws, or private property rights. 

And people, they worship this as their God, because they don't want to face any risks, any serious responsibility for what they do. So, be it so-called liberal, democratic, quote-unquote society, be it totalitarian society, it is all based on that need that people want to have, to have their problems solved. Okay, it's just a different form. 

For example, in a socialist government, it would be a government which gives you pensions, that tells you that you don't need to worry when you get old, that you will die of hunger, we will provide that. And in the capitalist places, it will be some pension plans, some RRSP, savings, and the law will guarantee that it won't be seized or taken away from you, and people are ready to die for that. And in the past, it was a bit different, it was, they would depend on the children, that's why people were giving birth to many children, not because they loved children, well, of course, people cared more in those days about the commandment of God to live for others, but generally it was also motivated big time by the insecurity and hope that the children will take care of them when they get old, because there was no one else who would be taking care of them at that time. 

Okay, and in most places, we will find that there is this deep need for someone else to take care of your basic needs, and also there is this great demand for information, somebody else to tell you what to think about things, okay, who is right, who is wrong, what is going on in the world, and not many people really do bother to do research and to go and search and verify all the information that they're getting, so they're being brainwashed from different sites, okay, it could have different shapes and forms, but it all boils down to that, okay, this is all need for protection. In those ancient times, pagan societies, pagan cultures, they had this need for some fetish, for some things to carry which would give them some protection against spells, against powers of nature, against enemies, death, etc. Until now, people think that that is what is going to protect them, and some people even go baptized so that they would receive some guardian angel and have protection of their health, their work, their family, their business, but this is not what Christ has brought, this is not what the Christianity is all about, so today when we celebrate, well, not today, a few days ago, when we celebrate the protection of the mother of God, we should not think of it as just some extra security, extra guarantee that nothing is going to go off, because many people, even in the church, they think that they need to do ABC and they will receive this protection from the mother of God, from the saints, from Christ, and they will be fine in this world, and this is what they care about, and we receive this paganization of faith, and I saw quite many people who left the church when something bad happened in their life, because they said, for many years we attended this service, we've done this, we've kept the fasts, we've done the prayers, we've done everything, and why all of a sudden I have this problem? I have, I don't know, divorce, I'm fired, I have a child who died or something else, some big impact, okay, some tragedy happening in my family, in my personal life, I went bankrupt or something else, why God did not protect me? Well, because he is not here for that, he came here not to give you a happy comfortable life in this world and make you just one of those pagans who have, I don't know, Mercedes and, I don't know what else, AI refrigerator which orders food for them, you have thousands of people like that, I don't know where, in Beverly Hills or somewhere else, but God did not come to this world to make you one of them, that's not what he came for, because for many people their Christianity is just some addition, just some extra bonus, okay, extra protection, but this is not what Christianity is all about, Christianity is about rejecting this world, repenting and putting all your effort and all your aims in the kingdom of God, why a few years ago everybody complied with this craziness when you had to put stuff on your mouth and when there was nobody getting sick already and had all these measures and had to close the churches, okay, and you couldn't come out of your house etc and all that craze that went and so many suicides and people went crazy, went nuts because of those, that craze, all this hysteria which was poured through the media and didn't see that it was about manipulation, about control, because people opted out for safety, they thought that government is going to provide them safety and they will do anything and if you need to get a QR code and you need to get the vaccine or something else, anything, ready for anything, because people are not used to questioning authority, you question authority, sorry, maybe I don't need to communicate with you, because you question authority, what is this? We obey to everything, I don't call for revolution or, I don't know, riots or something like that, but we are given our own brain to do research, to understand, to make decisions for us, for our children and not to just blindly obey to something because it guarantees something, so it's using two main tools, the fridge, that we are afraid that it will be empty if we don't comply, we lose a job or we, I don't know, taxed or something else and the information which comes either through TV or YouTube or anything else, you know, media, telegram and people are brainwashed by that, so these are the tools, this is where people find their safety, find their refuge, okay, find their protection, be it physical, economical, psychological, people run into all kinds of activities thinking that that will give them some kind of relief and protection and brothers and sisters, many people think that the protection of the Holy Theotokos, this is it, it gives you some spiritual protection as long as you are there, as long as you participate in some processions, okay, in some rituals, you will get that protection, it's not about that, it's all about repentance, if we're not repenting, okay, we're not going to enter the kingdom of God, okay, and for us the protection of the Holy Theotokos is the protection of what? It's the protection of our union with Christ, it's not about protection of this earthly stuff that we have, this situation, health and prosperity, etc., peace, it's not about this, brothers and sisters, as long as we are with Christ, as long as we stand in repentance, in following Christ, carrying our crosses, that will mean that anything else can be faced, we can go through any challenges, any sorrows, any tribulations that we might have to go through and we don't need a special protection against that, okay, we trust the Lord that He will not give us something we cannot bear, we cannot overcome and we don't put this as a great concern or priority, He said seek first and foremost the kingdom of God and its truth and its justice and its righteousness and everything else will be given to you, not that He will give to us prosperity, etc., anything He deems necessary for us He will give, maybe it will be poverty, but it's okay, it's not a tragedy, okay, it's something He finds appropriate for your salvation, if it be poverty, not because of your laziness, but because of, say, evil, tribulation or something else and we know that in the time of Antichrist that is what's going to happen, okay, and brothers and sisters, so I can tell you that this social need, individual and social need for this someone taking care, okay, someone taking responsibility, it's coming from childhood, okay, when children are used to have parents take care of all their needs, etc., to clean up for them, to provide them food, okay, shelter, etc., okay, and this will be the factor, the main factor by which Antichrist is going to come to power, brothers and sisters, this is the main thing which he is studying diligently and which he will utilize to gain his power and his forerunners are already in power, okay, through these things, this is why sociology and all these social sciences of manipulation and subduing people, behaviorism, etc., they are so prominent, okay, and this is why it's all about this power and deceit on the public scale is what they are so much concerned about, creating all these golems and all these illusionary narratives and creating clashing people with each other through wars and creating slavery through legalization of drugs, etc., all these things, they all come together, brothers and sisters, they are all tools of the Antichrist to subdue people, to make them love their slavery, to make him crave for this new world order which will be this technocratic dystopia, okay, which may be much worse than we can even imagine, okay, but most people will embrace it with joy and be sure that there will be no place for true Christianity, for true repentance in that world because it will be replaced by this kosher and fake, perverted, inverted Christianity that will appeal to people's desires and arrogance, okay, and their worship of their own fallen self, their intellect.

So, brothers and sisters, today's, not today's, but the feast that we're still celebrating, the feast of protection of the Mother of God, it's a feast of repentance, it's a feast of reconciliation with the Lord, okay, that we find peace in union with Him, in relying, supporting, finding support in Him, because for Him this is also what is, what does matter, so He says all those burdened and toiled people, miserable, come to me and you will find consolation, you will find refuge in me, He is the consolation, He is the refuge, may we always turn our hearts to Him, may we not seek this world's stuff, may we not be afraid, may we not subdue to its logic, okay, this logic of submissiveness to everything and believe in all that fake narratives so that we can feel that we're part of something, that there are so many people who think in the same way, okay, and all this logic that, okay, we just need some kind of authority, is this, is this source coming from some scientifically proven, I don't know, magazine or something? If it is, oh, this, then it's shining that it's true, okay, or it's some news platform that we believe, I don't know, BBC, CNN or something else, if it's coming from there, oh, we receive it, we trust it, let us not be like those, like those manipulated people who think that they're free, who are speaking so much about democracy, but who are completely brainwashed and subdued through this inherent need for security, stability, groundedness, guarantees in this world. The Lord didn't tell the apostles, I'll give you some guarantees in this world, but now people always talk about guarantees, you want to go to mission, what are the guarantees? Do I have stable income, shelter, etc.? If not, I will go to some sect, which will give me that. Let us be not slaves of mammon, neither in the way we live, nor in our mind, brain, heart. 

I hope you can see what I'm talking about, both in yourselves and in people around you. If you don't see, if you think that I'm talking about something else, someone else, then probably you're not getting it. May the Lord give us vigilance, give us spiritual freedom, and truly protect us in this path of holiness, I mean, merry protection of the Holy Theotokos, brothers and sisters.
