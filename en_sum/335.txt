In today's message, I want to focus on identifying the spirit of Mammon and the spirit of this world in our daily lives. We are called to be vigilant against spiritual threats that can lead us away from Christ, just as the Pharisees and Sadducees were warned. Many fall into the trap of worldly logic—prioritizing stability, happiness, and self-satisfaction—without realizing these are forms of modern idolatry. If our faith is merely an addition to our busy lives, we risk being pagans in disguise.

We must seek a balance: neither becoming like radical sects that see evil everywhere nor embracing ecumenism that blurs the lines between Christianity and other beliefs. Instead, we are to recognize Christ’s presence everywhere—in nature, history, and people—while discerning what opposes Him. True faith means making Christ our sole priority, guided by His wisdom above all else.

As we enter the Nativity Fast, let us intensify our spiritual lives through prayer, scripture, and self-sacrifice. Only by living in Christ can we avoid delusion and become bearers of His light to a world in darkness. May His grace and love work through us always. Amen.
