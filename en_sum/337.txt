In response to questions about why Orthodox Christians cannot unite with Catholics, I explain that Roman Catholicism is not a true church due to three fundamental heresies. First, the Papacy wrongly places the Pope as the infallible head of the church, usurping God’s role and creating a Judaizing heresy where unity and truth are tied to a human institution rather than Christ. Second, Catholic theology blasphemes God by portraying Him as an angry judge demanding compensation for sins, distorting His loving nature and the meaning of Christ’s redemption. Third, the addition of the *filioque* to the Creed misrepresents the Holy Spirit, leading to a loss of true grace and opening the door to false spirituality. These errors mean that, unlike the Orthodox Church—which, despite imperfections, remains the salvific ship guided by the Holy Spirit—Catholicism is a sinking ship that cannot lead to salvation. Protestantism, arising from these errors, has produced even worse heresies. True love requires honesty about these differences, not the false unity of ecumenism that betrays the faith.
