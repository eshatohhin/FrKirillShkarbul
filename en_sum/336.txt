The Feast of the Entrance of the Theotokos into the Temple prepares us for Christmas, reminding us that we are each called to become a living temple for God, not in stone, but in our hearts. This path requires a daily choice: to follow Christ on the narrow way or to be enslaved by the spirit of this world—the spirit of selfishness, deceit, and mammon. The real spiritual battle is not against external forces or institutions, but within ourselves. We must awaken, repent, and live entirely for Christ, resisting deception and apostasy. Our focus during this season must be on preparing our hearts for His coming, taking up our cross, and following Him with love and vigilance.
