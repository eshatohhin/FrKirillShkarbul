I warn that the religion of Babylon—the synagogue of Satan—is infiltrating the Church, often successfully. I observe how New Age and Eastern spiritualities like Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism are embraced, even by some who claim to oppose consumerism, while rejecting Christ and His Church. They promote values like tolerance, diversity, and democracy, while labeling Christians as totalitarian or hateful.

I highlight how ecumenism and liberal theology, seen in movements like the Second Vatican Council, undermine true faith by merging Christianity with other religions. Within Orthodoxy, compromises like calendar changes and ecumenist agreements betray unity and tradition. I caution against modern distortions, such as obsession with energies, miracles, or psychology, which replace genuine spirituality.

To guard against this, I urge steadfast faith through prayer, repentance, theological education, and daily Gospel reading. Only asceticism, active ministry, and loyalty to Christ can preserve us from this deception. May God grant us strength to remain on the path of truth and salvation. Amen.
