As we approach Christmas, I reflect on what it truly means to be a Christian. The Apostle Paul says we have nothing, yet possess everything. This highlights the tension between the spiritual and material worlds—a core truth of the Gospel. Without grasping this, we misunderstand our faith entirely.

Being "poor yet making many rich" and "having nothing yet possessing everything" means that through union with God, we view the world through His eyes. Everything belongs to Him; material possessions are secondary to spiritual realities. When we draw closer to God through prayer, asceticism, and following His commandments, worldly attachments lose their grip. We are called to reject selfishness, greed, and materialism—the very things that divide us.

Yet, a dangerous deception is at work: the promise of a world where you "have nothing and be happy." Systems like socialism, capitalism, or the "New World Order" may offer material security but replace God with false idols—technology, ideology, or even the Antichrist. They strip away responsibility and promise peace without Christ. True Christians, however, belong to the spiritual realm. We find joy not in possessions but in Christ, even amid persecution.

This spiritual conflict manifests even within the Church, such as in the division over celebrating Christmas. Some align with secular or heterodox dates, prioritizing worldly unity over Orthodox unity. This undermines our witness and paves the way for a one-world religion that abandons truth.

Neither capitalism nor communism will save us—only Christ can. By living in Him, we become immune to worldly delusions and live as genuine Christians: free, joyful, and truly rich in what matters eternally. Let us remain faithful, detesting heresy and worldly compromise, and pray for unity in truth. May God bless our fasting and prepare our hearts for His Nativity.
