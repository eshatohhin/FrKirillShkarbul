The Gospel reveals that the Lord was only surprised by two things: human unbelief and genuine faith, like that of the centurion. True faith, as defined in Hebrews 11:1, is the substance of things hoped for and the assurance of things not seen. It makes the hope of God’s kingdom real in our lives, empowering us to live for Christ and even face martyrdom.

Today, many lack this faith, replacing the kingdom of God with earthly substitutes—whether political power, nationalism, economic stability, or false utopias. This mirrors the deception before Christ’s first coming, when people sought earthly kingdoms instead of God’s reign. Now, similar illusions—from nationalism to technocratic dreams—pave the way for the Antichrist, who will offer false miracles and security to those without faith.

In the Church, we also struggle with unbelief, such as reducing faith to mere statements (as in some Protestant teachings) or clinging to earthly symbols like holy lands or miracles. True faith is a living trust in Christ that transforms our entire life, enabling us to carry our cross daily. Without it, we become vulnerable to deception.

As faith weakens globally, the rise of Antichrist becomes imminent, not merely due to technology, but because people choose the world over Christ. Let us strengthen our faith, relying solely on Christ’s promise of peace and salvation, so we may remain steadfast in truth until the end.
