In today's world filled with wars, economic crises, and uncertainty, many Christians struggle to understand God's purpose. The ultimate goal behind these trials isn't merely suffering or destruction—it's Satan's attempt to turn humanity against God. Through hardship, the devil seeks to make us forget God, blame Him, and ultimately become His enemies.

True Christianity calls us to a radical response: instead of fear or complaint, we're to rejoice in suffering, love our oppressors, and remain thankful even when deprived. This mindset—modeled by Christ and taught by Apostle Paul—protects us from Satan's plan to create a world of God-haters. By embracing this perspective, we prepare our hearts for Christ's return and resist the spirit of Antichrist already at work in our divided world.
