In my previous message, I warned about the dangers of paganism infiltrating the Church. Today, I want to highlight how the spirit of this world, through its social aspects, also threatens to corrupt the Church. This spirit manifests in two opposing poles: one is traditionalist, authoritarian, and hierarchical—symbolized by the "beast" in Revelation—representing control and limited freedom. The other is liberal, anarchic, and individualistic—symbolized by the "harlot of Babylon"—where everyone becomes their own authority, leading to chaos and division.

Both extremes seek to penetrate and distort the Church. On one side, some cling to rigid, caste-like systems, reminiscent of historical hierarchies, where clergy are elevated as a privileged class. On the other, others embrace excessive freedom, rejecting tradition and hierarchy altogether, as seen in liberal movements. Neither path leads to true salvation.

True Christianity, as taught by Christ, calls for humility, service, and obedience rooted in love—not in power, status, or individualism. The Church is a kingdom guided by grace, not worldly structures. We must avoid the traps of both traditionalism and modernism, focusing instead on the Gospel’s wisdom to navigate these temptations. Let us pray for the Church, strive for personal holiness, and bear witness to Christ without judgment or division.
