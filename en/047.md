# Covid temptation for the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, there are still issues in the church and, indeed, in the whole world regarding the coronavirus problem. The issue is that many people claim there is no pandemic, that churches should not be closed, and that church authorities lack faith because they implement measures that sometimes seem like blasphemy or sacrilege. During communion, there are procedures that some feel undermine their belief in God. If you fear the virus so much that it seems almighty, then you are not acknowledging that God the Creator is almighty. 

This has led to many quarrels and accusations that church leaders are either too undemocratic or have sold themselves to the government. There is turmoil within the church because people, driven by their passions, believe they are right, and conflicts arise. I have already recorded some videos on this topic in the past, but since the situation has not settled, I believe further clarification is needed. This also prompts us to reflect more deeply on our faith and our relationship with God. This is what I want to share today.

The core problem is rooted in faith. What is faith? Is it merely belonging to a religious organization, formally accepting all the dogmas and rules, and doing whatever the organization—be it a church or another group—tells you to do? If you believe everything correctly and do everything you are supposed to do, are you fine? This is one attitude toward religion and faith, but it is a false attitude. What matters to Christ is your heart. What matters is whether you trust Him daily and follow Him by striving to keep His commandments as much as possible. His kingdom should be a true reality for you. You should seek this kingdom and testify to its truth, feeling it either in your heart or close to it.

The Lord said, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself." Who lives like that now? He also said, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." Yet, we fear everything except God. God is good, so why fear Him? Instead, we fear not having enough money, facing legal issues, problems with our children, loneliness, or anything else. We fear the coronavirus. We fear everything. But we still belong to a church, whether Orthodox or not. However, this is not as important to Christ Himself.

With this in mind, we can say that when we have mature faith and are not afraid, we will not fear the coronavirus. We can believe that nothing will happen to us in church because we pray to God. Christ said, "Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." It is as straightforward as that. Trust that what you ask for will happen, and you will receive it. Who has such faith now? If we do have such faith, we can pray and go about our lives without fear. Christ even said that if you have faith, you could drink poison and it would not harm you. But He also said, "Do not put the Lord your God to the test." We do not do such things on purpose, but most of us do not have that level of faith. When we drink something harmful, we die because we do not truly trust Him.

So there are things we find in the Gospel and the Bible. We see that the Lord comes to the Jewish people, who all believe in God. They have 100% faith, affirm that God exists, attend the synagogue, and know the Bible very well. Yet, He says to them, "You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?" This could also be said about modern-day Christians, including Orthodox believers. At the same time, we read in the Epistle of Saint Apostle Paul that we are "a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession." We are told that we are taken into the Lord’s bosom, chosen by Him, and that we are saints, holy in His eyes. 

So how do we reconcile these two things? On one hand, we are sinners, lacking faith, betraying Christ, and worse than garbage—because garbage does not sin. Yet, on the other hand, we hear these words of holiness and divine calling. The key lies in repentance. When we repent, we draw close to God, and in His eyes, we become holy. If we can understand how these two truths coexist—that we are both sinners and saints through repentance—we can begin to solve the problem of faith regarding the coronavirus measures in the churches.

Now, we see that church authorities are in a very difficult position. On one hand, they must testify to faith, proclaiming that God will save and protect His faithful, that He will not allow harm to come to those who trust in Him. They must affirm that this is true and real. On the other hand, they must recognize that people are different. Not everyone who comes to church has mature faith—sometimes even the authorities themselves lack it. This places them in a challenging situation: they must testify to faith while also complying with measures that, on the surface, may appear as though they do not believe in God’s power to save and protect. 

In essence, they must balance the spiritual testimony of faith with the practical responsibility to care for the diverse needs and vulnerabilities of their flock. This tension reflects the broader struggle of living out faith in a complex and fallen world, where trust in God must coexist with wisdom and care for others.

So they are squeezed between these two realities, and it takes great wisdom and faith to navigate this dilemma. What we need is more education for the people, so they understand that the church authorities are not betraying Christ, especially regarding practices like using a spoon dipped in vinegar or alcohol during communion. Some people see this as sacrilege or blasphemy, accusing the church of not believing in God, of "sanitizing Christ," and betraying their faith. They claim this cannot be Christianity if such measures are taken. 

We need to explain to people that similar practices have been implemented during past pandemics, and there is no betrayal of Christ or sacrilege involved. It is not that we believe the body of Christ carries the virus, but rather that surfaces, like spoons, might. Even if we believe these measures are unnecessary, complying with government regulations is not inherently wrong. We can still testify to our faith in other ways—through ministry, loving our neighbors, and mission work. These actions demonstrate our faith in Christ far more effectively than accusing others of betrayal or serving the anti-Christ. Such accusations are misguided.

At the same time, church authorities must recognize that there are limits. For example, I believe closing churches is a mistake. Implementing strict measures is acceptable, but completely shutting churches and barring people from entering crosses a line. This reflects a lack of faith. Throughout 2,000 years of history, the church has faced plagues, pandemics, and far worse diseases than the coronavirus, yet churches were never closed. This is a mistake, and we must call it what it is: a lack of faith, understanding, and love.

When faced with evil or difficult situations, there are three ways to respond. The first is to retaliate aggressively—someone hits you, and you hit back. The second is to run away, betraying your principles out of cowardice. The third way, which Christ demonstrated, is to stand firm, endure the blows, and witness to your faith in God and love for your neighbor. Christ taught us to turn the other cheek when struck. We must follow this example. When we can comply with measures without betraying Christ, we do so. But when compliance means betraying Christ, we must refuse. 

Faith is essential, and everyone, including church authorities, can make mistakes. Let us strive to be true Christians, not merely in form or by following rules, but in the strength of our faith and love for Christ and our neighbors. Without these, no external rules or measures will suffice. Let us reflect on this, grow in wisdom, and nurture the power of faith within us, with God’s help. May God bless each of you and me.
