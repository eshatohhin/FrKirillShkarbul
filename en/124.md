# Power of Blessing - how to “Plant” the Kingdom of God

Dear brothers and sisters, the new year is approaching, and we will be wishing each other many blessings, asking the Lord to bless the coming year. But what does it mean to bless, and how can we bless God? He can bless us, and we can bless Him. 

In the seminary, we had a discussion about what happens when a priest blesses someone. Is it merely a form of greeting, like saying "hello," or is there a deeper, mystical power behind it? This might seem like a simple question, but we know there is a special power involved, even if some people don’t believe it. 

But what is this power, and how is it that not only priests but also laypeople—anyone—can bless? We bless food, we bless our children, and we perform various other blessings. How is this possible? And why is Christ called the "Blessed One"? Scripture says, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord," and "Blessed is the kingdom of David that is coming." 

Moreover, in Matthew 5:44, the Lord tells us, "I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you or treat you badly." So, we are called to bless those who hate us or curse us. But what does it mean to bless them? Is it simply saying, "Oh, blessed are you"? Are these just words, or is there more to it?

To understand this better and to appreciate what we are doing when we wish someone well—whether it’s wishing them success in university, a Merry Christmas, or anything else—we need to explore what it means theologically. What truly happens when we express such wishes? When we grasp the depth of this act, we will think more carefully about what we say and wish for others, and we will find great joy in doing so.

Blessings can also be expressed through thanking God. The Eucharist, the divine liturgy, is the ultimate blessing—God blessing us by giving us Himself, and we, in turn, uniting with Him in this sacred act. 

The Greek word *eulogeo* provides insight into this concept. *Eulogeo* means "to speak well" or "to say good things." In worship, through our praises, blessings, and exaltations, we are speaking well of God, expressing our gratitude and reverence toward Him. In response, He blesses us, approving us and bestowing His joy, power, light, and life upon us.

In our daily lives, we often find ourselves unhappy with people, the weather, or various circumstances. This unhappiness stems from a lack of thankfulness toward God. A heart that is truly thankful to God is exemplified in the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. Lazarus, covered in sores and suffering greatly, is called *Elazar* in Hebrew, which means "God has helped." This seems paradoxical—how has God helped him in his misery? Yet, the name itself points to a deeper truth about God’s presence and care, even in suffering.

When we bless others or thank God, we are acknowledging His goodness and inviting His grace into our lives and the lives of others. Let us strive to cultivate thankful hearts, recognizing that every blessing we give or receive is a reflection of God’s love and power at work in us.

But let us consider the rich man in contrast. He celebrates every day, yet he feels no need to thank God or pray. Lazarus, on the other hand, as his name *Elazar* ("God has helped") suggests, has a heart that is thankful to God, even in the midst of his suffering. Despite his pain and misery, Lazarus endures with gratitude, trusting in God’s help. When he dies, the angels immediately carry him to the bosom of Abraham. His soul, shaped by thankfulness and patience, serves as a model for us. No matter how difficult our circumstances, we are called to be thankful to God, trusting that He is helping us through our trials. This attitude of continuous thankfulness and blessing is the essence of spiritual health and union with God.

This spiritual health is gained through the interchange of blessings with God. Only through this union can we be saved and remain with Him. As I explained earlier, the divine liturgy is the ultimate expression of this union, where we receive God’s blessings and, in turn, bless Him. 

In Hebrew, the word for blessing is *bracha*. When we say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord" (*Baruch haba b’shem Adonai*), we are acknowledging God’s power and goodness. The basic meaning of *bracha* is to bestow power, success, prosperity, or fertility, or to declare that someone already possesses these gifts. When we bless God, we acknowledge that He is the source of all good things—power, success, prosperity, and every blessing. 

However, there is a deeper meaning to *bracha*, one that is tied to the idea of abundance and connection. To bless is like planting someone into the kingdom of heaven, allowing them to draw life and sustenance from it. It is akin to grafting a branch onto a tree, as the Apostle Paul describes in Romans 11:17-24. We are like branches taken from a wild tree and grafted onto a cultivated one, receiving life and nourishment from the new source. Blessing, then, is about establishing a connection, a window through which we are tied to the kingdom of heaven. 

When we pray, "Your kingdom come, Your will be done," we are asking for God’s kingdom to be planted in us, in our families, and in the world. This connection to the kingdom of heaven brings eternal life, salvation, and freedom. 

In Hebrew, when we say, "God blesses you," it is not merely a wish or a polite expression. It is a declaration that carries power. Because we are created in God’s image, we participate in His work of blessing. When we say, "God bless you," it is not just words; it is an act of transferring and sharing God’s power with others. This blessing grounds them in the kingdom of heaven and connects them to the source of all blessings—God Himself. 

Thus, blessing is not just about expressing good wishes; it is about participating in God’s work of grace, bringing His life and power into the lives of others. It is a profound act of faith and love, rooted in our union with God and our desire to see His kingdom come.

But the question arises: Is everyone’s blessing the same? If I am far from God—and indeed, we all are to some extent—how can I effectively bless others? When we sin, we turn away from God, and in doing so, we distance ourselves even further. If we reject Him, how can we help unite someone else with Him? If we ourselves are facing away from God, not craving or desiring to be with Him, how can we genuinely wish for someone else to be united with Him? It becomes impossible. 

When we are in sin, when our hearts are filled with pride, attachment to this fallen world, or other forms of spiritual "garbage," our blessings lack power. Even if we speak the words, they may not carry the transformative grace they are meant to. Therefore, it is crucial for us to draw closer and closer to God, to cultivate a deep craving for His blessing within ourselves. Only then can we share this blessing effectively with others, including our enemies and those with whom we have strained relationships. 

By doing so, we become more like God in our hearts, minds, and attitudes. This alignment with God’s will allows our blessings to truly influence others and spread throughout the world. Just as vaccines are designed to spread immunity against disease, we are called to spread the gospel, offering the world immunity against evil. We want as many people as possible to be close to God and blessed by Him. This is our mission, especially as we approach the New Year. 

Let us wish for the New Year to bring us closer to God, to help us carry His blessing, and to share it with others. Without this connection to God, life will be exceedingly difficult. So, let us wish each other every kind of blessing. Personally, I want to express—and I am not merely saying this—that the Lord blesses everyone. May He grant you great joy in the upcoming year, success in every good deed, and fulfillment of every good intention in your heart. May your hearts be filled with light, your families united, and everyone in your household strengthened and blessed. 

May the Lord grant you wisdom, guidance, and a stronger faith. May your commitment and love for Him grow deeper. May this New Year bring light, success, and spiritual growth to your hearts and lives, drawing you closer to Him. May you enjoy the fruits of faith, the joy of His sonship, and His divine mercy—unobstructed, unaltered, and free from error, selfishness, mistakes, and destruction. 

May the Lord protect you from all evil in this world, chase it away, and crush the enemy under your feet. Amen. God bless.
