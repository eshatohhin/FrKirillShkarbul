# Why there are 12 Apostles Meaning of the number “12”.

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are going to talk about the 12 called disciples of Christ.  
Why 12? What is the meaning of the number 12? We know that in the Old Testament, there were 12 tribes of Israel, and each tribe descended from a patriarch. There were 12 patriarchs—the 12 sons of Jacob, or Israel—and these 12 tribes inherited the Promised Land. Each tribe gained a portion of this land and settled there. However, the tribe of Levi did not inherit land; they became priests. They did not have property, and every other tribe had to support them. Thus, Levi became the tribe of priests. So, the number 12 signified the fullness of the people of God.  

However, during Old Testament times, many tribes were lost or mixed with other peoples. We remember the Assyrian invasion of the northern kingdom of Israel, where 10 tribes lived, and later the Babylonian invasion of the southern kingdom of Judah, which consisted of two tribes: mainly Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests, the Levites, descendants of Levi. By the time of Christ’s coming, only two and a half tribes or branches remained: Benjamin, Judah, and part of Levi. The other nine and a half tribes were lost and mixed with other nations. Even when people knew they were Jews by descent, they often did not know their specific tribe. To this day, this issue persists, and there are various theories about it. Some say four tribes are known, others say five, but in any case, most of those tribes were mixed and lost.  

There was a promise that the Savior would come to the people of Israel and restore these tribes. He would restore the people of Israel and bring them salvation. However, the way He fulfilled this was not through the physical restoration of the tribes but by establishing a new Israel—the Church, which became the new people of God. As the heads or patriarchs of this new people of God, Christ appointed the 12 apostles. From these 12 apostles, the faith was spread to all humanity. We have the apostolic faith and the apostolic Church, which traces its origins to the apostles. The fullness of faith was entrusted by Christ to the apostles, and they delivered it to us intact. This is the primary meaning of the number 12 in relation to the apostles.  

In the Gospels, Christ says that He will give these 12 apostles 12 thrones in the heavenly Jerusalem to judge the 12 tribes of Israel and the entire world. He grants them the fullness of power over His word and the authority to carry out the final judgment over all people on earth. So, why 12? Essentially, it symbolizes the power and authority of God.

And also, it is a symbol of the fullness of majesty, dominion, or governing authority that the Lord is giving to His people on earth. The main aspect they possess is the truth and the Word of God itself. He entrusted this mission first to the Old Testament people, the Old Church of Israel, and later, when its function was complete, He entrusted it to the Church, the New Israel. Eventually, this number 12 appears in the heavenly Jerusalem. We see that there are 12 thrones and 12 gates into this castle, this kingdom of heaven. All the people of God will enter through these 12 gates, and this will signify the fullness of completion.  

Additionally, the number 12 is incorporated into the walls of this kingdom and in the number of the people chosen to enter it: 12,000 by 12. In the Book of Revelation, we read that altogether, it will be 144,000 people. Of course, this is not an exact number. It is impossible, in a vision given to the Apostle John, for him to count precisely 144,000 and not 145,000. This number is symbolic, representing the fullness of people who will be taken into the kingdom of heaven.  

Let us remember these things. We see this number in other places in the Old Testament as well. Aaron, the high priest, had a breastplate with 12 precious stones affixed to it, symbolizing that the 12 tribes of Israel would be served through him, and he would establish the connection between them and God. Later, when Jesus fed the 5,000 men, along with women and children, He broke five loaves and two fish. The apostles gathered 12 baskets of leftover pieces of food, which also signifies the fullness of the New Israel, all of whom will be fed by the food of life—the Word of God.  

Let us reflect on this, for the language of the Bible is rich in symbolism. It carries many symbolic meanings and associations, and the number 12 appears frequently. Some have counted it appearing 187 times in the Bible, with about 22 occurrences in the Book of Revelation alone. Let us now consider this and pray that the Lord includes us in the number of the chosen. Let us remain faithful to Him so that we may carry out the mission He has entrusted to His Church. God bless.
