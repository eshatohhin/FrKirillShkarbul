# How is Orthodox Mission different from other missions

Dear brothers and sisters, sometimes people ask me why Catholics and Protestants are more active in terms of mission. They arrive earlier in some countries to conduct missions, such as in China, the Philippines, and South America. The Orthodox, on the other hand, come much later, and their mission efforts are not as extensive as, say, the Catholic mission, which produces thousands of missionaries and operates with large budgets, and so on. Similarly, Protestants, who are mission-oriented—indeed, some groups are entirely mission-oriented—raise the question: why is Orthodoxy different?

The difference lies in the fundamental motivation behind the mission. It's not merely a matter of historical circumstances or other external factors. These are secondary. The significant difference is in the basic motivation and inspiration that people have regarding the mission. This motivation is not unique to Catholics and Protestants. We observe that mission activities were very active in Buddhism and Hinduism as well. Hinduism, for instance, spread as far as Indonesia and Bali. Islam also conducted extensive missions, conquering many countries. In ancient times, there were substantial missions by monotheistic and other gnostic sects. Additionally, other heresies like Monophysitism, Nestorianism, and Arianism were much more widespread than Orthodoxy in those days, particularly in the 4th century.

Therefore, the scope and size of a mission do not necessarily indicate the truth or correctness of a religion. They tell us something else. We will discover that all these missions, not just those of Catholics and Protestants, but all of them, are driven by mammon. Mammon takes different shapes and forms, but there is a common thread. There is something common in that behind these missions lies a passion. It could be vainglory—thinking, "I'm such a great missionary," and so on, trying to influence many people. It could be pride. It could be a desire for money, power, or the establishment of sects. We have many modern sects today, such as Falun Gong and others, where they worship humans, like a prominent figure, and many other things. Research has shown that most of these sects are primarily about money. It's a lucrative business, as seen in Scientology and other groups.

There could also be irrational motivations because it's all spiritual. It's not just about calculation, money, or power—not always. Very often, there is some spirit, some evil spirit behind it. And this evil spirit can be very irrational. You can see it in the glowing eyes of people obsessed with going out and preaching to everyone, trying to convert them to their sect. We see this with Charismatics, Jehovah's Witnesses, and many others. These people are essentially demon-possessed. It's a matter of grasping, of stealing as many souls as possible. Thus, the motivation for a mission can be very far removed from Christ and the Holy Spirit.

Now, returning to Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox, we can see that the Protestant mission is a reaction to Catholicism. It encompasses many aspects. First, let's discuss Catholicism. What drives the mission in Catholicism? The primary driver behind this mission is the desire to spread Catholicism everywhere, aiming for world domination. This domination is very political. The goal is to bring people to recognize the Pope and accept a fixed set of beliefs. That's it. Everything else—your spiritual life, everything—doesn't matter. You have this set of beliefs, you recognize the Pope, and you are part of us. So, there is a lot of military logic behind it, with a strong emphasis on politics. We can see this, for example, in the mission to China. They arrived and tried to convince the Emperor and the higher elite to become Catholic, with the aim of making the entire country Catholic. Thus, it's very much political. And when it comes to politics, it disregards everything else—the Gospel, self-sacrifice, righteousness, and morals.

This is why the means—any means—are considered acceptable as long as the goal is right: *Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam*, "For the greater glory of God." This is a perversion of Christianity. It preaches something other than Christ. It preaches, "Subdue, conquer the whole world." The Protestant mission, in turn, became a child of Catholicism. It inherited all this military rhetoric, the rhetoric of grasping everyone everywhere. They began contesting each other, leading to the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. In this struggle, they expanded their efforts to the entire world. First, they fought in Europe, and when they realized they couldn't conquer each other there, they turned their sights to the rest of the world. This is when the great drive for missionary expansion began.

The way they sought to conquer the world during colonial times was rooted in military power. A military force would arrive, destroy entire countries, devastate nature, obliterate cultures, and enslave people. Then, in the resulting rubble—a destroyed desert—missionaries would come and say, "Now we bring you the love of Christ." Of course, if you didn't accept it, you would face death, misery, or marginalization. You wouldn't have a good place in the new colonial structure. That was the reality back then. It is a great mercy that the Orthodox Church did not participate in this bloody business.

The same methods were used by Protestant missions. No matter where you look, you can see this pattern. The Dutch, the British, and others employed similar tactics. While the colonial era has passed, the methods have evolved. Now, missions are often based on providing relief and material goods, especially after World War II. For example, here in Taiwan, the Catholic Church is known as the "Bread Church" because it distributed flour, bread, and other supplies to those who converted to Catholicism. If you didn't convert, you were left to suffer—hungry and marginalized. This memory remains deeply ingrained in people's minds, and it has left a bitter legacy. People are also aware of the Catholic Church's political involvement, which continues to this day. Protestant political involvement is even more pronounced. In Taiwan, most Protestants align with the green, democratic, and progressive movements, advocating for Taiwan independence and similar agendas. This is far removed from Christ.

Modern missions, especially those of sects, employ psychological methods to persuade people. They aim to reprogram, brainwash, and make individuals dependent on them, viewing the mission as their savior rather than becoming healthy in Christ. They build schools, universities, and hospitals, providing earthly benefits in exchange for acceptance. This is anti-Christian. If your message begins with material offerings, it is not rooted in repentance and truth from the Lord. It is based on the idea that because we give you good, earthly things, you must believe us.

Having said all this, what can we say about the mission of the true Orthodox Church of Christ? Historically, we can find many mistakes, but the basic spirit of the mission is rooted in receiving redemption and renewal from Christ. It begins with deep repentance, which gives birth to a love for Christ and a desire to exert every effort in ministry to Him, returning that love. This is the great motivation to share this love with others. This has been the essence of the Church's mission from its very beginning.

We see this in the way Christ surrounded Himself with former harlots, tax collectors, and sinners. These individuals, once outcasts, became His first disciples and apostles. The Orthodox mission, at its core, seeks to emulate this spirit—not through coercion, politics, or material incentives, but through the transformative power of Christ's love and the call to repentance.

They went and preached the Gospel to the whole world. The same is true for any successful mission in the Orthodox Church, whether it was the conversion of the Roman Empire, the missions to Persia, Georgia, or Russia. These missions were always based on a few individuals who were driven by zeal born of deep repentance. It was never an attempt to create a large organization to subjugate everyone under the authority of Rome or the Pope. It was never like that. Nor was it initially supported by any worldly power. Sometimes, emperors and kings were converted, but it was never the case that someone thought, "I am a king; I need more power, so I will become Christian or Orthodox." No, it was never like that.

The true Gospel, the true message of Christ, stands against mammon—against the worldly desires for power, money, and control. It is about repentance and breaking free from attachment to this world. It is about understanding that your kingdom is in heaven. This is what it is all about. Therefore, the Orthodox mission has always gone against the trend, against the spirit of this world, unlike Catholic and Protestant missions. It was never characterized by the kind of exalted fervor seen in figures like Loyola, with his burning fire, meditations, floggings, and other extreme practices. Instead, it was always guided by the spirit of the Lord—a spirit of humility, truth, self-sacrifice, peace, and calmness.

May the Lord inspire and motivate each of us for such ministry. Every one of us has the potential to become a missionary. First, we can become missionaries in our daily lives, not as professionals, but in the way we live with others. We can express love, warmth, self-sacrifice, and a willingness to help others. We can witness Christ's love to those around us every day. Additionally, we can consider becoming professional missionaries, not necessarily as priests, but as lay missionaries. With very simple preparation—perhaps a one-year formation—we can join courses, participate in practices, and engage in missionary projects. By seeing how it is done, we gain inspiration and the desire to do it ourselves.

All of this is very beneficial and pleasing to the Lord. You might think, "I have other plans, a career, or life goals that I would have to sacrifice." But you will find that if you sacrifice a little for Christ, you will receive manifold compensation in terms of joy. You will see it. It will be a difficult path, a way of the cross, but it will also be blessed and joyful.

May the Lord help each of us, giving us motivation, wisdom, and guidance. May He protect us from the evil spirits driving non-Orthodox, heretical missions. We want to be true followers of the Holy Apostles, preaching the true Gospel to everyone in this world. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
