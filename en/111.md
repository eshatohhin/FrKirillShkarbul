# if we fail to endure the lockdown, we will be conquered

Dear brothers and sisters, the world today is somewhat the reverse of what it was at the beginning of the Christian era.  
We saw that the pagan Roman Empire fell because of Christianity, because of the Church and the saints.  
They had the patience to endure all kinds of sufferings, persecutions, pressures, and restrictions.  
Spiritually, they won. They had a much stronger vision and a much stronger will than the pagan world.  
And this victory overthrew Satan, who was unable to control the whole society.  

What is happening now is somewhat the reverse. The devil has accumulated so much experience and strategies for seducing people and whole societies.  
Now he is trying to seduce the entire world, to eventually build the regime of the Antichrist, step by step. It's progressing like a war, where the enemy is taking chunks of the opposing army, piece by piece.  
In World War II, they tried to take another chunk, but the defense was too strong. The army was too resilient. They were unable to succeed and were pushed back.  
This is what is happening now. The Antichrist is trying to gain control over different aspects of human life—spiritual, societal, economic, and many others.  

In the past 50 years, the groundwork was being laid, but in recent times, it has accelerated rapidly. You know what I'm talking about, right? In the last year and a half, they have been trying to push it forward quickly.  

There are two ways the devil, as an enemy in any kind of war, seeks to overthrow his opponent. One way is if the enemy is a bad guy trying to overthrow a good guy.  
The first method is to create pressure on the enemy and break their will, forcing them to surrender.  
The second way is to use blackmail or threats, such as saying, "We will harm your family," which can lead to surrender.  
These two methods are related. Both involve applying pressure—threatening that something bad will happen to you, your family, or something you care about—until you reach a point where you can no longer endure and say, "I give up."  

So, what is happening now is a competition of wills. In ancient times, we saw how the will of the Christians and the Church overcame the will of the pagans, who were also striving for something but ultimately failed.  
Now, we face a will that is trying to break us, and we are much weaker than the Christians of the early Church. Our faith and will are much weaker, and we lack the clear vision they possessed at that time.  
This is why the devil hopes we will say, "It's enough; I have failed." We have many examples of this competition of wills.  
In a family, two spouses may have different opinions and ideas. In the end, it comes down to willpower. Who is stronger in will, who is willing to wait longer? The other may fail at some point.  
It doesn’t matter if they are right or wrong—they can still fail. The same principle applies in spiritual life. A sinful idea may come to our mind, and we resist it, refusing to act on it.  
But eventually, it tries to convince us, "This is the only way; you have to do it. Without it, you will suffer, and you won’t be able to bear it."  
At some point, we fail and say, "I can’t wait any longer; I can’t fight anymore," and we give in.  

So, the goal is to endure through it all, grow stronger, and ultimately win.  
We see in the Revelation of John that the Lord says, "Write to the angel of the church in Pergamum: endure until death, and I will give you the crown of life."  
You need to have patience—great patience.  

So, our task now must be—I think you know what I’m talking about, right?  
Our task must be to endure, no matter how long it takes—one year, two years, or fifty years. If I need to endure an unpleasant situation, I will do it.  
It’s inconvenient, and we face so much pressure and challenges, but we must persevere.

When the Antichrist comes, he will also employ this tactic. He will say, "You need to be part of the system. I must place my mark on you—some on the right hand, some on the forehead—and without it, you cannot buy or sell."  
This means your children cannot attend school, you cannot travel, and you are essentially locked down. Without the mark, you become an outcast, even illegal.  
People will say, "It’s so inconvenient to be without it. I cannot abandon my family." The system will always present seemingly good reasons for compliance.  
It will urge you, "Look at your family. Don’t think about yourself; think about your family, think about others, think about their health."  
It will find countless ways to persuade you to accept the mark, and most people will succumb.  

We see this pattern in history. Regimes like the Nazis began with policies that seemed logical and convincing, appealing to the greater good.  
Initially, the population embraced these policies, believing they were for the benefit of society.  
It was only later that the true cruelty and oppression were revealed.  
The same happened with communism. Why did so many people follow and believe in it?  
Because it appeared convincing, promising to fight against "bad guys" and work for the people’s benefit.  
But eventually, it led to the Gulags, widespread persecution, and the near-destruction of the Church.  

Before any revolution, there is always a competition of wills, often lasting decades.  
The Russian Revolution, for example, followed 50 years of intense preparation.  
People grew weary of heavy burdens, low wages, economic troubles, and eventually, war.  
The monarchy, under constant pressure, eventually collapsed, saying, "I cannot bear this anymore."  
Then came the revolution and all its consequences.  

What is happening now follows a similar pattern. There has been at least 50 years of preparation for the current situation.  
Now, they hope to seize the entire "chunk" and advance to the next level.  
But our task is to endure with patience, no matter how long it takes—50 years, or any number of years.  

There is a story about Saint Savva of Palestine. Once, the monastery had no food.  
The manager came and said, "We have no food, so we will not call the brethren for the common meal after the Divine Liturgy this weekend."  
Saint Savva replied, "The Lord said, 'Do not worry about earthly things; seek the spiritual, and I will provide what you need.'  
Let us pray and trust. Call the brethren."  
The night before, 30 cows arrived, loaded with grain, food, and drinks, donated by people moved to generosity.  
When the manager saw this, he was ashamed and repented, saying, "Forgive me for my lack of faith."  

This teaches us that we must endure as long as necessary.  
The devil and the Antichrist are like a cardio machine or a training tool.  
If you run or lift weights, you grow stronger. But if you give up, saying, "I’m tired," you are cast aside.  
The same principle applies here. As Jesus said, "If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles."  
We must endure, grow stronger, and remain steadfast in our faith, no matter the challenges we face.

You want to impose a lockdown for five years? I’m ready for ten, I’m ready for twenty. At the very least, we must have this resolve in our hearts.  
Let us be strong in our will for Christ, for the ministry of the Lord, to endure any length of trial—be it persecution, hardship, or whatever comes our way.  
And we will win. We know from history, like the Cold War, where two wills competed for 30 or 40 years, and eventually, the socialist camp fell.  
This was not a direct, hard conflict, but a battle of endurance. Very often, this is how victory is achieved.  

The devil uses this strategy to conquer people, to win back their souls and enslave them to sin, to his way of life, social relationships, and ideologies.  
He hopes that everyone will grow tired, sick, and weary, and simply surrender.  
But let us not surrender. Let us be strong. Let us be soldiers of Christ, fortresses that withstand all kinds of pressure and all forms of seduction the devil may bring against us.  

Let us rely on our Lord. We have His support and His power. We simply need to learn how to depend on Him and use this power so that our faith does not grow weak.  
What is happening now? Why are we losing ground? Because we are weak in faith and too attached to this world.  
We need to grow stronger spiritually and be prepared to endure for as long as necessary.  

May the Lord help us, bless us, and fill us with joy. God bless.
