# Why are we passive Spiritual EgyptSlavery

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about activity in the Church, of the Church, and of every Christian.  
Why are we so passive? We are often passive in our mission, in any activity, because we have not yet understood what it truly means to follow Christ.  
He said, "If you want to be my disciples, you need to take up your cross and follow me."  
But do we understand, practically speaking, what this means? This lack of understanding is why we live in a form of slavery.  
And if we ourselves are enslaved by something, how can we preach freedom to others?  

You might ask, "What are we enslaved by? We are free people. We can do whatever we want."  
But if that were truly the case, there would be no need for Christ’s call to take up our cross and follow Him.  
Consider the disciples: they were fishermen, and when Jesus said, "Follow me," they left everything and followed Him.  
Then there was the rich man who came and asked, "What else must I do to inherit the kingdom of heaven?"  
The Lord told him, "Sell everything you have and follow me." The rich man was not free. He had wealth and property, but he was not spiritually free. This is why he had to abandon it all to follow Christ.  

What does this mean for us in our daily lives, in our attitude toward life?  
It means we need to learn how to step out of our comfort zones.  
We live in a world, or we try to build a world, that is comfortable for us.  
This is what we call "Egypt"—spiritual Egypt.  
Unless we conquer this Egypt, we will not be able to follow Christ.  

This Egypt can take many forms. For some, it means accumulating wealth: "I buy a lot of real estate, rent it out, and secure a stable, comfortable life for my old age."  
But in doing so, they become slaves to their possessions, constantly worrying about maintaining them.  
For others, it’s the desire to immigrate to another country, believing it will bring a better life. Yet, this too can become a form of slavery.  
Some marry for financial security, and that becomes their bondage.  
The devil always offers something in exchange for our freedom. Nothing comes without a cost.  
In this trade, we think we gain something, but we lose our true spiritual freedom and drift further from God.  

This is the problem of church secularization.  
When the Church relies too heavily on government, financial resources, or material possessions, it begins to lose its essence.  
It becomes less like the Church and more like an organization or a club.  
This is what happened to many Christians and even to the Roman Church, which relied on power, central government, and total control.  
It became like the Jews of Christ’s time, who thought they controlled everything. But the Lord overturned it all and destroyed the temple.  
The Old Testament religion ceased to exist, and the Christian Church became its heir.  
Yet, the temptation of power and control did not disappear. It entered the Church and remains there today.  

There are two paths to this slavery.  
One is the totalitarian path, where control and power dominate.  
The other is individualism, where people say, "I don’t care about anyone else; I decide for myself. I am free, and that’s all that matters."  
But in this mindset, a person becomes a slave to their old self.  
This is what we call the "internal Pharaoh"—the ruler within us that we cannot escape.  
We think this is the standard for interpreting the Bible, for believing, for living.  
This leads to many Protestant groups becoming little more than clubs, focused on individual preferences rather than the collective mission of the Church.  

Let us strive to break free from these chains, to truly take up our cross, and to follow Christ with all our hearts, minds, and souls. Only then can we live as true disciples and bring His light to the world.

People who have ideas about God that are similar to their own often unite into so-called churches, which can increasingly resemble sects.  
This happens because, without an internal connection to the body of Christ—the true Church of Christ—they lack a mystical, spiritual bond.  
Instead, they embrace all kinds of misguided ideas, leading them to become like a sect or even a cult.  
This stems from our fallen nature, our fantasies about religion and spirituality, and the influence of evil spirits.  
There are countless sects, cults, and heresies that arise from these distortions.  

These temptations—whether from the "internal Pharaoh" within us or the "external Pharaoh" of worldly systems—are still present today.  
Even within the Orthodox Church, though perhaps not as severely, these temptations exist.  
We must overcome them if we are to become active in our mission.  
After all, how can we preach freedom to others if we ourselves are enslaved?  

Often, the missions of other religions or non-Orthodox Christian groups are very active.  
Why? Because they rely on some form of slavery—be it money, power, influence, or other external resources.  
These tools leave people with little choice but to accept or embrace what is being offered.  
But Christ brought a very different spirit.  
He never relied on external resources. Even His miracles were performed only for those who already believed.  
To others, He avoided performing miracles and kept His identity as the Messiah a secret.  
He wanted people to discover the truth for themselves, to come to faith freely, and to follow Him willingly.  
Salvation belongs to those who are truly free, who can break away from their "Pharaoh."  

What other forms of slavery exist?  
Many "isms"—communism, socialism, capitalism, nationalism—are rooted in some form of slavery.  
In religion, Catholicism and Protestantism also contain elements of slavery, as I’ve already discussed.  
This reveals that we must be brave enough to step out of our comfort zones.  
Slavery can be deceptively comfortable, like Egypt in biblical times.  
You have food, security, and everything you need—but at the cost of your freedom.  

This is precisely what was discussed at the Davos Forum last January.  
The vision presented was a world without private property or privacy, but with guaranteed happiness.  
You would have everything you need and be content with your life.  
This utopian vision is, in reality, slavery taken to its logical conclusion.  
It is the kingdom of the Antichrist, which will one day come to pass.  

We must not seek a comfortable life—one free of problems, with financial stability and security.  
Instead, we must seek the kingdom of heaven.  
We must avoid becoming slaves to comfort, consumption, or our jobs.  
But we must also guard against becoming "pharaohs" ourselves.  

A pharaoh is a slave to his own passions, even as he exercises authority over others.  
Perhaps you have authority over your children, employees, or coworkers.  
Do you treat them with love, as a father or a caring leader?  
Or do you treat them in a legalistic, authoritarian way, asserting your rights over them?  
When we act like pharaohs, we enslave those under us.  
Our families, which should be small churches, become totalitarian structures.  
Our organizations become mere clubs, where members are superficially free but lack true spiritual unity.  

Let us strive to break free from these chains—both as individuals and as communities.  
Only then can we truly follow Christ, preach freedom, and build the kingdom of heaven on earth.

So, let us be brave—not afraid to lose our comfort, not nervous, but strong soldiers of Christ, preaching the spiritual freedom that He has given us.  
May our Lord bless us and fill us with eagerness and daring, so that we may put the kingdom of heaven first and foremost in our priorities.  
God bless you. Stay away from slavery.
