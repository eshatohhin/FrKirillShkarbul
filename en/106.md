# How can the New World Order split the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about two topics and the connection between them.  
The first is the splitting of the Church. How is it possible? How has it been done in the past? And how might it happen in the future?  
The second topic is the New World Order that we are moving toward.  

Someone is trying to push us into this New World Order.  
Why am I talking about this? Because the Church must carry out its mission.  
It must bear witness to the true faith in Christ, no matter the social setting or revolution we face.  
No matter what, we must do this. We need to be prepared and ready for what is coming.  
We know from revelation and from Christ Himself that there will be a second coming and that an Antichrist will appear before that.  
So, we must recognize the signs of the times and understand that these events are approaching.  

The devil wants to split the Church. In the past, he succeeded in dividing the Church—Rome split away, the Old Believers separated from the Russian Church, and there have been both major and minor schisms. Now, a significant split is coming, and we must think about this now.  
Some people are preoccupied with thoughts of the Antichrist, the Mark of the Beast, and how to avoid it—how to flee to the forest and so on.  
But the greater problem is not that. The greater problem is the impending split of the Church.  
We must avoid it, and we must think about it now. Why is it coming? Where is it coming from?  

In the past, we have seen major changes. The most recent example was the Russian Revolution, which caused a significant portion of the Russian Church to split away, forming the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia due to the social and political changes in the Soviet Union.  
With the Lord’s help, we restored unity in 2007. However, things may not go as smoothly next time.  
We must think about this now.  

What is happening in the world right now? As I’ve mentioned before, the devil sets a trap. He opens it, lures you in, and then closes it.  
First, he gives you power, and later, he gains power over you. He makes you addicted to something, and then he controls you.  
This is how he works. This is the trap. As we pray, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.”  
Temptation is the trap, and humanity is slipping into it. We have been asleep in the past.  

Revolutions—whether the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, or any other—promise freedom and equality.  
But then a tyrant emerges, kills many people, imposes a new ideology, and changes the way people think and live.  
We have seen this happen repeatedly.  

In the past, societies were more hierarchical and patriarchal, resembling kingdoms. The Kingdom of God is also a kingdom, where there is respect for the Lord who is above us.  
Today, there is no piety, no sense of holiness, no respect for hierarchy. Families are no longer hierarchical, and corporations have become flat. Everyone knows about the flattening of corporate structures.  
All of this stems from the same temptation: “Be free, be equal.” It is the same temptation that says, “Don’t trust authority. Authority is a despot, a tyrant.”  

We saw this with Adam and Eve when the devil told them, “Don’t trust God. He isn’t telling you the truth. I will tell you the truth. You will be free. You will know good and evil, and you will be like God.  
You will have freedom and your own life, not bound by obedience. You don’t need obedience.”  
This same temptation reappears every time there is a major revolution that flattens society and dismantles its structures.

We no longer have any aristocracy or genuine royal structure. We are just individuals—men and women—living in a mass culture dominated by mass media. Everything is very practical and down-to-earth.  
Everyone can buy and sell anything. Families have become mere partnerships. Society has become very flat and profane, with little interest in the holy or sacred on a general level.  
This is the result of the devil’s trap. People have been ensnared. In the past, this happened on a local level, with revolutions in different countries. Now, it is happening on a global scale.  

By examining what happened in the past, we can understand what is likely to occur now on a global level. Locally, after such changes, the general population entered into a new social contract, a new form of relationship.  
There was an elite that controlled everything, and there were marginalized groups—such as LGBTQ individuals—who were either imprisoned, sent to concentration camps, ghettoized, or exiled to other countries.  
There were always these three types of people: the general population, the elite, and the marginalized. The same pattern will emerge this time. This is what they want.  

If you recall the 1993 movie *Demolition Man* starring Sylvester Stallone, it depicted a future that aligns with what is being planned now.  
The movie, nearly 30 years old, foreshadowed the kind of society they are trying to create. Many dystopian films and books explore variations of this idea, but the central theme is clear.  

The majority of people will embrace all the new systems: regular vaccinations, smart cities that track your every move, facial recognition, electronic money, and perhaps even microchips.  
The details may vary, but the rules will be strict, and those in power know exactly what they want. They have been planning this for decades, over 50 years specifically for this purpose.  

There will be an elite class that operates above the rules. For example, in the United States, we see elite parties where masks are not worn because they are exempt from the rules. They don’t have to explain themselves, and very few people ever join their ranks.  
If you were part of this elite, you wouldn’t be listening to this message.  

Then there will be the marginalized—those deprived of rights, education, healthcare, jobs, and social status. They will be pushed to the fringes, much like people in third-world countries who die of hunger and neglect.  
These are the people who refuse to conform, who want to decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated, what to read, where to go, and who reject constant surveillance and control.  
They will be marginalized, and perhaps even eliminated.  

In movies and video games, zombies are often depicted as enemies to be killed. These zombies symbolize the anti-vaxxers and non-conformists. Society is being conditioned to view them as threats—people who hate humanity, refuse to obey the rules, and are harmful to society.  

The question is: where will the Church stand in all of this? Will it align with the majority, accepting the rules and serving the elite? Or will it stand with the marginalized, those who resist the system?  
The Church must choose its path carefully, for it will either serve the rulers of this new order or stand as a beacon of truth and resistance. The choice will define its role in the coming times.

The Church will likely find itself in a marginalized position. If this stratification and caste system take hold, the Church will inevitably face a split.  
We cannot be certain where the true Church will stand in this scenario. Some may argue, "No, it’s impossible for the Church to split." But history shows otherwise. People once thought it impossible for Rome to split away, or for parts of the Russian Church to separate, yet it happened.  
This split is entirely possible, and it represents the true challenge ahead.  

Before the revolution, people were preoccupied with trivial concerns. In Russia, there was a trend of building grand cathedrals, and many were worried about priests wearing medals and other superficial matters.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything was demolished. Priests were killed, and the medals no longer mattered because there were no priests left to wear them.  
People were focused on the wrong things, not the real dangers.  

Today, we must ask ourselves: What is the real threat to the Church and our ministry in the near future? One of the greatest dangers is this potential split.  
You might ask, "What can I do as a Christian?" First, we must rise above this division. We must not participate in the promotion of hatred, whether against anti-vaxxers, vaxxers, or any other group.  
We must not engage in these divisive battles.  

Our role is to be above such conflicts. We must stand with the people, unite them, and teach them about sacrifice through our own example.  
We must be prepared to reject the new order if it is imposed upon us. We must do everything in our power to prevent this from happening.  

The powers that be will push this agenda for as long as necessary. We are now entering the third winter of this "fancy sickness," and it will not be the last.  
This will continue until the new system is firmly in place. Our task is to resist and ensure their plan fails. If it does, they will resort to another strategy.  

The Lord will help us in this endeavor. Our resistance is not because we are against technology or progress, but because we want the Church to fulfill its mission faithfully.  
We do not want the Church to be split, marginalized, or confined to a ghetto. We want the Church to speak freely and bear witness to our Lord.  

May the Lord grant us wisdom, strengthen our faith, give us patience, unite our hearts, and lead us to victory over all adversaries. God bless.
