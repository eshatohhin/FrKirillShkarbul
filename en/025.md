# Is Christianity a “culture”

Dear friends, today I want to say a few words about culture and how Christianity relates to culture. Very often, we hear phrases like "Christian culture" being brought to new places, introducing what is perceived as Christian culture. Sometimes, this leads to a collision between different cultures. People speak about Christian culture, post-Christian culture, and other cultures, such as Buddhist or other traditions. This can create the impression that Christianity is a local phenomenon, while in other places, it is something entirely different. This is a great mistake because the message of God, the Covenant of God, is a covenant between God and humanity. Every human being is called to be united with Christ and to become a child of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

Therefore, we need to understand what it means to have a Christian culture. What is Christian culture? And how do we approach inculturation in mission contexts? What does it mean? 

The term "culture" refers to traditions, ways of building relationships, customs, etiquette, clothing, and other elements typical of a particular location. Today, we live in a world of globalization and postmodernism, a world that is increasingly eroding cultural distinctions. People are becoming more and more deculturized. This is not the emergence of a new culture but rather the loss of traditional cultures, which can ultimately lead to the loss of our very humanity. Sometimes, this is tied to sinful ways of thinking and living, which can degrade people to a state worse than that of animals. People may live sinful and miserable lives, believing that this is liberty or freedom, when in reality, it is the loss of basic human values and culture. 

It is important to distinguish these things. What we see in postmodernism is not a culture but an anti-culture—a sickness that seeks to destroy cultural traditions across the globe. However, today, I want to focus on cultures that are genuinely cultures. Even now, if we travel to different countries in Asia or Africa, we will see that people treat each other differently. Even if they speak our language or we communicate in English or their local language, we will find that their values, habits, and many other aspects are distinct. This is what we call the local culture of these places. 

It is crucial to understand that Christianity is not a culture. Christianity is a union with the source of life. Christ gives us true life, bringing the Kingdom of Heaven into our hearts. When we become children of Heaven and children of salvation, we live in a special way. We keep God's commandments, change our values, and transform our fundamental beliefs, which in turn influence our culture. However, this transformation is rooted in something universal—a truth that applies to all people and all nations. 

For example, in every country, we have taxi drivers or people in the same profession, such as police officers. Yet, the culture surrounding these professions varies from one country to another. The basic function of a taxi driver, however, remains the same: to take you from point A to point B. Similarly, Christianity is about the basic truth, the fundamental life and covenant we have with God, which leads us from sin to salvation, freedom, and the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the universal foundation of Christianity.

And later, of course, in different countries and among different peoples, when they receive Christianity, they bring forth different fruits. They may have slightly different clothing, unique iconography, distinct ways of conducting the Divine Liturgy, and other local peculiarities such as chanting and various traditions. These local elements are valuable, yet they do not belong to the fundamental spiritual reality that is given to us through receiving the Body of Christ. This is why, no matter which country you visit or which Orthodox church you enter—whether it is Bulgarian, Serbian, Russian, Greek, or any other—you will receive the same Body of Christ. You will meet your brothers and sisters, one family in Christ. This is the essence of Christianity and the function of the Church: to serve as a bridge from this fallen world, a world tainted by sin, into the world of Christ. We do not depart from this world but unite with the true world, the Kingdom of Heaven, which lives within us. The Divine Liturgy continues in our hearts.

We must remember this truth. When different people become united with Christ, they may need to change certain aspects of their cultures, especially if those cultures are highly intricate and developed. For example, if you want to become a soldier, it is easier to adjust when you are young and have fewer ingrained habits. However, if you are older and have established ways of doing things, it will be more challenging. You will need to sacrifice many habits and practices to become a good soldier. Similarly, if our way of life or culture—perhaps even our personal culture—is filled with elements that conflict with the way of life in Christ, we will need to sacrifice those things. However, we must understand that we are sacrificing only what is contrary to the Word of God. Everything in our culture and personality that is good and valuable will be enlivened by Christ, enabling us to bear even greater fruit and to use our talents to glorify God.

Many aspects of local cultures can be revitalized and infused with new life through Christ, bringing forth even more color and fruit than other cultures or places. Therefore, let us discern what is valuable, what is absolute, and what is relative. Let us remain steadfast in our union with Christ and allow Him to guide us. He will change whatever in our culture needs to be changed, and He will preserve and transform whatever should remain. We need only to approach this process with humility, decisiveness in cutting off sin and evil, and a commitment to erase all that is contrary to God from our hearts and lives. God will guide us, make us His children, and grant us the joy of bearing fruit in His grace.

May the Lord help you and grant you His wisdom and blessing. Amen.
