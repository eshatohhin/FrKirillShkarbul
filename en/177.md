# Half truth Dialectics of satan to subdue the world

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan. I came here to conduct a divine service and to congratulate our faithful. We recently celebrated the marriage of one couple, so life continues to move forward. Today, I want to discuss the deceit that the devil is using to mislead the entire world in these times. He has always employed such tactics, but now it has become so critical that we are facing a great catastrophe. This catastrophe is the construction of the new kingdom of the Antichrist. Like the building behind me, it is symbolic. This new kingdom is being built, and we need to open our eyes to see what is happening. It won't be easy, so please follow my logic. You can also examine it to gain a clear understanding. If we do not grasp the principles of the Antichrist and the devil, we will be misled and become victims of propaganda.

We now hear that half of the world supports Ukraine, the West, the United States, democracy, and similar projects. Meanwhile, the Russians are being persuaded that this is evil, a source of evil, and that they need to liberate humanity from this unipolar world, which is filled with what they call "Sodomite propaganda," anti-Christian ideologies, and nonsensical concepts like "parent number one" and "parent number two." These are seen as destructive, anti-Christian, and Satanic ways of living and thinking. This antagonism is being created, but if we listen carefully to both sides, we will see that it is fake. What people say, what we hear from the media, and what is actually being done do not align. Both sides are lying to us—not outright lies, but half-truths.

Today, I want to talk about the difference between truth and half-truth. We live in an evil world, and evil means not true, relative. The modern world tells us that everything is relative: good and bad, truth and falsehood. What is true for you may not be true for me, and vice versa. This way of thinking is evident in ancient Chinese Taoist philosophy, which speaks of yin and yang, where everything is relative. We see it in Marx's dialectics, which also claim that everything is relative. Capitalism has its principles, and socialism has its own. This antagonism is said to drive progress for humanity. But this progress is essentially the building of the Tower of Babel. Today, people from all nations are being drawn into one of these camps. We once had the capitalist camp and the socialist camp, but after the changes in the late 1980s, a new global division is emerging. It is openly stated that by 2030, the United States will no longer be the sole superpower; there will be multiple centers of power. The globalist agenda aims to create a divided world, possibly even one in conflict. This fits well into the overall plan.

Today, I want to discuss the devil's method of using dialectics to claim that truth is relative. Why do I say this is fake? Why do I say it is not true? Even in the Bible, we see that God allows the devil to exist. The devil is the antagonist, and God finds some use in his presence. The devil tempts and seduces people, but this temptation helps us grow stronger. There is a kind of dialectic at play here. In Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 14, he speaks of the Jews who did not accept Jesus Christ. Through their fall, the Gentiles gained faith and salvation. As it is written in Romans 11:11, "Have they stumbled so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious." This shows that even in their fall, there is a purpose, and through it, others may be awakened.

The idea is that the Jews fell away so that the Gentiles, who comprise the Church of Christ, might be even more fervent in their faith because of the persecutions and hatred that surround Christians. There was a divine purpose in their fall, a plan that allowed the Church to grow stronger and overcome temptations. The Jews, in their rejection of the truth and holiness, became like the devil, and the project of the Antichrist is a continuation of what began at that time. The Lord allows this to happen so that the Church can be strengthened and rise above these challenges. Indeed, there is a reasoning behind this dialectic understanding.

However, the devil's lie is in claiming that the two opposing poles—such as good and evil, or capitalism and socialism—are of equal status, both relative and equally important. This is false. The Lord is the truth, and He told His disciples that their answers should be clear: "Yes" is yes, and "no" is no. Anything beyond this is from the devil. Relativism, where "yes" might sometimes mean "no," is a deception. Half-truths are lies. For example, if your wife is only half-loyal, it is not loyalty at all—it is adultery. You cannot be half-pregnant; it is an absolute state. When the devil uses dialectics, he is lying. Whether it is capitalism versus socialism or the United States versus Russia, these dichotomies are already lies. The truth lies elsewhere.

The devil seeks to secularize the Church, to make it worldly and a victim of his schemes. This is why it is dangerous for the Church to align too closely with any government or ideology. It risks being drawn into revolutions and conflicts, becoming a pawn in the devil's game. His goal is to build the kingdom of the Antichrist, destroying human lives, morals, and cultures in the process. Nearly everywhere, cultures have already been eroded. Ultimately, his plan is to destroy the Church. We must be aware of his schemes, seeing beyond the propaganda from both pro-Western and pro-Russian media. The truth is not found in the news, which offers only half-truths and partial pictures. There is a collusion of forces behind these conflicting parties, and ordinary people—Russians, Ukrainians, and others—are suffering and dying in these conflicts.

Let us pray that the Lord spares His people and thwarts the plans of the Antichrist, who seeks to subjugate humanity and force acceptance of his kingdom as the only reality. The Antichrist aims to unify all processes under his rule, presenting his way as the objective truth. He will claim there is no alternative, that everyone must accept his world as the only reality. This "objective truth" will stand in opposition to the true Savior, Jesus Christ. It will be a counterfeit reality that people will be compelled to embrace.

Let us recognize the plans of the Antichrist and the devil to mislead us, drawing us into processes that make us his victims. We must remain steadfast in Christ, rejecting these deceptions, so that we may gain salvation and not fall prey to the devil's schemes.

Thank you very much for listening. If this was a bit too complicated or philosophical, I apologize. However, I believe it is crucial for us to understand the devil's plan—his logic and how he seeks to deceive and trick us. By grasping this, we can become wiser and stand firmly with the Lord, aligned with His truth. Only through Him can we find true salvation.

For us, there is no room for compromise with evil. We hate everything that opposes the Lord and stands with the devil. We reject all that is evil, and we refuse any dialogue or compromise with it. The truth, salvation, and life are absolute, not relative. May the Lord keep us steadfast in His truth and bless us abundantly.

God bless you all.
