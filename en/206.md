# Pascha Victory of the devil Brings Victory to God (Part 2)

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
We will celebrate Pascha until the Ascension, for forty days.  
For forty days, the Lord, the resurrected Christ, appeared to His disciples,  
and they could not tell whether they were in the heavens already or still on this earth.  
Thus, it is a time of special joy when the heavens are open,  
and when we partake in this resurrection.  
Life is brought to us abundantly.  
I hope that you can also feel, at least to some extent,  
that the time we are going through now is very special,  
very different from any other time.  
And I also want to share with you what this practically means.  

One of the aspects of the life that the Lord is giving to us  
in this daily life involves even society, economics, politics, and other things,  
because the Lord comes and involves Himself in this world as the resurrected Christ.  
He said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."  
So, we see that He Himself came and had a mission from the Father in this physical world.  
In the same way, we continue His mission.  
But practically, what does this mean?  
We can discuss it from different perspectives,  
but today I want to speak about the crushing of Leviathan.  
Leviathan is the prince of this world.  
The Lord Himself fell victim to this prince.  
He was killed by the prince of this world,  
for Judas betrayed Him out of greed for money,  
and the Pharisees and chief priests acted out of their own greed and hatred toward Him and others.  
Not all Jews, but many, desired the prince of this world.  
They wanted the Antichrist and became children of the devil.  
And they succeeded in their aim.  
They sought to destroy Him, the man Jesus,  
and they accomplished it.  
However, through His death, the Lord overthrew death.  
He rose and brought salvation to all of us.  

Does this mean that Judas was a good guy and that he was supposed to betray Jesus?  
No.  
We do not justify any evil.  
In the Lord, there is no evil.  
There is no darkness.  
He hates everything sinful and impure.  
This Asian-Daoist idea that good and evil are merely two sides of the same coin is too simplistic.  
Dualism existed in ancient Greece and elsewhere,  
and in many nations, this dualistic thinking persists even nowâ€”  
the belief that good and evil are two sides of some reality and that both must exist.  
Even modern-day Talmudic Judaism holds this view,  
that there is no true evil,  
that evil can also bring about something good.  
This is a grave mistake,  
and it leads people to serve the devil,  
for they use evil, thinking it is good.  

Now, the Lord Himself can use the outcomes of evil for a good purpose.  
This does not mean He justifies evil,  
but He is so wise and benevolent that He can bring good from it.  
Today, I want to say a few words about this world, which is growing worse and worse.  
Evil is increasing, lies are increasing, and many other things are escalating.  
Since the 1970s, even the mass media is no longer expected to bring truth.  
There has been a paradigm shift.  
Of course, this is as old as humanity itself, but it is worsening.  
We see more and more falsehoods presented to us as truth.  
Yet, we can still derive benefit from this.  

So today, I want to discuss why the Lord allows evil to happen  
and what good can be extracted from it.  
But this benefit is only for those who love Jesus Christ.  
This is crucial, for those who do not love Him,  
who have not become true followers of Christ,  
will be harmed by this evil and will face death and condemnation.  

Why is this so?  
First, let us look at the Lord Himself, and then we will return to the modern-day situation.  
The Lord Himself was killed, and this act of evil brought about His resurrection.
