# Pascha in the World of Total Godlessness

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
The Holy Church celebrates Pascha, and we are filled with the joy of Christ's resurrection, which brings true life to each of us. It gives us hope for our own resurrection, and we already feel it. However, for the world at large, this event holds little significance. We have celebrated Pascha, yet the world continues as usual. Wars persist, agendas dominate, and all kinds of problems and issues remain. The world moves forward, consumed by its own concerns—what we read in the news, what is happening around us. For most, Pascha is perhaps just a time when some Orthodox Christians celebrate. To the world as a whole, it holds little importance.  

Even among Christians, even among Orthodox Christians, Pascha is often reduced to a time of special celebration. We decorate the church, we observe traditions, we do what is expected because it is Pascha. Then it ends—a big meal, eating, drinking, and then it’s over. "Pascha is finished. What’s next? Let’s prepare for what’s next." This reveals that even we, the so-called Christians, Orthodox Christians, are far removed from the living experience of the Lord and the resurrection that Pascha brings to us.  

There is one concept that can summarize all these phenomena. In the realm of religion, there are so many beliefs—pantheism, Confucianism, various forms of paganism, different factions of Islam, atheism, and more. It’s all so complicated. In terms of worldview, there are modernists, postmodernists, post-postmodernists, liberals, and others. In philosophy, you might align with Heidegger, Bergson, or Wittgenstein. Yet, many people don’t care about any of this—religion, philosophy, or worldview. They simply live to enjoy life, day by day, without giving these matters any thought. Most people are like this.  

Despite the apparent diversity, it all boils down to one thing: godlessness. Sometimes people think it’s about ethics, but it’s not. Godlessness is any lifestyle, doctrine, religion, philosophy, or belief that does not live with the Lord, for the Lord, or for the true Lord. This includes distorted forms of Christianity, heresies that reject the Holy Spirit and the holy tradition of the Church, seeking alternative paths. These, too, are forms of godlessness.  

The whole world has slipped into godlessness, though it takes different forms and shapes. It’s all the same thing, varying only in degree. I’m not speaking in absolutes of black or white—it can be better or worse, but it is all godlessness. We live in a world of total godlessness, which grows worse by the day. Often, we don’t want to see it or acknowledge it for what it is. When we live as though there is no God, that is godlessness. It doesn’t require being a great sinner or living a life of overt evil. Simply living day to day, seeking enjoyment, nice dinners, entertainment, and routine—without God, without thinking of the Lord, without changing our hearts, without asceticism, without breaking away from our old selves to follow the Lord and the Gospel—this is godlessness.

So, we can say there is *practical godlessness* and *theoretical godlessness*. Theoretical godlessness might apply to scholars, theologians, or philosophers who delve into research and consciously adopt ideologies like Marxism, environmentalism, or humanism. They choose a system of thought or religion, often with seriousness and intent, but it is one that stands against the Lord. They create idols out of their chosen beliefs, distancing themselves from God.  

However, most people do not even reach this level of theoretical godlessness. Instead, they live in what I call *practical godlessness*. This is not my own observation but is rooted in the work of Professor Alexander Biliayev, a theologian at the Moscow Theological Academy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In his writings, he analyzed various forms of godlessness throughout history, from ancient Greece and Rome to his own time. He noted how godlessness manifested in different ways, even before Christ.  

The Lord Himself warned that most people choose the broad way rather than the narrow path. He spoke of a corrupt and sinful generation, adulterers and sinners. Yet, even in those days, the world was in a better state than it is today. If we look back just 30 or 40 years, we see a stark contrast in how people lived, thought, and related to one another. Society was more stable, relationships were deeper, and people were more committed to their work, their spouses, and their communities. There were heroes—people who sacrificed their lives for their country during the World Wars, for example.  

Today, loyalty and dedication are rare. People chase better opportunities, moving from one place to another without deep roots. Relationships have become shallow, reduced to text messages and emojis. The inner lives of people are often empty or filled with distractions—endless hours spent on computer games or other trivial pursuits. Even the arts have declined; where once there were great composers and profound music, today we are surrounded by what can only be described as noise.  

The world is changing rapidly, and not for the better. Despite technological advancements—new iPhones, gadgets, and so-called progress—we are losing something far more valuable. If we continue down this path, we risk becoming worse than animals, driven by base instincts and devoid of the image of God. Technology, in such a state, becomes not a tool for good but a means of further harm.  

I share these observations not to frighten anyone but to remind us all that we, as Christians, are called to be different from this world. We must not align ourselves with its values, its lifestyle, its manners, or its way of thinking. The world of godlessness is fallen, ugly, and sinful. The movies we watch, the culture we consume—they often glorify not bravery or virtue but the illusion of becoming gods without the true God.  

We must resist this. We must live as people set apart, reflecting the image of God in a world that has forgotten Him. Let us not be swept away by the shallow currents of this age but remain steadfast in our faith, our values, and our commitment to the Lord.

That is the impression from the devil. When we serve only ourselves, caring solely about our comfort, health, well-being, and beauty, we make idols of ourselves. This is idol worship. I am not saying we should neglect these things entirely, but when they become the sole focus of our lives, we become enemies of Christ. We betray Him and fall into godlessness, becoming a faithless and unbelieving people.  

May the Lord save us from all these delusions and temptations. May He help us preserve our hearts and souls, uncorrupted and undefiled by the evil that surrounds us in this world. May He heal our wounds through the power of His resurrection and enlighten us with His light, so that we may see the so-called light of progress and civilization for what it truly is: darkness, harmful and vain, full of pride and madness.  

May the Lord help us and grant us His blessing. Indeed, Christ is risen—He is truly risen!
