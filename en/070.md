# About mission in Taiwan

Dear brothers and sisters, I'm recording today's video in response to a question from one of the subscribers about the mission in Taiwan. Well, the mission in Taiwan, the Orthodox mission, was formed and began in 1901 by Saint Nicholas of Japan. He sent the first priest at that time, Father Simeon Yukawa, to Taipei to open the parish and also in Taichung. At that time, there were some catechists from the Japanese Orthodox Church already working here, and some other faithful had requested a priest to come. So from that time, we have had Orthodoxy here in Taiwan. Actually, even earlier, because in 1896, the first Orthodox Christmas was celebrated here. This year, we celebrated the 125th anniversary of the first Christmas in Taiwan. Well, today's video is not about history; it's more about the current situation.

In recent times, the church mission here was revived, and the parish of the Russian Orthodox Church was re-established in 2012. That was about nine years ago. At that time, the Patriarch of Moscow blessed the opening of the parish, and this blessing was also given in Tokyo because there was a celebration of the 100th anniversary of Saint Nicholas. So, Saint Nicholas of Japan also participated in the revival of the mission here. At that time, the parish in Taipei was re-established, and communities in other places like Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hsinchu were formed. Just this year, we also formed a community in Hualien, which is on the east coast of Taiwan. So now, we have five communities all over Taiwan. Some of them are larger, and some are smaller, but there are five places where we can invite people to learn more about the faith and to become Orthodox, which is the main task of a missionary.

The development of the mission has been as follows: our primary task was to create stronger Orthodox communities. There were already Orthodox people here in Taiwan at that time, and it is important to have these communities because learning about faith involves participating in community life. It's not just about someone sharing their faith with another person.

This is good, but it's not enough. It's important that a person becomes part of the church in a community. So the communities were mainly Russian-speaking, but we also had English speakers, Americans, and people from different countries such as Serbia, Georgia, Greece, and, of course, Russian-speaking countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other places. However, the challenge was to ensure that it wasn’t just a foreigner community—it had to be open to the Taiwanese, to the locals, so that they could feel at home in this community. This was also a challenge. At that time, we introduced the faith everywhere. We began by reaching out to both the already Orthodox but non-churchgoing members of the Russian community and by participating in all kinds of community events so that everyone could learn about the faith. There are over 1,000 Russian speakers in Taiwan, mainly Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, and it is important to have this church community for them here as well. But this task was similar to that of other parishes in other countries under the Russian Orthodox Church. So the parish here in Taiwan had to embrace people from everywhere, and very importantly, the local Taiwanese people. At the time, there were already a few, though not many, Orthodox Taiwanese, and they also came to the church and participated in church life. We had to create classes for children, and we also offered English classes for the Taiwanese.

The main missionary efforts were guided by this principle: one missionary said that if nobody loves you, you just need to be in a place where people can see you. Sometimes, you just need to be present for the mission to exist and to thrive. This was one of the reasons why we established small communities in almost every major city in Taiwan. Another very important rule of the mission is that there must be a living connection with God. Prayer is of utmost importance for the mission. It’s not just about promoting a brand or spreading a philosophy, a teaching, or inviting people to join a club. There must be a close relationship, a direct link with God. Prayer is absolutely essential for the church mission. If there is a blessing from God, people will come and join because they feel that connection, that unity. So, it was a great effort—not just to pray, but also to translate or revise the translation of the liturgy and other prayers into Chinese, the local language here. We’ve spent considerable time on this, and we still have ongoing projects for translating the Gospels, other texts, and prayers. This is a very important task for the mission.

In terms of introducing the faith and reaching out, we’ve tried many methods. One approach was street missions, where we set up stands in big night markets. We had icons, a movie introducing the faith, and brochures inviting people to the church. Of course, we didn’t approach everyone; we waited for people to come to us, and then we would talk to them.

And only after that would we give them a brochure, ensuring it wasn’t overly persuasive. In those places, thousands of people passed by every hour, and perhaps only three or four would come to our stand to talk, ask questions, or receive materials. These were the people we invited, and some of them eventually came to church. Overall, this approach wasn’t very effective. It was very tiresome, but we could have done more if we had more resources, more manpower, and more missionaries. A lot of what can be accomplished in a mission depends on the people involved—not on funds or money, but on the individuals who are eager to introduce, share, and testify about their faith. Their talents also determine what kind of mission work can be done. We’ve seen this in other places like the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and East Timor, where missionaries from the Taiwan parish have gone to develop missions. The goal is to support each other, so that there will be more Orthodox Christians in the Asia-Pacific region and Southeast Asia who can help and strengthen one another, enabling us to do more together. This was also one of the tasks of the mission here in Taiwan, and it has worked with the help of God.

In addition to street missions, we’ve also conducted missions in universities, as some people are studying religion or learning the Russian language. In some places, we introduced the Orthodox faith, while in others, we focused on Russian or Byzantine culture, which is deeply intertwined with Orthodox faith. People learning about Russian language or culture are often willing to explore the faith of the Russian people, which can lead them to discover the truth of the Orthodox Christian faith. Of course, it’s important to make a clear distinction: this is not just the faith of Russians. While Russians embraced this faith, it is universal and open to everyone. We also invite other groups to visit the parish, including Catholic students from Furen University’s theology or religious studies departments, as well as parishioners from Catholic parishes, to come and discover the Orthodox faith. Our task is simply to plant the seed, and it’s up to the Lord to decide whether it will grow. If people come and choose to become Orthodox, it’s not because we’ve persuaded them, but because the Lord is working in their hearts. This is one of the key principles of our mission.

We are also actively developing an internet mission, which is very important. For example, these YouTube videos are part of that effort. We’ve had Taiwanese individuals who developed missions on social networks like Facebook and in local Taiwanese and Chinese-speaking online communities. This approach has also been effective, though we’re not currently doing much in this area. However, we could expand this work if we had more people willing to contribute, especially those fluent in Chinese or Taiwanese.

Another aspect of our mission is offering regular classes for Taiwanese individuals. Every week or every other week, we hold classes so that anyone interested in the faith can come, listen, ask questions, and engage in live discussions—not just rely on books or internet searches. We invite not only Catholics who are considering becoming Orthodox but also “listeners”—people who simply want to learn more about the faith without making any commitments yet. This provides an open door for people to explore the church at their own pace.

We also have cooperation with other places like Hong Kong and Moscow, where people are working to introduce the Orthodox faith in Chinese. We collaborate with the United States as well, inviting missionaries to come to Taiwan for practice and training. In the past, we’ve had many seminarians from the Moscow Theological Seminary come here, and the number of people interested in mission work toward Taiwanese and Chinese speakers, using the Chinese language, is growing. This growth is essential so that we can expand our mission capabilities in the future.

This is what we are doing now, and for the future, we hope to one day build a church in Taipei and establish a mission center. This center would offer training programs for missionaries from abroad and for Taiwanese individuals to become catechists, to catechize, and, in the future, to become priests. We hope this vision can become a reality one day. Additionally, we need to strengthen the community, deepen the faith, and encourage more people to pray and actively participate in church projects. We also aim to do more translation work so that more materials are available. Hopefully, we can also gain access to the Chinese mainland internet at some point to introduce the faith there and foster greater development in the region overall.

We should avoid a limited, localized mindset. Instead, we need to think broadly. For example, our catechism classes are conducted via Zoom, allowing people from all around the world to participate and listen. This is part of our broader mission. The most important thing, of course, is that our faith remains alive, strong, and burning. It’s not just about existing, knowing things, or giving lectures—it’s about having a living relationship with Christ and offering a powerful testimony of God’s Word to everyone, inspired by His blessing. This spiritual content, this spiritual element of the mission, is of utmost importance. We are here to conquer evil, to overthrow demons, and to bring Christ into the homes, hearts, and families of the local Taiwanese people, so that they may be resurrected in Christ with His help, grace, and blessing.

You are also welcome to participate in any of our projects. Please ask questions, learn more, and discover more together. May God bless every one of you. Amen.
