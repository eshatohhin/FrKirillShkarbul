# Has God abandoned this world

Dear brothers and sisters, we have entered into the week of the veneration of the Cross. This marks the midpoint of Great Lent, where we draw strength from the life-giving Cross to continue our journey to Golgotha with our Lord, to endure His Passion, and to achieve victory over death through death. During this time, we reflect on the meaning of the Cross, and I will dedicate my next video to this profound topic.

In this video, I aim to provide an introduction to this theme by connecting it to current global events. How should we, as Christians, face and understand what is happening in the world? Many are asking: Does the Lord have control over these events? Should we remain calm, trusting that everything is part of God's plan? Or should we take action, rather than waiting for divine intervention, as everything seems to be falling apart? We face wars, pandemics, economic crises, ecological disasters—everything appears to be crumbling. Where is God in all of this?

The answer lies in the Cross. To understand this, we turn to the story of Job, a righteous man who endured suffering despite his righteousness. In this way, Job prefigures Christ, who was also righteous yet suffered. This was perplexing to the ancient Israelites, who believed that righteousness brought blessings and prosperity, while sin led to suffering and death. Job's suffering raised questions about God's justice. He wondered if some flaw or "bug" had corrupted God's plan, leading to his suffering.

However, God's response to Job was not a direct answer. Instead, God revealed His creation—how animals give birth, how the world is filled with His wisdom, care, and purpose. Through this, Job realized that God's wisdom surpasses human understanding. He acknowledged God's omnipotence and accepted that he did not need to question every detail of God's plan. This is a valuable lesson for us: we do not need to constantly seek answers or question whether events align with God's plan. His wisdom far exceeds our comprehension.

That said, we must distinguish between two types of suffering. First, there is the suffering of the righteous, which aligns with God's providence and wisdom. Though God does not desire suffering, it serves a greater purpose, yielding fruitful outcomes. For example, Christ's death brought salvation, and Job's suffering provided profound lessons and prophecies. Second, there is the suffering of unrepentant sinners and evildoers. Their suffering and death are not part of God's plan; He does not will their sin or suffering. Their fate is a consequence of their actions, not God's design.

In summary, the Cross teaches us to trust in God's wisdom, even when we cannot fully understand His plan. The suffering of the righteous serves a greater purpose, while the suffering of the unrepentant is a result of their choices. Let us reflect on this as we continue our Lenten journey.

God did not create the people of Sodom and Gomorrah with the purpose of destroying them one day. Their destruction was not His intent in creating them. The Lord hates lawlessness; everything that opposes His commandments and His love is an abomination before Him. Such actions are not good, and while the Lord has control over all things, He does not guide or condone what is against His will. These acts are simply contrary to Him—they are evil.

To address these questions, we must distinguish between two realities. First, let us consider our present time. Today, we see widespread suffering across the world. However, not everyone is suffering. Some sinners, in fact, thrive amidst the chaos, profiting from the turmoil. Not all who sin are suffering at this moment. This raises further questions, but for now, let us focus on the broader picture.

In our time, we are blessed with modern saints who have explained what it truly means to follow Christ. Simply reading the Bible is not enough for most of us to grasp its depth, as evidenced by the myriad sects and factions, each with their own interpretations of Scripture. It is easy to go astray. However, these holy men and women, who achieved profound union with the Lord, have provided invaluable guidance. They have illuminated the path for us.

At the same time, we also see the influence of false prophets—those who embody the "spirit of Antichrist." This spirit has been with humanity since ancient times, inspiring many who are enslaved by sin, thirst for power, or are driven by satanic pride. These individuals, consumed by their passions, become ministers or even prophets of this spirit. One such figure is the philosopher Nietzsche, whom Hitler greatly admired. Nietzsche's ideas inspired many in the 20th century and continue to influence people today. While Hitler is gone, the spirit of Antichrist remains, manifesting in various forms and expressions.

Nietzsche was candid in describing the principles of this spirit. He spoke of Dionysus, the chaotic and unrestrained force that lies beneath the surface of culture—a force that aligns with what we call the "old man" within us. This "old man" represents the sinful, beastly nature that craves satisfaction through sin and chaos, often overwhelming us. Nietzsche also famously declared, "God is dead, and we have killed Him." This statement reflects the spiritual condition of Western society in the 19th century and, even more so, in our postmodern world today. Many no longer believe in God; instead, they place their faith in progress, social contracts, corporate power, or vague notions of a "bright future." They may believe in good or evil, but they do not believe that the Lord can intervene or transform this world.

This practical disbelief in God is the spirit of Antichrist in our time. Even those who call themselves Christians may only cling to a shadow of faith—traditions or the Bible—without truly allowing God into their hearts. If we do not want Him, if we do not trust Him, He will not force His presence upon us. This rejection has led to the liberation of masses onto a broad path—a path that leads to destruction, serving Mammon and the Antichrist. This liberation has already occurred, and we are now witnessing its fruits. We are, in many ways, the children of this spirit.

In summary, while God does not will the destruction of sinners, He abhors lawlessness and evil. We must discern between the suffering of the righteous, which serves a greater purpose, and the destructive consequences of sin. In our time, the spirit of Antichrist manifests through disbelief and the rejection of God, leading many astray. Let us heed the wisdom of the saints and remain vigilant, trusting in the Lord's ultimate plan and rejecting the chaos of the "old man" within us.

For our generation, we are the children—or perhaps grandchildren—of the spirit of Antichrist, a spirit that believes in anything but God. We place our faith in money, progress, power, or whatever else the world offers, but not in God. We may convince ourselves, "I am a Christian, I believe in Christ, I read the Bible," but this surface-level faith is not enough. In our actions and how we navigate life, we often live as Antichristians. I, too, am guilty of this. Most of us are, though we fail to perceive it because we do not know how to be different. It is easy to conform to the world, to make choices based on our desires, passions, and worldly values rather than on the commandments of the Lord. In doing so, we serve Mammon and the Antichrist, even if unintentionally.

I have spoken about this before. If the world is lawless, consumed by sin and unrepentance, then the suffering we see is not the suffering of the righteous but of unrepentant sinners. This is fundamentally different from the suffering of Job, which was allowed by God for a greater purpose. While the righteous—those few who remain faithful to the Lord and live by His commandments—will also suffer, their suffering, like Job's, serves a divine purpose. However, the suffering of the world at large is more akin to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, destined for destruction. We must make this distinction and not conflate the two.

We must also confront and mortify the "Dionysian" spirit within us—the chaotic, sinful nature that craves destruction and self-gratification. This is the "old man" we must put to death. The way of life promoted by the spirit of Antichrist appears powerful and convincing. We build vast systems—capitalism, communism, and other ideologies—that dominate our world. Yet, this apparent strength is an illusion. The persecution of the Church, the destruction wrought by sin, and the chaos of our age do not stem from true power but from weakness. When someone lashes out in anger, destroys things, or screams in frustration, it is not a sign of strength but of profound weakness. The same is true of the systems and ideologies that oppose God. Their destruction is born of impotence, not power.

Nietzsche's philosophy, which glorifies the "superman" and rejects God, is a lie rooted in hatred. He misunderstood Christianity, conflating it with the failings of certain institutions, and his rejection of Christ led him to promote a perverted vision of humanity. The "superman" he envisioned is not a true man but a miserable, broken being—a destruction of human nature. This is the same spirit driving modern movements like transhumanism, which seek to replace the divine image in humanity with something artificial and degraded.

True power does not come from destruction or the pursuit of worldly dominance. It comes from the Cross. The Cross gives us the strength to overcome our passions, resist temptations, and face persecution and evil with courage. This is real power—the power to live as God intended, to rise above the chaos of the "old man" within us, and to embrace the divine nature we are called to share in. The so-called "superman" Nietzsche preached is a pitiful figure, enslaved by his own weaknesses and blinded by arrogance. In contrast, the true power of the Cross sets us free, transforming us into the image of Christ, the perfect Man. Let us reject the lies of the spirit of Antichrist and embrace the life-giving power of the Cross.

Let us be wise and seek a deeper understanding of the Spirit of Christ, following the narrow path to salvation. Even as the world around us descends into chaos and confusion, let us hold fast to the Spirit of Christ within us. No matter what trials we face—war, persecution, or any form of suffering—we can trust that these experiences are woven into the Lord's greater plan of salvation, both for us and for the world. The Church, as the body of Christ, stands as the central axis of world history, and our faithfulness to the Lord plays a crucial role in His divine plan.

In the face of widespread apostasy and moral decline, let us remain loyal and steadfast in our faith. Let us cultivate peace in our hearts, drawing closer to the Lord and growing stronger in Him as we walk the path to Golgotha and, ultimately, to salvation. The Lord will grant us joy and blessings as we remain faithful to Him. May His grace sustain us, and may we find strength in His presence, no matter the challenges we encounter. Amen.
