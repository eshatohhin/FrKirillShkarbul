# Formalism makes prayer useless

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am again in Taizhou. We just had the Divine Service here, and we spoke with our faithful Taiwanese brothers and sisters. In this great land, four Taiwanese faithful catechumens will be baptized. This is a very positive development here in Taizhou.

Today, during these holy days of the land, I want to speak about prayer, as we are encouraged to pray more during these days to draw closer to God. Consider King Jehoshaphat, who placed his faith before the Lord. When he heard that an army was approaching to destroy them, he turned to the Lord. He proclaimed that everyone must fast, and he prayed earnestly from his heart to the Lord. Similarly, now is the time for us to set our faith before the Lord, to turn away from all distractions, and to focus on speaking with Him through prayer and fasting. Fasting intensifies our prayer, demonstrating, "Lord, see, I am even suffering for You, for Your name's sake. I want You to hear me."

During this time, I want to share with everyone the risk of formalism in our relationship with God. This is a problem of our time. Even in our interactions with others, we often use very formal language. Our day-to-day conversations are filled with bureaucratic phrases. For example, instead of simply saying, "Should I tell you that this might happen?" we use convoluted structures. Our language, especially with people we are not close to, becomes laden with formality—dead language that feels like a burden. We might mistake this for high culture, but it is not. It is merely an imitation of culture, like a monkey mimicking God. The devil mimics God, too. What appears sophisticated and high-class is, in fact, fake—a surrogate for something real.

We bring this formalism into the church and into our relationship with God. We see this problem in the Old Testament as well. The priests accumulated many rituals and traditions. The issue is that the church goes through various situations. In the Old Testament, the church had a rich experience of life with God. We have the Psalms of David, the writings of the prophets, prayers for many occasions, and the traditions of holy people. Over time, these became incredibly valuable and precious. However, newcomers often struggle to understand their purpose. Abraham, for example, was able to pray to God without a temple, rituals, or sacrifices. Yet, over time, the priests became so preoccupied with temple duties that they neglected the wounded man lying on the road. Only the good Samaritan showed mercy. Similarly, in our pursuit of accumulating prayers, liturgies, teachings, theology, and traditions, we risk losing sight of the poor and the most important commandments of God.

This is the risk I want to address. Some people come to the church and say, "I hear so many prayers, but they all feel jammed together and quite formal." This is indeed something we need to work on. There is a temptation to add more prayers, thinking that quantity equals depth. For instance, a monk might spend hours reading prayers from the heart in a monastery, but when someone tries to replicate this in parish life in the city, they cram it all into an hour and a half, rushing through the prayers according to the rules. This approach risks losing the essence of prayer and connection with God.

Let us strive to avoid formalism and focus on genuine, heartfelt communication with God, remembering the simplicity and sincerity of faith exemplified by figures like Abraham and the good Samaritan.

We are supposed to read prayers, finish them, and feel satisfied: "Okay, I finished everything I was supposed to read. I can go home now." But is this truly what God wants from us? Let us imagine a relationship—perhaps with a spouse, a family member, or a close friend—where communication becomes a fixed routine. For example, you come home from work and say, "Hello, how are you? Have you eaten? How are the children? I miss you. I love you. See you tomorrow." These are all things we are supposed to say, but over time, they can become a formal ritual, a mere protocol. We go through the motions, say the expected words, and then move on. 

Sometimes, in the church, we see a similar pattern. We read prayers while our minds are elsewhere—perhaps cleaning or doing other tasks. Imagine if human relationships were like that. Wouldn’t you want to run away from such a relationship? It would feel hollow, like a surrogate for genuine connection. There would be no joy, no real communication—just robotic repetition of what we are "supposed" to say. The same can happen in our prayers to the Lord. 

This is why the Lord’s Prayer calls us to settle our hearts, to pray sincerely from within, expressing what we truly want to say to God and listening for His response. This issue is also tied to despondency. What is despondency? It is the deep-seated feeling that the Lord will not hear us, that there is no point in speaking to Him. So, we say what we are "supposed" to say, check it off the list, and leave. It becomes a formality: "Here, You want me to say this? I’ll say it and go." But if we are honest with ourselves, we all struggle with this. We often hesitate to open our hearts fully to the Lord and speak to Him sincerely. 

This is a significant problem, whether we are praying alone at home or with our brothers and sisters in church. There is always the risk of falling into formalism. Even our language in addressing those above us—whether in the church or in daily life—can become overly bureaucratic and formalized. For example, in the church, we might hear prayers like, "Let us pray for our great Lord and Father, His Holiness, the Most Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Kirill, and for our great Lord and Most Holy Father, His High Eminence, Blessed Macarius." We use all these titles and formalities. The same applies to the saints: "Let us pray to the great prince and equal-to-the-apostles, the prince of all Bulgaria, Boris." These titles are meant to show reverence, but they can become excessive and overloaded. 

This problem is not new. It existed in Byzantium, where titles and formalities grew excessively. It also occurred in Rome, where the papal primacy became overly inflated. Both Byzantium and Rome faced crises as a result—Byzantium fell to the Turks, and Rome experienced its own struggles. Russia, too, faced similar risks and suffered consequences. We must learn from these historical lessons. Formalism in our relationship with God can lead to crises, not only for the church but for entire nations and peoples. 

If we want a genuine, healthy relationship with God, it is not enough to be formally Orthodox—to have a baptismal certificate and go through the motions. We must have a living, active communication with the Lord. We must stand firm in our faith, speak to Him daily, trust Him with our requests, and learn to open our hearts and listen to His voice. 

Another problem arises when our language becomes overly bureaucratic and formal, even in daily life. This creates distance and hinders genuine connection. Let us strive to break free from such formalism, both in our relationships with others and in our relationship with God. Let our prayers and our words come from the heart, reflecting a sincere desire to connect and communicate. Only then can we experience the joy and depth of a true relationship with the Lord.

But when formality fades, and we become more comfortable in a relationship—especially when someone depends on us rather than us depending on them—the dynamic changes entirely. We might drop formalities and say things like, "Hey, you, what's up?" We might think this is honest and genuine, but often it is not. It can be vulgar, barbaric, and impolite. We mistake it for honesty, but it is often a lack of respect—rudeness. It reveals a kind of inner savagery. We start speaking to people in this manner, thinking it signifies friendship or closeness, as if to say, "We're like brothers, bro, remember?" 

This same attitude can creep into our relationship with God. Some might adopt a casual approach, saying, "Oh, He's our bro," as if God is just a friend to be taken lightly. This lack of respect and fear leads to losing sight of who God truly is. He does not tolerate such irreverence. In our relationships with people, we face this risk of crossing the line from familiarity to disrespect. With God, the risk is even greater. We must maintain both fear and reverence toward Him, but this must come from the heart, not from rigid formalities or a checklist of what we are "supposed" to say or do.

May the Lord grant us wisdom to pray sincerely, to open our hearts, and to overcome despondency and all forms of artificial, formalistic approaches to our relationship with Him. There is nothing artificial in the Lord. He is the truth, and He desires our hearts to be true, open, and straightforward before Him. The word "orthodox" comes from "orthos," meaning straight. We are called to have our hearts straight before the Lord, to hold true faith, and to be genuinely loyal to Him. This is the example set by the prophets, righteous kings, and martyrs from the Old Testament to the New Church era. Countless people were willing to die because their hearts were straight and their faith was true. There was no deceit, no games, no playing with the living God.

Amen. May the Lord give us such a heart, strengthen our faith, and teach us to love Him with our whole being. Amen. May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you, bringing peace to the land and spiritual growth to its people. Amen.
