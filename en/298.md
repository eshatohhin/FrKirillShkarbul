# Lent： Freedom in Desert vs. All-Inclusive in Egypt

Dear brothers and sisters, the first week of the Great Lent is about to end. This Sunday is called the Triumph of Orthodoxy. Today, I want to speak about this journey of Lent that brings us back to those 40 years of wandering in the desert.

When the Israelites left Egypt, which was quite comfortable—even though it was slavery, they had food, work, and shelter; it was very stable—they lost all of this and did not gain the promised land. They saw how beautiful it was but were unable to enter. 

Now, they are in these 40 years of wandering, seemingly hopeless. This was a very important school and also a very important prophecy about what the Church will be like. The Church does not have any earthly kingdom. The Church has only this promised land, which is in the heavens. In this world, we are going through this path of wandering, learning how to listen to the Lord, how to follow Him, and how not to put our trust in this world. Someone in the desert is not trying to build a house; they are trying to see where to go.

The Great Lent is six weeks minus two days, exactly 40 days. Then, we will have the Passion Week, another week of serious fasting, but it is not part of the Great Lent. We do not call it Holy Week; that is a Catholic way of saying it. It is the Passion Week.

During these 40 days, we have the chance to regain our calling and our dignity as Christians. We are Christians not because we are baptized but because we belong to Christ, because our homeland and our citizenship are in the heavens, and because we take up our cross and follow Christ. We do not look around; we do not find refuge in this earthly life. Saint Basil the Great said that whoever is in comfort does not have a contrite heart.

Any kind of comfort we have or dream about is against the kingdom of heaven. It is against Christ. It is directed toward crucifying Christ. Now is the time to cut away every dependence on this world, and this begins with fasting—fasting from food.

During these days, many so-called Orthodox Christians do not care at all about fasting, which means they are not Orthodox Christians. Today, I will not talk about them. Whoever does not fast during the Great Lent is not a member of the Church. This is according to the Holy Canons. There are different ways of fasting—strict or less strict—but if you do not fast, if you decide, "Well, it's not for me; I will just pray, I will just do something else, but no fasting," then, sorry, you are not Orthodox; you are not Christian. Of course, Protestants are not Christians because they do not have any fasting. They are just in the class of the devil. Catholics are there also, for that matter. But most Orthodox also misunderstand this.

Among Christians who are trying to fast, who are trying to be good Orthodox Christians, there are two ways of looking at it. One way is liberal, pseudo-spiritual, which says, "Well, we are already spiritual, so why do we need to talk about food? I eat sausage, I eat carrots—what does it matter?" This is just a way of finding an excuse for the flesh. Whoever neglects fasting in terms of food is basically just a slave of the flesh, working for the old man within themselves, trying to worship their belly and find an excuse to persuade themselves that they are Christian. But there is nothing in common between them and Christianity.

Another way of looking at it is a conservative way, but it is the way of a Pharisee. Unfortunately, many Christians, even faithful ones, think that the more serious they are about the rules of fasting, the more Orthodox they are, the more traditional they are. And where does this lead them? To a canine religion, as I discussed in a previous video.

What is a canine religion? It is the mindset of, "This is for God, and this is for me. God, you want these rules? I follow these rules. Be happy, give me your blessing, and everything else I keep for myself." This is a significant problem. No matter how strict your fasting is, if your basic attitude is like this, sorry, you are a Pharisee, you are a "canine." You are not truly Orthodox or conservative—do not fool yourself.

For the Orthodox, the cure, as Saint Basil the Great tells us, is repentance. Repentance without fasting is empty; it is not true repentance. We need fasting for repentance, and the Lord is looking for our hearts. If we want to recover our dignity and our essence as Christians, our calling, if we want to be faithful to our calling, we need to love God from the depths of our being, like Abel. 

Abel's sacrifice was from the heart, from the innermost parts of the animals. He brought those parts as a sacrifice to symbolize that his whole self was offered to God. Unless this is our aim during Lent, this Lent will be for nothing. What does this mean practically? Practically, it means that we are not satisfied with ourselves. 

Practically, it means that we see ourselves as being cast out of the bridal chamber. We are full of sorrow, standing and weeping, knocking so that the Lord may open the doors of His mercy to us. I can share with you my experience with the Great Lent. 

For many years, I aimed to be very serious and strict about Lent. There are not many people like that, but I discovered that this approach is also wrong. I was trying to be very serious, researching how the early Christians fasted—they would not eat for the entire day and perhaps have just a little something in the evening, and so on.

and I tried to follow their example, at least on some of the stricter days. But by the end of the first week, I failed every time. Every Lent was a failure, and I couldn’t understand why this was happening. After many trials, I realized that the core problem was my self-reliance. I relied on myself, though I wasn’t conscious of it. I thought I was humble, but the reality proved otherwise. The reality showed that I believed I could do it on my own, and if I succeeded, I gave myself bonus points—"Yes, I’ve done it. I’m good." This is what the Lord hates. He hates when we think like that, and He does not grant us success in Lent as long as we have this attitude. Even if we are not conscious of it, the Lord sees it. 

So, if we want to be successful in Lent, if we want to recover our status as Christians, we need to empty ourselves. We need to break our pride. We need to acknowledge that we are nothing—that without the Lord, we are nothing. We fail and spoil everything. Only in that state of humility will the Lord give us joy—the joy of being free, free from the shackles of this world, like the people in the desert. We must learn to be free from all these worldly bonds that imprison us. Try to be happy about not having any refuge in this world—not in your house, not in your property, not in your relatives, not in your career, not in your diplomas, not in your savings—nothing. All of that is nothing. I can throw it all away at any time because my heart belongs to the Lord. That is what matters to me. Whatever He tells me to do, wherever He tells me to go, I will do it. I will go without reservation, without second thought. This is what the Lord expects from us—to regain this during the Great Lent. We have this great opportunity now, but it will be lost if we do not seize it. Once Lent is over, it’s back to normal life. So now, during Lent, this is the time. This is the great opportunity, and we have everything necessary for it. 

Restricting ourselves in terms of food opens the path to salvation. For Eve, her failure to restrain herself opened the way to death. She chose to be fed by something other than God, and that choice is before us now. We choose either to live for food, for some tasty thing—be it entertainment, career, or whatever—or to be fed by God. He said, "I am the bread of life," meaning He alone is the true food for us. If we choose something else, we reject Him. During Lent, we begin by constraining ourselves in terms of food, and this helps us learn what it means to constrain ourselves from other things. This constraint creates emptiness. Your passions will be hungry, which is why some people become nervous or easily irritated. But that emptiness, that vacuum created by restricting our exposure to social media, communication, events, or whatever else, is an opportunity. It is time to use prayer to fill that emptiness with God. Otherwise, He will not come. There is no place for Him if you are filled with all kinds of things—your mind, your heart, your belly—everything is full. We need to make ourselves empty so that He can come and find a place in us. And you will see how sweet it is to receive God into yourself.

This will bring us back to our homeland, our spiritual homeland, which is our union with Christ. We can continue this for the rest of the year. Now, we are not dreaming about how Lent will end, with a nice trapeza or a celebratory meal on Pascha and afterward. We do not think about such things at all. We do not think about tasty food or similar distractions—it is over. Instead, we think about the celebration in the kingdom of heaven with our Lord. Whatever we gain in terms of losing ourselves—losing our worldly attachments to gain true life—we want to preserve even after Lent. May the Lord help us, give us eager hearts, and make us conscious of the apocalypse. 

A true Christian is one who lives in the apocalypse. What does this mean? It means that every prayer, every act of fasting, is an invitation for the second coming of Christ. The Lord’s Prayer—"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"—is a call for the Lord to come in His second coming, for the final judgment. We are calling for this world to end. We are living in this apocalypse every day. What earthly matters or concerns would matter to you if you are craving the apocalypse? It is opening up for us every day, brothers and sisters. This is the reality we need to enter into—this kind of life. Now is the time to enter into this reality. That will be true Christianity. That will be bearing the cross of Christ. That will be not worrying about tomorrow, as the Lord has said. 

May the Lord give us such hearts. May He help us find refuge in Him alone, crave for Him alone, and throw away anything that binds us, anything that makes us addicted to the corrupt and perishable things of this world. Food and everything else belonging to this world will perish; they do not have life in them. Only God will not perish. He is the true food we desire, the true food we crave, the true food we hunger for. May the Lord give us this food and keep us as true members of His precious body. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
