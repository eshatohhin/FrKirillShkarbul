# The first dreamer is devil - why dreams lead us away from Christ

Dear brothers and sisters, tomorrow the Holy Church celebrates the feast of the great apostles Peter and Paul.  
They provide us with the brightest example of what it means to be an apostle, to follow Christ, and to be His witness.  
We have been fasting for over three weeks to prepare for this celebration—not just for the celebration itself, but for the mission we are all called to participate in.  
"You will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth," as it was said after Pentecost.  
Soon after Pentecost, we began to prepare.  
The Holy Church received the Holy Spirit and is now sent into the world to preach the Gospel and bear witness to the truth and love of Jesus Christ.  

Today, I want to talk about why most people—even Christians, and even Orthodox Christians—do not follow this path.  
This sometimes escapes our attention and understanding.  
The notion of a dream—having some kind of dream—is familiar to us.  
We know about the American Dream, the dream of space exploration, of going to the moon.  
In Soviet times, there was the dream of a bright, happy future under communism—a dream people aspired to.  
Now, people talk about inclusive, sustainable growth and development—a world without wars, inequality, or ecological problems, where all issues are resolved.  
This is another dream being presented to us.  

We must remember that the first dreamer, so to speak, was the devil.  
He did not want to follow the Lord and said, "God is almighty, the ruler and king of the universe. But I am also powerful, I am smart, and I want to be the king of the universe. I want to control this world."  
He is, in fact, called the prince of this world.  
He uses deceit, passions, perversion, and all manner of means to control and subdue the world, to make people instruments of his will.  
This is how the kingdom of the antichrist will come about—through these dreams.  

What kind of dreams? We have individual dreams.  
And we can see that much of the pain, suffering, and strife in the world comes from dreams that have not been realized.  
For example, from early childhood, you might dream of becoming an engineer, a soldier, a scientist, or something else.  
But then it doesn’t happen. You spend years studying, but it doesn’t come to pass.  
Instead, you become, say, a taxi driver or something else entirely.  
You don’t achieve what you dreamed of, and you carry that resentment throughout your life.  

Or consider those who dream of a happy marriage, imagining a life filled with joy and harmony.  
But later, they find it to be mundane, filled with problems and quarrels.  
They, too, become disillusioned with life.  

We see this frustration amplified during the pandemic.  
Many businesses failed, and people lost their livelihoods, their dreams shattered.  
They had envisioned a certain future, but it was suddenly destroyed.  
This has led to problems with drugs, alcohol, suicide, and other issues.  
Depression is rampant—everyone seems to be lonely, fearful, or anxious about the future.  
Philosophers call this resentment, and it is the root of many problems.  

The devil exploits this. First, he gives you a dream, and you become excited by it.  
Then, when it fails, he plunges you into despair and controls you through that despair.  
Sometimes, he even tries to destroy you through that despair.  
Or he channels your anger toward others, inciting conflict and war.  
People are told, "All your problems are because of those people," and they go to fight against them.  
This is how conflicts arise, like the one we see today.  
You know what I’m referring to.  
Both sides are brainwashed, and people are eager to find someone to blame for their problems.

Or in the past, it was said, "These anti-vaxxers are guilty of people getting sick and dying. Let's punish them, let's take action."  
In the past, Hitler claimed, "It's all because of the Jews and the Gypsies. Let's kill them all."  
Or the communists said, "Let's destroy them."  
All of this hatred stems from some kind of unfulfilled dream, and now someone must be blamed for it.  
People don’t want to blame themselves.  
They are too proud, thinking, "No, it must be someone else’s fault that my life is miserable."  

Now, they say, "All governments are to blame. You’re so poor, you have all these problems—it’s because of bad governance.  
Let’s get rid of all governments and have one world system.  
You don’t need these corrupt governments.  
We have AI that will decide everything for you."  
And people will buy into that.  

The same dynamic splits the Church.  
Take the Pope of Rome, for example.  
For a thousand years, he was an Orthodox bishop.  
But then he had a dream: "I must rule the whole universe."  
This is the dream of Satan.  
Those who didn’t agree with him were labeled schismatics.  
As a result, he was cut off from the Church and became a Catholic—a heretic.  

Then came the reformers, like Martin Luther and others, who dreamed, "We will restore the original Church, the original Christianity."  
But they lacked piety and prayer, and though they knew of Orthodoxy, they wanted their own way.  
Each of them created their own sect, leading to further division.  
None of this bears good fruit because it stems from satanic motivation.  

But you might say, "If I don’t have a dream, I’ll have no meaning in life. I’ll be lazy and do nothing."  
No. Today’s feast reminds us of the truth.  
If we are willing to follow Christ and take up our cross, as He said, "Take up your cross and follow Me," we find true purpose.  
These words were originally spoken by an executioner to a prisoner about to be executed: "Take up your cross and follow me, because I’m going to kill you."  
The prisoner would follow for the last few minutes of his life, no longer concerned with worldly matters—his connections, property, or earthly dreams.  

This is why the Lord uses these words.  
If someone follows Jesus, they will not cling to dreams of this life—whether it’s a nice car, a perfect body, or anything else.  
As soon as you have a dream in this life, it will lead you into delusion.  
You will live in an illusory world, a spiritual metaverse, and eventually, a real metaverse.  
This is the path humanity is heading toward, slipping into the hands of the Antichrist.  
We must be ready for this.  

Many people dream of financial freedom, thinking, "I can buy anything I want anytime."  
But if you have that dream, there is no place for God in your life.  
We have the dreams of liberals and conservatives, who fight each other.  
We have the dreams of immigrants who abandon everything, thinking they will find paradise in another country—only to find misery instead.  

I’m not saying no one achieves their dreams. Some do.  
But when they do, they often find they have no room for God, no room for Christ.  
You cannot serve both mammon and God.  

Where does all this come from?  
It comes from the memory of lost paradise—the paradise Adam and Eve lost.  
Everyone carries this memory, this longing for what was lost.  
But instead of seeking God, we chase dreams that lead us further away from Him.

And we have dreams like, "Oh, I’m going to have that nice property, that bungalow, and that will be my dream life."  
That’s your longing for the lost paradise, but don’t think you’ll find it in this life.  
True paradise will be in the next life, with the Lord, with Jesus Christ.  

Some people dream, "I’ll invest in real estate, and it will bring me income, and life will be so nice."  
But then they find themselves enslaved by those very things.  
We must be completely immune to the devil’s temptations, so he cannot seduce us with such dreams.  
Our only focus should be on our cross—how we can follow Jesus Christ today in our lives.  
This is what we must do every day. This is the focus of our lives, not some delusional dream.  

The arms race, the revolutions—they all came from people chasing dreams.  
Politicians promise, "You will have high pensions, laws, freedoms, and liberties."  
People cheer, "Ohhh!" But in the end, it amounts to nothing.  

Even the Antichrist will operate this way.  
He will promise all kinds of goodies:  
"You will have a minimum income, no wars, a happy life, no epidemics, good health, and long life.  
Just receive my mark so you can be connected to this system."  
And people will buy into it.  

But later, he will fail to fulfill those promises.  
The Lord will withhold the earth’s fruit, and there will be famine.  
People will come to him, demanding, "Where is the happy life you promised?"  
And he will say, "Oh, sorry, guys. Actually, you used force."  
By then, he will have all the power, and it will be very hard for those who oppose him.  

This is what’s coming.  
We must be immune to it and learn to follow Jesus Christ alone.  
We must not buy into any dream or delusion the devil offers.  

Let us be with the Lord.  
Let us dream only of Him and His kingdom.  
Let us be safe from all romanticism and fantasies.  
If we remain with Him, we will receive salvation and join Him in His feast in the kingdom of heaven.  

May the Lord grant you wisdom, strength, and love for Him and others.  
Amen. God bless.
