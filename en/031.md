# How not to lose time

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about time, a topic that leads us to the meaning of life and to the issue many face today: the loss of meaning in their lives because they do not understand the purpose of the days they live through. For some, these days are filled with activities, yet they feel that all of it is meaningless because it will eventually end. For others, the days are monotonous, as every day feels the same, perhaps because they have nothing to do, and their lives become miserable. 

As Christians, we also face certain risks. The first is that we may become too superficial. Many people fall into this trap, focusing solely on today's activities—what to do, where to go—without thinking about God or eternity. This is why many have chosen to become monks, spending their time in silence, not speaking, but instead settling down, looking into their hearts, talking to God, and listening for His response. This practice is crucial in monastic ascetic life, as it allows the seed of faith to grow in our hearts and brings us closer to eternity.

However, this brings us to another risk: overemphasizing eternity and the absolute, to the point of neglecting this life. We might start to see every day as fleeting and the material world as perishable, with no value. This can lead to the temptation of escaping from this world. But our Lord did not escape from this world. He came, ministered, and every day of His ministry was of great importance. This is how we should live as well. We must nurture the root of faith in our hearts, being rooted in eternity and the Word of God. When we do this, we can see the beauty of God and eternity in every moment of our lives and in everything around us. This is what the Lord wants us to learn—to view everything through the prism of eternity.

Now, let me give you some concrete examples. Often, we look at old photos of our relatives, perhaps from 10 or 20 years ago, and we notice how much they have changed. Life is constantly changing. Children grow up, older people age, and we see that life is transient, limited, and short. Every day, we hear news of someone passing away. When we meet people we haven't seen in a long time, we notice how they have changed. These are reminders that life is not simple. It's not just about where you go today or how time passes. We must value each day and draw as much spiritual nourishment as possible from the time that is passing.

We need to resist the way time makes us feel—that yesterday's history is unimportant and that only the present moment matters. This is especially true in the age of social media, where the focus is on what is happening now, what is new, and what is fresh. But this desire for something new actually originates from God. God is eternal, yet He is ever-changing. He is life itself, and life is always renewing itself. He never becomes boring. This desire for renewal is normal and good. 

Let us strive to see the eternal in the everyday, to value each moment, and to live our lives rooted in the Word of God, so that we may truly understand the purpose of our days and the beauty of eternity in all that surrounds us.

People are created in God's image. However, we are separated from God, and many of our characteristics, as well as the desires of our souls, have become distorted. As a result, we often focus only on what is new—what happened today—while disregarding what occurred three years ago, or even three days ago. Our history is cut off, and we lose sight of the bigger picture. We must learn to cultivate a willingness to see the whole picture, which includes both history and eternity. 

When we communicate with someone, such as a relative, we need to see the whole person—their past, present, and even their future potential. This perspective enriches our experience of them. Similarly, the places we inhabit, whether our homes or the towns we live in, carry their own histories. When we recall the experiences we’ve had in these places—perhaps meeting someone there or reliving a childhood memory—it deepens our appreciation and understanding of them. This adds another dimension to our perception, making our experiences fuller and spiritually richer. 

We need to recover this way of seeing because the modern world and lifestyle often strip away these layers of meaning. The modern world seeks to erase history and anything that transcends time, focusing only on constant change. But we are called to be different. If we fail to do so, our lives will become miserable, and our spiritual lives will be depleted. God calls us to have a rich experience of each day, where every day feels like many years because it is filled with spiritual and timeless experiences and knowledge. 

These examples remind us to value our lives and our days. We should treat each day as if it were our last, and we should truly value the people we meet, for everything is deeply valuable. Eternity touches every moment of existence. Let us learn from our Lord how to cultivate such a heart, how to perceive things in this way, and how to open our spiritual eyes. This is of utmost importance. The Lord will give us His wisdom and a deep, healthy heart that can engage with reality in the right way, so that we do not look back with regret, thinking, "Time was wasted. Five or ten years have passed, and nothing has changed or improved." Instead, let us live each day as if it were a poem, already complete and beautiful, not needing to be rewritten. 

May God help us and grant us such a mind and such a heart. Amen.
