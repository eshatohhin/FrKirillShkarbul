# “The Sons of Light” vs. “the Sons of this World”

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about what it means to be sons of light and how this is fundamentally different from any kind of enlightenment, awakening, or revelation preached by the secular or sectarian world.  
Because we live in an agnostic world, where mass culture revolves around mass education, mass media, and mass information, as though receiving some form of enlightenment.  
People often become prideful, believing they are enlightened, that they understand everything, that they know everything. This creates a false sense of knowing it all.  

This phenomenon occurs in stages. One significant stage was the Reformation, when individuals became the measure of truth—interpreting the Bible in their own way, believing that what is true for them is the ultimate truth. Then came modernity and all its accompanying ideologies.  
Yet, all of this is fundamentally different from true enlightenment. Today, I want to explain what true enlightenment means and how to distinguish it—how to discern where true light resides and where false light deceives.  

The Lord Himself said, "If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" Even 2,000 years ago, it was evident that there existed a form of demonic delusion, making people feel enlightened—like the scribes and Pharisees, learned men who were deeply entrenched in darkness. They did not receive Christ; they were unwilling to submit themselves or surrender their pride to the true light of Christ.  

The Apostle John emphasizes light. In the first chapter of his Gospel, we read that John the Baptist declared, "I am not the true light; the true light is coming." That true light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. This is mysterious language because, typically, light and darkness cannot coexist. If there is light, there is no darkness; if there is darkness, there is no light. Yet here, the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.  

This mysterious light shining in the darkness is the light of our Lord. The Apostle John, in John 12:36, tells us, "Believe in the light, that you may become sons of light." The first step to becoming children of light is to believe in Jesus Christ—that He is the Lord, the Savior—and to become His follower.  

Anything that deviates from this—whether Buddhism, Hinduism, New Age, secular enlightenment, Rousseau, the encyclopedists, Francis Bacon, or Masonic teachings—is darkness. It is all demonic delusion, for the devil himself can appear as an angel of light, as we read in the Bible.  

How, then, do we distinguish true light from false light? Let us proceed step by step.  

From ancient times, Christians prayed in darkness, during the night. While they prayed during the day as well, nighttime prayer held a special intensity. This prayer was divided into several stages. The first prayer occurred during twilight or right after dinner, around six o'clock. This practice evolved into what we now know as Vespers. During Vespers, a light is carried to the center of the church, symbolizing Christ. This light also represents each of us who have become lights, as Christ Himself is the light.  

You cannot hide the light under a basket or a bed; you place it on a lampstand. This metaphor speaks of Christ and of every one of us who become His followers, living out our faith and bearing the fruits of light. We will discuss this further shortly. The fruits of the Spirit are the fruits of light, as stated in Ephesians 5:9.  

First, we must understand that this world was created with day and night. Christians have always recognized this as symbolic.

The entire created world serves as a form of symbolism, revealing to us something about God and spiritual truths. This world is not absolute. We are not pagans who follow the sun or worship nature. For instance, we do not base our prayers or the hours of the day on the position of the sun, nor do we align ourselves with zodiac signs like Capricorn or others. Such practices are rooted in paganism.  

We do not worship nature; rather, we understand that nature is a parable about the kingdom of heaven and the Lord's revelation. Through the structure of this world, including the division between light and darkness, God communicates a message to us. In the age to come, on the day of the Lord, there will be no night. As Revelation 22:5 tells us, there will be no need for light or darkness, for the Lord Himself will be the light. We await the day of the Lord, not the night of the Lord.  

The absolute reality is the spiritual light. The physical light we experience in this world is merely a symbol of that divine light, while the darkness in this world symbolizes the apostasy that the majority of humanity follows. In a sense, the night in this world represents the entire age of this world. In our prayers, we often ask to be guided through the night of this age.  

Spiritually, the life we live in this physical world is akin to night for most people. This darkness, as described in the Gospel of John, encompasses the whole world. Only those who receive Christ are already children of the light revealed by God. As I mentioned in a previous video, when the heavens were torn apart, it was a profound revelation.  

The Lord said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." At His ascension, the angels declared that He would return in the same way He was taken up. During the time between His ascension and His second coming, the Lord remains concealed from the majority of the world. They do not see Him visibly. It is only through faith that we encounter Him and open ourselves to the kingdom of heaven.  

Recently, I had a dialogue with an atheist in China, which left me deeply saddened. He shared with me, "I don't understand what you're talking about. I don't have this experience. I've lived my whole life as an atheist." He is around 60 years old, and his entire life has been materialistic. The gate to spiritual understanding seems closed to him. He tried to comprehend, but such truths cannot be explained with mere words.  

Yet, we have this experience. The Lord has called us to His light, and we have received it. We are on the path of becoming more and more children of this light. Returning to the concept of night prayer, we pray during the night because we are children of the true light. We remain in the light even as the world descends into darkness and sleep.  

We also anticipate the light coming from the east, which symbolizes Christ, salvation, and light. The more we possess Christ and His light, the more we yearn for its full manifestation, to receive it in its entirety. This is a paradox: the more light we have, the more we desire it. Conversely, the deeper we are in apostasy, the less we feel the need for light, the less we understand it, and the less we seek it.  

This is why "to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away" (Matthew 13:12). At the same time, Babylon—the anti-church, the spirit of this world, the spirit of enmity toward God—offers its own substitute for the light.  

This substitute for the light can take many forms. It may appear as liberalism, where people claim enlightenment and say, "Do whatever you want."

It can manifest in various forms, such as Masonic occultism, Kabbalistic nonsense, New Age teachings, and other false revelations. Even within Christianity, there are counterfeit versions, such as Protestantism and Catholicism. For instance, in Catholicism, the Vatican is often seen as the source of light—encyclicals from the Pope are treated as revelations. They have their substitute for the true light in the form of papal authority.  

In Protestantism, the substitutes for light can range from rationalistic approaches to more charismatic expressions. Often, the more diplomas or theological degrees one has, the more "enlightened" they are considered to be. But this is merely a worldly version of Christianity—a facade that covers a worldly spirit with Christian terminology. It is not the true light of Christ.  

This Babylon, the spirit of the world, brings its own substitutes for light. Even on a physical level, we can identify two types of darkness. The first is ignorance—when someone is uneducated, driven solely by their passions, and immersed in a carnal, worldly life. They are spiritually asleep, devolving and indulging in the pleasures of this world. When night falls, they simply go to sleep because that is all they can do.  

The second type of darkness is far more intricate, sophisticated, and dangerous. It is the darkness of fake light—when it appears that you have light. Babylon loves to illuminate the night artificially. If you look at photos of developed, "civilized" countries from space, you’ll see them brightly lit. People try to overcome darkness with artificial lighting—cities filled with neon lights, homes brightly lit, and cafes glowing.  

Think of the rich man in the parable who celebrated every day with bright lamps in his house. This was merely a substitute, an attempt to escape the reality of his spiritual darkness. But such artificial light only leads to deeper darkness.  

True light, on the other hand, is always connected to deep repentance and a willingness to change oneself. It is selfless, devoid of vainglory or self-glorification. The more you possess the true light, the more the glory of God shines through your life. Yet, you realize that this light is not your own—it is not something you generate. You are merely a servant, a transmitter, like the moon reflecting the light of the sun. There is no room for pride in this.  

True light brings peace and joy. As Proverbs 15:30 says, "The light of the eyes rejoices the heart." If you go through a day without feeling the joy of being with God and Christ, it means you are still deprived of this light.  

Babylon, however, offers substitutes—fake joy and fake happiness. It might come from material possessions, intellectual achievements, or entertainment. But these are mere distractions, like morphine or drugs, creating an addiction that pulls you further from the true joy found in Christ.  

This is why breaking harmful habits—such as excessive movie-watching, gaming, or other distractions—can be so difficult. These substitutes provide a fleeting sense of happiness, diverting you from the true joy that comes from righteousness and the light of Christ.  

In summary, the true light of Christ is transformative, selfless, and brings genuine peace and joy. The substitutes offered by the world—whether through false religions, counterfeit Christianity, or artificial distractions—only lead to deeper darkness. As children of light, we must seek the true light of Christ, repent, and allow His glory to shine through us, reflecting His light to a world in need.

So, we must become increasingly aware of where we stand today. Are we truly walking in the light? The more we grow in this awareness, the more we will recognize what is not light. We will see how this world is engulfed in darkness, how it clings to false comfort and delusion, especially those who believe they are in the light but do not have Christ.  

This includes many Protestants and Catholics who, though they may claim to follow Christ, are living in self-deception, lacking the true light of Christ. May the Lord keep us awake and vigilant, guiding us through the night of this life and making us true servants and witnesses of His light.  

May He make us like lamps that cannot be hidden under a basket or a bed but are placed on a stand to shine for all in the house. May the Lord bless us, strengthen us on this path, and fill us with the joy of His salvation.  

Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
