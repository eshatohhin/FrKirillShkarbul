# Fear of the Jews, “Judeo-Christianity” and Martyrs in our time

"Dear brothers and sisters, during the Great Lent, we breathe fresh air, and our souls enjoy the blooming and revival brought by fasting, prayers, and spiritual reflection. We can use the metaphor of going on a field trip, a picnic, or sightseeing. When you return from these natural places, you feel the noise of the city, the technology, the complicated relationships between people, and the burden of civilization—especially the spiritual burden filled with passions, anxiety, noise, and useless running around. Similarly, when we go through the Great Lent, we feel that this world is crazy. When we encounter this Babylon—a world obsessed with useless things, where people quarrel over trivial matters and hold empty values—we see that people are blinded by the distractions of this world. We gain this feeling, especially during the Great Lent. We are supposed to gain this feeling because our true home is elsewhere; our home is with our Heavenly Father. This world has nothing truly exciting for us, nothing that motivates us to pursue it for its own sake. This is a different spirit. After breathing this fresh air, our souls can sense the foul odor of the sewage in this fallen world, where it becomes much harder to find the Lord. The Lord is everywhere, but when everything around you is created by mammon for the sake of efficiency and increased consumption, you feel it everywhere—in shopping malls, advertisements, radio, TV, and music. It is pervasive. 

We need to recognize the old man within ourselves—the one unwilling to fast, who sees it as a burden. This same old man fills us with all kinds of fears. Today, I want to say a few words about the fear of the Jews, which we read about in the Acts of the Apostles and the Gospels. In the Gospel, when the apostles were praying in a small room, they were afraid to go out before the news of the Resurrection. They feared the Jewish leaders, not the regular people. The leaders threatened to expel them from the synagogue, calling Jesus of Nazareth a criminal and warning that anyone associated with Him would be persecuted. This fear still lingers with us today. It is tied to many things—economic fears of market crashes, pandemics, collapses, immigration crises, robots taking jobs, or political upheavals. There is always anxiety, always uncertainty. This is the spirit of mammon, the spirit of Babylon. There is no peace; it is always troubled. 

Of course, people who do not believe in God fear one set of things, while Christians, especially Orthodox Christians, fear others. Some fear new measures of control, QR codes on their foreheads, or being brainwashed into becoming zombies. There are fears of electronic digital concentration camps. A Christian must beware, as the Lord said: 'Beware of men, for they will deliver you to councils and flog you in their synagogues. They will persecute you and kill you for My name's sake.'

So He said, "Beware. Do not have a rosy feeling that everything will be fine. No, they persecuted Me, and they will persecute you. They hated Me, and they will hate you." This is something to beware of, but not to be afraid of. For a Christian, the worst thing they can do to any of us is to kill us. Of course, they can harm our souls, but that is another matter. We must fear falling away from the Lord or betraying Him, but we should not fear being killed, tortured, or brainwashed. We are not afraid of such things. We must be aware of them and understand what is happening, but we should not become obsessed or fearful. With the Lord, no matter what happens—whether nuclear war or anything else—if we are with Him, there is nothing to worry about. Once you have this deep, profound peace in your heart, you will be ready to face anything. You will have a clear mind to distinguish right from wrong, and the Lord will grant you sound judgment. But this comes only if we love Him more than anything else.

During the Great Lent, we learn to put to death our old self—the one who is afraid, unwilling to fast, and attached to earthly things. We are killing this old self and overcoming this fear. I have been on mission trips to China, and I can tell you that even Christians, even Orthodox Christians, are very much afraid of the government. In authoritarian countries like Russia, China, and others with strict regimes—China being even stricter than Russia—people are afraid. They fear speaking out, being imprisoned, or having their social ratings lowered, which can deprive them of their rights. This fear is the same as the fear of the Jews. Of course, it is not always Jews who are the source of this fear today. Now, they use networks and algorithms to monitor who you are, what you do, where you go, and even what you think. But the effect is the same as the fear of the Jews that the early Church faced. Once the apostles received the Holy Spirit, they were no longer afraid. They knew the dangers but did not fear them. They spoke boldly and testified publicly to the truth of the Lord.

We must be aware of this fear. Another issue is the so-called Judaization of Christians and the entire world. Today, they speak of a "Judeo-Christian civilization." This is ironic because the ecumenical spirit is destroying every religion, reducing them all to the religion of Mammon. It mixes everything together. I have a video on Daedalism as a new religion, and many saints, such as St. Ephraim the Syrian and more recently Fr. Seraphim, have warned us that this would happen. We must be aware that this is occurring. In essence, it is the Judaization not only of Christianity but of every culture and religion. This is called Judeization, but it is not the Old Testament Judaism of Judah, which glorifies God. Rather, it is Talmudic Judaism, a different religion that opposes God because it rejects the true Messiah.

They wanted an alternative Messiah—the Antichrist. That is whom they desired. After rejecting Christ and the destruction of the Temple, the Old Testament Jewish religion came to an end. It was finished. The religion that gradually formed afterward is, in essence, the religion of the Antichrist. The god worshipped in this religion is Mammon. We must be clear about this. This spirit of Mammonism penetrates everywhere. Those who embrace this spirit are called "Mityagdim," meaning those who resemble Jews in their way of life and values. These values center on the worship of Mammon—prosperity, self-success, economic growth, or utopian visions like a bright socialist future. All religions that have fallen into apostasy, rejecting the true and loving God, fall into this category. Even Protestantism and Catholicism have strayed from Christ. This is the source of the Judaization of Christianity. 

Even within the Orthodox Church, this Judaizing heresy appeared in the 14th and 15th centuries in Russia. It was severe, with some church hierarchs being crypto-Judaists. This spirit persists today. As long as we prioritize earthly comfort, safety, prosperity, savings, and retirement plans, we have already surrendered to Mammon. Mammon rules our hearts, and we become crypto-Judaists. Humanists and those advocating for the blending of all religions are crypto-Judaists. They are the "maniac team," betraying Christ and becoming apostates. We, too, are apostates to the extent that we still cling to the old self within us. Every time we sin, we betray Christ, worship Satan, and serve Mammon. Let us first examine ourselves critically, and then we will understand what is happening in the world. We do not want to be part of the "maniac team," salt that has lost its saltiness. We do not want to cease being Christians. 

What is the solution? There are only two choices: either follow the path of the "maniac team" or become a Christian martyr. There is no middle ground. If we simply want to live as we are, we become part of the "maniac team." If we wish to follow Christ, the holy fathers tell us we must be ready to sacrifice our lives. At the very least, in our minds, we must decide that we are willing to lay down our lives for Christ if the opportunity arises. We are not to seek out such opportunities or provoke danger, but we must be prepared to make that sacrifice. In reality, we might flee from threats to our lives, property, or freedom, but the willingness to sacrifice must be present in our hearts.

We might betray Christ. We might say, "Yes, whatever you want," to avoid suffering. But at least in our minds, we must make the decision that we are willing to sacrifice for Him. Many Christians come to church seeking peace, solutions to problems, or a better job. They pray to God for these things. But when you speak to them about martyrdom, they say, "No, no, no. I just want to enjoy this life. I don’t want to die. That’s not why I came here." If you are not willing to die for Christ, you have come to the wrong place. The Lord said, "Take up your cross and follow Me." Follow Him where? To Golgotha, where He was nailed to the cross. You must be ready and willing to be nailed to the cross—not eagerly, but at least accepting it. 

Why do we have so few martyrs and saints today compared to the early Church? The early Church was much smaller than the Orthodox Church today, yet it produced countless martyrs. This lack of martyrs and saints is due to the Judaization of our faith. It happens because we lack decisiveness and are unwilling to embrace martyrdom. In Psalm 25, we read, "The Lord will give you according to your heart, and everything that you desire, you will accomplish." If we do not desire to be martyrs, we will not become martyrs. If we do not desire to be saints, we will not become saints. We must crave this. 

You might ask, "What if I don’t have the opportunity to become a martyr?" The Great Lent teaches us to become martyrs every day. Martyrdom means being a witness for Christ, testifying to His love—how Christ loved people and how we love Him. It involves sacrificing our passions, habits, and old self for His sake. This is what we do during the Great Lent. It is daily martyrdom—small, perhaps, but of the same nature. Our entire lives must become martyrdom, sacrificing our flesh and old self for Christ. We must break free from our attachment to comfort, tasty food, communication, and other worldly things. This is how Babylon enslaves people, making them happy slaves who owe nothing and feel content. But if we are only nominal Christians, we are nothing. 

Let us make a firm decision, deeply willing to sacrifice our lives for Christ. During the Great Lent, we repent of death because Lent is an experience of death—a foretaste of the end of life, the Second Coming. We go through a kind of hell during Lent because we repent, and the sinner feels worthy of hell. This is why the church is darker during this time, with fewer lights. It reflects our readiness to die so that we may live a new life in Christ. It is not we who die, but our old self. This earthly life can end at any moment, and in the church, we pray for a Christian end to our lives—blameless, shameless, and glorifying God through both our life and our death. 

The martyrs triumphed because their deaths were the ultimate manifestation of their love for God. They loved Him without reservation, even to the end. Only in this way can we enter the Kingdom of Heaven. There is no other path. Some hope to enter by being better teachers, parents, or improving in other ways, but these efforts alone are insufficient. True salvation comes through complete surrender and love for Christ, even unto death.

Some people think about nationalism or their ethnicity, striving to become better in those terms. But I can tell you that all these things can only be achieved when you become a good Christian. If we are true Christians, all the best qualities within our souls will awaken, and all our talents will flourish. If you want to be a great writer, become a great Christian. If you want to be a good father, become a good Christian. This is how you avoid the corruption brought by Judaization, the filthiness, and the earthly decay that comes from pride, selfishness, and arrogance—merging with mammon and the world, which offers nothing but corruption and destruction. These things have no value in the eyes of the Lord. Yet, people waste their lives, their energy, and even destroy their families for the sake of this filthy, stinking world. 

May the Lord help us become better Christians. May He grant the crowns of martyrs to those who crave Him most, or the crowns of saints. May He protect us from anything that corrupts our souls. Everything else is meaningless. Every other challenge we face is meant to make us better. Let us not fear any crisis, catastrophe, war, or anything else. The Spirit of the Lord, His peace, the joy of salvation, the joy of resurrection, and the feeling of His coming Kingdom—may these be with every one of us. God bless. And through us, may His blessing come upon the people around us. God bless.
