Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share some thoughts about pessimism and depression.  
From time to time, I visit different countries, and whether it’s Russia, the United States, or China, everywhere I see people who are deeply depressed.  
Now, this isn’t to say that depression is the only problem, because if you are excessively happy, we must also remember the words of Christ: “Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn later.”  
So, I’m not here to simply say, “Don’t be depressed, take it easy, be happy, enjoy your life,” or any of those motivational clichés.  
Today, I want to focus on the spiritual reasons behind this widespread depression and how to overcome it in a Christian way.  

The last three years, in particular, have been deeply depressing for most people in most countries. Many no longer have hope for the future or a desire to live.  
Of course, there are exceptions—perhaps some techno-optimists who believe that new technologies will make everything better, brighter, and cleaner, with clean energy and so on.  
But today, we’re not talking about them. Today, we’re talking about the majority of ordinary people who feel deeply depressed, and the numbers reflect this reality.  

Over the last three years, deaths from drug overdoses in the U.S. have reached 80,000 per year—three times higher than before.  
These are rough numbers, so don’t quote me on them, but if you look into it, you’ll see how staggering the increase has been.  

In Russia, I’ve observed that even young people are depressed. You see it in the super-modern downtown areas, where people are supposed to be optimistic about life, business, and new projects.  
Instead, they’re smoking—not just cigarettes, but now these little boxes of poison, some kind of new garbage.  
Whether it’s cigarettes or these new substances, it’s all harmful. It’s all an attempt to escape reality.  

Many people are also escaping into video games, social media, or online chats. These are all signs of deep depression.  
People don’t want to live in this world; they want to retreat into another world that feels more bearable.  

This wasn’t always the case. In the past, life didn’t feel as overwhelmingly depressing as it does now.  
For example, in Russia, you see people going to war—not because they’re excited about it, but because they need money or have been drafted.  
It’s a deeply depressing situation. Many of these individuals understand they are going to die, and they accept it because they no longer see life as worth living.  
When people lose hope for the future, they lose the will to live. This is a simple but tragic truth.  

Even in monasteries and churches, you often see people with lifeless eyes. There’s no spark of life in them because their hearts are filled with hopelessness.  
This is shocking when you consider that Christians are supposed to have the life of Christ within them. Yet, in many cases, this vitality is missing.  

This brings us to a crucial point: when people no longer want to live—a basic instinct even among animals—it means something is deeply wrong.  
If humans, who are created in the image of God, lose the will to live, it’s a sign that things have become worse than even the animal kingdom.

This frustration that arises is rooted in what we call *sorrow for this world*. Sorrow for this world occurs when we place high expectations on the world and on ourselves, but those expectations go unmet.  
You don’t achieve what you hoped for, and you become depressed. This could stem from something as simple as bad weather, an unfriendly phone call, or hearing distressing news about wars or disasters in other parts of the world.  
You’re depressed because things aren’t going the way you want them to.  

Now, the entire world is trapped in what’s called the “new normality”—a state of constant stress, where everything feels on the verge of collapse.  
Every day brings news of another impending disaster, and people no longer have bright expectations for the future.  
It’s natural, then, that they feel depressed. This is entirely understandable.  

When people are depressed, they often fall into sin. They stop caring about their health, their families, and their responsibilities. Families collapse, people die, and this is exactly what the enemy wants.  
This is why we’re losing.  

To overcome this, we must start on an individual level. We can’t save the whole world, but we can begin by saving ourselves.  
Our first goal is to develop a spiritual vaccine against all forms of depression. This vaccine comes from a different kind of sorrow—*sorrow for the heavens*.  

When we repent and pray—whether it’s the Jesus Prayer or simply crying out, “Lord, have mercy”—we experience sorrow for being distant from God due to our sins.  
This sorrow creates a living dialogue with the Lord, and this dialogue transforms everything for us.  
We become willing to carry our cross, and the cross itself becomes our treasure. We find meaning in each day, knowing that the Lord has given us a mission and that we are working toward a final goal.  

That final goal—union with God in His kingdom—is greater than anything this world can offer. But to reach it, we must endure the challenges of each day.  
The more days we are given, the more good we can do, and the greater our reward will be.  

For a Christian with a vibrant spiritual life, there is a powerful motivation to live each day with purpose.  
The Lord provides the strength to face even the most painful and terrible realities.  

However, when people are unwilling to carry their cross, when they fall into spiritual numbness or even spiritual death, they become depressed.  
Even the faithful—those in monasteries and churches—can lose their faith, their purpose, and their motivation to keep going.  

The solution to this problem is entirely different from the artificial, man-made solutions offered by the world.  
For example, there’s the Dale Carnegie approach, which encourages you to convince yourself that you’re great, that your life is wonderful, and that you have a bright future ahead.  
It’s all about changing your mindset and forcing yourself into happiness.  

But this approach is ultimately unsustainable. People will inevitably fail and burn out.  
Similar ideas were promoted in socialist countries, and they still linger in places like China.  
The message is that there’s a bright future to build, and you are powerful enough to create it.  

While these worldly solutions may offer temporary relief, they fail to address the deeper spiritual void that leads to depression.  
The true solution lies in turning to God, embracing the cross, and finding meaning in our union with Him.  
Only then can we overcome the sorrow of this world and live with hope, purpose, and strength.

We are told that together, we are building a bright future—a bright country. "You, me, him, all of us, working together, will make everything successful."  
Industrialization, science, technology—we will conquer Mars and other planets, and so on.  

But this rhetoric, this ideology, is ultimately empty because it is not rooted in Christ. It lacks the blessing of the Lord.  
It’s merely a way of manipulating the human mind, drawing people into an illusion of progress and achievement.  
Yet, it is hollow at its core. In the end, you will burn out, and the system will discard you. That’s the reality.  

Anything that is fake, artificial, or a challenge to God—saying, "I can do it myself, we can do it without Him"—is a form of rebellion against the Lord.  
God does want us to be creative, active, and responsible stewards of His creation.  
But we must do this in harmony with the Creator, following His laws rather than setting our own.  

Let us remain humble. Let us avoid both extremes: the pessimistic, depressive mindset that dominates so many today, and the false optimism that relies on human strength alone.  
While there are few who appear happy and capable, even this can be dangerous if it is not grounded in Christ.  

There are many signs that the Lord has not abandoned His Church. We have miraculous icons, such as myrrh-streaming icons, and holy people within the Church.  
I have met some of these individuals, though they are not the majority.  
You don’t walk into a monastery or a parish and find everyone overflowing with Christ’s love. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  

However, it is only in the Church that people can find the key—the portal, if you will—to true enlightenment, power, and motivation to follow Christ.  
We take up our cross and find joy in carrying it. We are ready to go as far as the Lord calls us.  
As He said, "If someone forces you to go one mile, go with them two."  

No matter how heavy the burdens of this world may be, as long as we remain loyal to Christ, we are ready to endure.  
May the Lord grant us this motivation, this strength, and this unwavering faith.  
May He give us a living dialogue with Him—a direct, personal connection.  

When we are alone in our rooms, we must speak to Christ directly.  
I will share more about prayer in future videos, but this cannot be overstated:  
You must have a living, dynamic prayer life and a real relationship with Jesus Christ.  
It’s not about memorizing prayers; it’s about daily, heartfelt communication with Him. This is the key.  

May the Lord teach us to pray, to be humble, and to walk in His wisdom.  
May He give us the strength to face any challenge that comes our way.  

God bless.
