# How to distinguish wrong spirits

Dear brothers and sisters, today we live in this era of the internet, and when we are interested in spirituality and trying to find a path to Jesus Christ, to union with God, we often see that there are so many different sources and speakers. Everyone is talking about Christ, faith, and God, but they very often contradict each other and have very different approaches, and the message is quite different. We know that these days there are many denominations and congregations, and within those congregations, there are people with different ideas and opinions. Today, we will not talk about the dogma of faith, doctrines, or doctrinal differences. We will talk about the spirit that we can perceive when we listen to some speakers. And we will see that sometimes this spirit is contrary to the basic message of Jesus Christ. So, we should be aware of this and not rely too much on any speaker. Having this awareness serves as a vaccine against spiritual harm that can come, especially if we consider ourselves to be testifying about Christ on the internet. We also need to be aware of these things and avoid them. Otherwise, it will be very immature, and instead of helping people find God, we will make them turn away from Him. 

In this era of YouTube and the internet, we should not rely too much on these things. For us, the most important is the Gospel, Holy Communion, repentance, and prayer. We should not become overly dependent on these sources or this media because it can lead us astray. We can become lost in the virtual world and develop all kinds of addictions to these things. We are here, testifying on the internet, only because people are here, and we need to testify wherever people are—not because we want them to become reliant and dependent on these things. So today, we will talk about these different spirits, not to criticize people or say that they are all away from God, but for us to become more knowledgeable and wiser in listening to things about God and discerning what is true and what is false. The Apostle Paul himself said, "Know how to distinguish between different spirits. Not all spirits come from God." So today, we will talk about these spirits.

The first spirit that is very common is the spirit of self-love. The speaker talks a lot about themselves, introducing their story, their life, and presenting themselves from different angles. "This is me." This is common today because of the spirit of narcissism that prevails. People post many photos of themselves on Facebook and everywhere else, and they enjoy looking at themselves and having others look at them and give them likes. This is a very sick, unhealthy phenomenon because, for a Christian, the most important thing is Christ and God, not oneself. What people post on Facebook is often what is most interesting to them. This frequently happens with people who talk about God and Christ, and we forget Christ's commandment: "Whoever wants to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. And whoever wants to be my disciple must lose his soul to find it. For whoever saves his soul will lose it, and whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it." So, we need to forget about ourselves and think only about ministry to God, His Church, and His people.

The second spirit is what I call the spirit of a corporation or politics. When people say, "Oh, this is our organization. This is our church. This is our mission. These are our activities and accomplishments. Come here, join us." This is also very common. Everything related to us is portrayed as super good, and there is an effort to solidify positions. "We are this, we are that."

And for Christ, all of that is meaningless. For Him, what matters is that He lives in the hearts of men. Whoever is with Him is the Church, and it is important that He is united with us—not that we drag people into some organization. So, this is also a spirit that is quite far from Christ. 

Another spirit is the spirit of opinion. People say, "This is my opinion. You want to hear my opinion? This is my opinion on that. My opinion on this is that." Well, the Holy Father has told us that we cannot trust our own opinions. We need to see what the Gospel says. And if we don’t find the answer there, we need to pray a lot and seek signs to discern whether a judgment aligns with the Gospel or not. If we don’t have proof from God that something is true—not because it’s my opinion, but because it’s true in itself—then we need to say, "Well, I don’t really know what the truth is. But as far as I can judge or understand up to now, I think it’s like that. Maybe I’m wrong." People need to be humble enough to say things like that. 

Another spirit is the Pharisee spirit. The Lord Himself said, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees." This spirit manifests when people think they are holy and everyone else is evil. They label others as heretics or wrong. Such people lack love for others. The sign of this Pharisee spirit is the absence of love. People simply try to accuse: "This is wrong, this is not good." This, too, is far from Christ. 

Another spirit, the fifth one, is the spirit of fear. When people constantly talk about the Antichrist, evil everywhere, conspiracies, and how we must always be on guard—this is fear. In a Christian, there is no fear except the fear of God—fear of sinning and falling away from His grace. We are not afraid of anything else. We are not blind to the existence of evil or the reality of the Antichrist, but we do not live in fear of these things. 

The sixth spirit, which is somewhat the opposite of the previous one, is the spirit of excessive optimism. It’s the "hallelujah, everything is fine" attitude. "Everything is great. We are with God. God loves you. Everything is wonderful." This spirit lacks the fear of God.

This spirit has no reverence for God's justice or His potential for punishment. It is marked by overconfidence and self-assurance, which can lead to delusion. It’s like in a movie where a superhero is shot at repeatedly but never dies. People start to think they are invincible like that superhero, but in real life, it’s different. This kind of spirit is deceptive and mistaken. 

Another spirit we encounter is the military spirit. This is when people adopt an aggressive attitude, believing that violence or force can prove their truth. They might say, "If the Church had the government’s power or bombs, we could prove we are right." Or they might suggest that it’s acceptable for a Christian to punish someone who is doing wrong. Those who speak like this carry aggression within them, and we must be cautious of this spirit. 

The last spirit we’ll discuss today is the spirit of intellectual pride—enjoying and showing off one’s erudition, intelligence, education, or knowledge. This is common among those with higher education. The Apostle Paul warns that knowledge can make one arrogant and proud, and there is no room for Christ in a proud heart. There is nothing inherently wrong with knowledge, learning, or education—it is good. But we must be aware of the risk of pride that comes with it. 

By listing these different spirits, you may have recognized some of them in the content you listen to or watch on the internet. However, this doesn’t mean we should avoid everything, labeling it all as harmful, bad, or antichrist. Not at all. When we have this "vaccine"—the ability to discern—we can distinguish what is harmful from what is not. We can say, "This is harmful; maybe I don’t need to watch that," or "This has some of those spirits, but it’s not entirely bad. I can still draw some valuable insights from it." 

Let us be very mindful. To avoid falling into these traps, we must cultivate humility in our hearts, engage in prayer and repentance, and remain united with Christ. Receiving Holy Communion is crucial, as is regularly reading the Gospel and the lives of the saints. These practices anchor us in truth and prevent us from being misled or becoming overly reliant on any individual, even if they are priests or missionaries. 

This grounding will protect us from harm, deepen our union with God, and enable us to carry out effective ministry and testimony for our Lord Jesus Christ. May the Lord help you, protect you, and grant you wisdom. Amen.
