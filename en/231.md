# Issues with reviving the Faith in “Orthodox” countries

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share with you some thoughts about what has happened in the so-called Orthodox countries after the fall of communism and atheism, which occurred about 30-35 years ago. Following that period, in those former Soviet countries, we have witnessed a significant revival of the Church.

Some people were amazed to see something that had been destroyed. If you had visited those countries in the 70s or early 80s, you would have found little to no Orthodox presence. There might have been some churches, but they would have been more like museums, and most churches would have been used as storage facilities, laboratories, or museums. There would have been no services; they would have been completely secularized, and nobody would have cared about faith. Most people you met on the street would have been atheists, or they would have concealed their belief in God and never attended church.

I still remember those days when it seemed that Orthodoxy was finished, with no hope of revival. Now, when we speak about Orthodox countries, we need to remember that all of them went through this period of atheism. What we see now is a completely different picture from what it was like 40 years ago.

However, there are significant problems. It's difficult to discuss these issues without considering society as a whole. The world is changing everywhere. Over the last 35 years, society, social values, globalization, politics, and economics have all undergone transformations. When we talk about the fruits of survival, it's very hard not to consider all these factors. But today, I want to avoid delving into those, as otherwise, we could talk forever.

Today, I want to focus on some main developments and the primary problems or shortcomings within the Church, not society as a whole. I'm not talking about everyone; I'm talking about the Church specifically—what we have now after 35 years of relative freedom and this revival.

First, I'll share with you the fruits, the good things, along with some shortcomings. Then, later, I'll discuss the significant issues we face.

The overall attitude towards Christianity and the Orthodox faith has improved significantly. Most people in Russia now would call themselves Orthodox, even if they don't attend church or know much about Orthodoxy. This provides a great opportunity to talk about faith. In the past, discussing faith would have caused people to distance themselves from you, thinking you were a fanatic or something unhealthy. Everyone was focused on building a socialist future, and talking about faith was seen as retrograde, something from the 19th century. The attitude was very different.

As I mentioned, most people are not deeply engaged in their faith, which is, of course, a shortcoming. This means we need to do more in terms of education, preaching, and testimony within the Church. Many people who are baptized are already considered part of the Church in some sense. Of course, many have become truly Orthodox, attending church regularly. There are now many more churches than there used to be—around 40,000 in Russia alone, not including Ukraine, Belarus, and other countries—and they are full on Sundays. This indicates that more people have become practicing Orthodox believers, and even those who don't attend church now know more about faith than they did 40 years ago. There has been significant development in this regard.

If you go to a non-Orthodox country, you won't find the same situation. Here in Taiwan, for example, it's different, and even in Europe or the United States, the situation is very different. It's truly a great pleasure to see many people who are genuinely Orthodox and living in faith, with a faith that is alive, not just formal.

So, this is real, and it is not something superficial or fake. Another significant development is the great variety of books, videos, and articles available about faith and spiritual life. If you are Orthodox, you now have access to many more resources in every respect that can help you on your spiritual path. This is truly helpful for Orthodox people, clergy, monks, and everyone involved—it is a great, great help. Many books are being translated into Russian, which is also a very visible and evident development.

However, this comes with its shortcomings. Sometimes, the focus is on quantity rather than quality—publishing many books simply to meet a goal. There isn’t always much emphasis on the content of those books, and bureaucratic issues are hard to avoid. Nevertheless, this still provides much more opportunity for the faithful to grow, learn, and advance in their spiritual lives. Overall, this is a positive development.

Another good development is the recovery of many monasteries. There are now about 1,000 monasteries, and they allow people to learn more about faith by observing how it is lived out. Participating in prayers and the life of the monastery is a great, great development. However, with all these monasteries being recovered and the many facilities built for pilgrims and church-related activities, the focus has often been on construction and infrastructure. Now, it is time to place more emphasis on spiritual life itself, which was not as prioritized during this period of development. While we have the infrastructure for spiritual life, there is still a lack of depth in spiritual life in some places, particularly in certain monasteries.

So, these are the developments we have seen over the past 35 years. Alongside these positive changes, we also face some problems. We need to recognize these issues because, without criticism, we cannot develop or grow. We should be brave and not afraid of self-criticism.

One of the biggest problems is the reliance on sponsors and the government. This reliance comes with limited freedom. If the Church receives funding from the government, state companies, or other institutions, it becomes constrained in its ability to criticize them. This includes criticizing policies, inequality, lack of righteousness, or issues within the judicial system. While this funding allows the Church to expand its missions—preaching in hospitals, on TV, on the radio, in schools, in the army, and in prisons—it also comes with trade-offs. The Church cannot fully speak out against societal issues when it is financially dependent on these entities.

There is too much ideological influence on the Church. It should be the other way around: the Church should set the agenda, defining what is right and wrong and guiding society toward evangelization and health. However, too often, the Church follows the agenda of external forces. This is a significant shortcoming, and I have discussed this in my past videos.

Another problem is that, despite the revival and the positive developments, societal issues persist. People still harm one another, engage in drug use, smoking, abortion, and other destructive behaviors. If things are getting worse in society, we cannot simply say everything is good. This is a problem we must address.

Additionally, many people within the Church approve of wrong policies. I need to be careful with my words here, but if there is an ideological lie, we must recognize it as such. The Church must remain truthful and not align itself with falsehoods, even if they are politically or socially convenient.

These are some of the challenges we face as we continue to grow and develop. While there is much to celebrate, we must also confront these issues with honesty and courage.

But many church leaders and regular faithful do not see these issues. This indicates that there are spiritual problems within us. If we cannot recognize a lie, we end up supporting the destructive systems that exist today. I won’t say more on this, as it might lead to this video being flagged or restricted. Of course, not everyone supports these problematic dynamics, but many do, and that is a significant issue.

Another major problem we face is weakness, particularly in external mission work. There is a great task for the Church to focus on internal mission within countries that were historically Orthodox. Some efforts are being made—I mentioned books, TV programs, and other initiatives. While these efforts are not enough, they are steps in the right direction. However, when it comes to external mission, we are lacking. For example, it was only recently that English-language Liturgies began in Moscow. There are now, I think, two places where you can attend an English Liturgy, which is far from sufficient.

I have also tried to find Orthodox literature in English, but there is very little available. You might find some, but it’s almost nothing compared to the abundance of books in Russian. You often have to order online to get anything, which is strange considering the vast resources available in Russian. Interestingly, there are more books on Orthodoxy in Chinese available in Moscow than in English, which is quite telling of the imbalance.

Generally speaking, we lack a strong platform for communication with society, even within Russia. There is a need for dialogue with academia, business leaders, the elite, the intelligentsia, and young people. The Church remains a minority, even in countries like Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The number of truly faithful people is small, and there is a pressing need for a platform to engage with the broader society. Right now, this platform is lacking, and we need to do more.

These are the main points I wanted to highlight. Every time I visit these countries, I am left with a question: With all this development and revival, do we have more of Christ? Do we see more of His presence both within the Church and in society at large? Do we feel a greater influence of Christian values and testimony in society and within the Church at the parish level? I won’t provide an answer here because I am still reflecting on this myself. I am not a prophet or a saint to claim that I know where Christ is more or less present. But I have some thoughts, and I hope you will also reflect on this.

Of course, the first task is to ensure that we ourselves are with Christ. This is the main goal. Without this, we cannot have the spiritual understanding needed to address these issues. May we have the humility, the wisdom from the Lord, and the courage to critique ourselves, to grow, and to bring Christ to our families and those around us. May His blessing and His kingdom come into the hearts of more and more people. Amen. May the Lord’s grace and blessing be with all of you and with me.
