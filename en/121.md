# We live in Apostasy. What forms can it take

Dear brothers and sisters, I am once again in Taichung. It has been one month since my last visit, and we just had the divine service last night, meeting with the community here. Today, as we are in the land of Advent, the Christmas Land, I want to say a few words about apostasy, a time when the whole world was expecting the Messiah, just as we are now expecting Christmas. However, they were expecting a different Messiah, who is actually the Antichrist. Therefore, we must wait for Christ and not mistake anyone else for Him.

For this reason, today I want to address the greatest problem of humanity and of every individual, including myself. This problem is apostasy. Apostasy means standing apart or separating oneself, leading to alienation from God. This alienation will be the reason why this world will be destroyed. We often do not think deeply about what kind of alienation is possible, but there are various forms of alienation from God that occur. We need to recognize it within ourselves and in the world at large.

We see that Christ criticized the Pharisees most severely. He called them "sons of the devil," even though they worshipped God, had the temple, the Holy Scriptures, and the law of Moses. They prayed many times a day, fasted, and performed many other religious acts. Yet, He called them "sons of the devil." Why is this so?

The reason lies in the meaning of the word "satan" in Hebrew. The word "satan" has three definitions or meanings. The first, as we know, is "adversary"—someone who is against, opposed to, or an enemy of God. The second meaning is "one who is separated" or "alienated." We know that the devil, once Lucifer, was the light-bearer, the closest to God, a highly talented and bright angel. But at some point, he decided that he could rule on his own, that he could be king and almighty, and he followed his own plan. As a result, he fell and became the prince of darkness and the prince of this world. This separation and alienation are what make him the devil.

The third meaning is "one who blocks" or "prevents." Satan prevents the Lord's plan from being accomplished and hinders the servants of God. For example, Paul writes to the Romans, "I wanted to come to you, but Satan hindered me; he did not allow me to do this." Thus, Satan can even hinder an apostle like Paul. These three meanings—adversary, separated, and blocker—are interconnected.

The word "satan" is often used with the definite article "ha," meaning "the satan" or "the devil." However, in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, it is also used without the article to refer to a human adversary—someone who opposes you in a trial, in war, or in any conflict. This is why Satan enjoys dividing people, pitting them against each other so that he may triumph. These are the methods of the devil, and they are also the basis of modern destructive competition, where the goal is to destroy competitors. Without regulatory measures to control this process, such competition would destroy itself. This destructive nature makes people resemble Satan.

This is why Christ called Peter "Satan." When Peter urged Him not to go to the cross, suggesting an alternative plan, Christ said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man." By opposing God's plan, Peter was acting like Satan. To the extent that we oppose God, separate ourselves from Him, and become His enemies, we too are like Satan.

How is this possible? There are different types of this alienation. We know that in societies, there are free Christian societies, like here in Taiwan and in most of Southeast Asia. There are also post-Christian societies, such as those in Europe and the United States, where people once followed Christ but have since departed and even become hostile to Christ and Christianity. Additionally, there is a third type, where people pretend to be Christians but are not truly so.

This situation is illustrated in the book of Revelation, where the Lord addresses the seven churches. To the church in Smyrna, He says, "I have this against you: you have abandoned your first love. Repent and return to the deeds you did at first. Otherwise, I will come and remove your lampstand from its place." This means that unless the church repents, God will withdraw His grace from it. He does not accuse them of heresy or moral corruption but points to their lack of fervent faith. This describes many of us who strive to be Christians but fall short in our daily lives and actions.

There are several ways of departing from God, often without even realizing it. At least four ways can be identified:

1. **Faith and Doctrine**: The content of what we believe can lead us astray. There are various heresies and incorrect teachings about Christ and God. This is one way we can become alienated—through distorted beliefs.

2. **Moral Life**: Our moral and virtuous life can deteriorate. We may fall into sin, succumb to passions, become arrogant, greedy, or engage in other immoral behaviors. This is another form of separation from God—a moral alienation.

3. **Worldview and Values**: Our values and worldview can shift away from God. We may embrace philosophies like materialism, liberalism, or self-centered humanism, which place humanity at the center of everything, a trend that emerged after the Renaissance. Alternatively, we might prioritize mammonism—another term for capitalism—where profit, money, and consumerism become our focus. Some may idolize modern philosophers, such as Heidegger, adopting their worldview instead of grounding themselves in the Gospel. Our worldview must come directly from the Gospel and the teachings of the Holy Church.

4. **Lukewarm Faith**: Even if we avoid major sins and hold correct beliefs, our faith can grow lukewarm. In Revelation, the Lord warns against being neither hot nor cold but lukewarm. Cold faith is outright opposition to God, while hot faith is a passionate, daily commitment to live for Him. Lukewarm faith is a dangerous middle ground where we are neither fully committed nor entirely opposed. God desires that we seek Him earnestly in all things, placing Him at the center of our lives.

This is the way to combat apostasy and alienation. Let us strive to live such a life, seeking to recover and inspire ourselves by asking for the gifts that come from God. In Isaiah 11:2, seven gifts of the Spirit are mentioned: the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the Spirit of strength, the Spirit of knowledge, and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord. We must develop these spirits and receive these gifts from the Lord to strengthen our faith and resist alienation.

And in the same way, when we lose the Lord, there are different ways of losing Him. Therefore, we must ask for a pure and simple heart, for unless we become like children, we will not enter the kingdom of heaven. The Pharisees were not like children; they had established institutions, systems of rituals, methods of teaching, and governance over the people of Israel. Everything was in place, but there was no room for God. They were wise in their own eyes, but Christ said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children." Those who relied on their wisdom and understanding were deprived of the true knowledge of God.

This is what we lack. We must abandon the mindset of "I know," "I have experience," or "I can live my life on my own." No, we cannot do it. We cannot live without Christ. Without Him, our lives become meaningless and futile. We must break ourselves, like an old piece of wood that needs to be reshaped, and become like a tender, young sprout that can bend and grow. We must open our hearts to the living God, allowing Him to dwell within us and guide our lives.

May the Lord grant us such faith and eagerness, so that we may avoid apostasy, tribulations, and the destruction that is coming upon this world. May He bless each and every one of you.

One final point I want to emphasize is that this world often demands that we bow to Satan. This is another form of apostasy, though it may not always be overt. It doesn’t require openly rejecting Christ, but it manifests in the choices we make. For example, when you are offered a job that requires you to cheat, slander, or act against your faith, and you choose that job for the sake of money, you are bowing to Satan. This is the same temptation Satan presented to Christ: "If you bow down and worship me, I will give you all the kingdoms of the world and their glory." But Christ refused, and so must we. Let us resist such temptations and remain steadfast in our faith, keeping Christ at the center of our lives.

This is the root of every apostasy. When someone draws closer to God, they will inevitably face an offer from Satan. This happens frequently. In politics, for example, we know how corrupt it can be. To rise to power, one often feels compelled to engage in immoral acts—betraying others, compromising integrity, or even committing violence. Once you are entangled in such actions, you become bound to that system. People often say, "After you graduate, how will you sell yourself?" Think about that phrase: "sell yourself." You become a commodity, owned by others. Many of us do this because we desire money, power, or pleasure. But in doing so, we are bowing to Satan.

Let us strive to live in truth, even if it means not being wealthy or powerful. It is better to live humbly and remain close to Christ, avoiding the tribulations that come from apostasy. Throughout history, tribulations have come upon nations and communities because of their alienation from God. The exile of Israel to Babylon occurred because they turned to foreign gods and rejected God’s rule, demanding a king instead. God told Samuel, "They have rejected Me as their king." This was a form of apostasy. Later, the temple was destroyed, the people were scattered, and a third of the population was killed because they turned away from God. Similarly, Christian nations have faced plagues, wars, and natural disasters as tribulations for their apostasy.

Christ Himself prophesied these tribulations, and the book of Revelation describes the woes and disasters that will fall upon the world because humanity has alienated itself from God. These tribulations are meant to lead people to repentance, but many still refuse to turn back to God. The holy fathers and the Scriptures warn us of this. We must be vigilant, recognizing our own small apostasies, for they accumulate into larger societal apostasy. When a society becomes immoral, like Sodom and Gomorrah, it paves the way for the Antichrist to exploit these trends and gain control.

Marx’s theory of capitalism highlights the alienation of workers from capital, a systematic process inherent in that system. However, the new social structures being implemented today aim to alienate individuals from themselves and from God. This is done systematically, whether people realize it or not. Traditional cultures, which are often closer to God’s plan, are being replaced by postmodern ideologies that distance people from their conscience, character, and ultimately from God. This alienation is designed to prepare the way for the kingdom of the Antichrist.

Let us be aware of this and examine our own lives for signs of apostasy. Let us repent and return to our first love, dedicating ourselves to serving the Lord and others. May the Lord grant us the heart of a child—pure, humble, and strong in faith—so that we may overcome all temptations and remain steadfast in His truth.
