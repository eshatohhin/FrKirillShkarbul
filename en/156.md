# Pentecost a nice tradition or the only source of Life

Dear brothers and sisters, we have arrived at the Great Feast of Pentecost.  
This feast is directly connected to the resurrection of Christ.  
It occurs exactly 50 days after the resurrection of Christ.  
We know that 50 represents completion—49 is 7 times 7, and on the 50th day, it was the jubilee year. During this time, all slaves were released, all debts were forgiven, and the land was allowed to rest.  
This also symbolizes eternity. Seven days represent a week, and the eighth day signifies the eternal day. With 7 times 7, the next day marks the day of completion.  
So, what does this completion mean? What is its significance?  

To gain a deeper understanding of Pentecost, we must discuss the Holy Spirit, for this is the day when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles.  
They received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and became one church—no longer scattered, individual disciples, but now one body of Christ.  
The significance of this event is immense, as it marks the beginning of the liturgical year, extending all the way to the next year's Lent. Every Sunday thereafter is counted as the first Sunday of Pentecost, the second Sunday of Pentecost, and so on, until we enter the Great Lent.  
This means the Church lives in the spirit of Pentecost continually. Yet, for many of us, it remains unclear what we receive. Yes, the disciples received the Holy Spirit in the form of flames that rested upon each apostle’s head—a profound event. They spoke in different languages and preached the Gospel to many nations. But what about us? What changes for us? What are we praying for? What is special about this feast if we do not have the Holy Spirit? What should we pray for?  

We also recognize this as the Feast of the Holy Trinity, and there are reasons for this.  
Let us briefly consider the Holy Trinity. Without delving too deeply into theology, we can say that the will, the divine plan, and the order of all things originate from God the Father. He is the source, the origin, and the reason for everything.  
This is why God the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father—because the Father is the origin and reason for all things. His will, the divine will, flows from the Father.  
God the Son is the Holy Word, the Word of God. This Word is not merely what the Lord speaks to the world but also what He accomplishes. This begins with creation, which is why we say the world was created "through the Son"—not as a medium, but as the active agent. Whatever God does in this world is accomplished through the Son. This is why the great work of salvation was fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who is the Word of God.  
Now, the Holy Spirit brings the entire project to fruition. He is the life-giving Spirit, giving life to the world and sustaining it. More importantly, He sustains us spiritually, granting us spiritual life. He ensures that the mission of Christ bears fruit and is fulfilled in this world.  
This is why we say that the Acts of the Apostles—what occurred after the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples—is the Gospel of the Holy Spirit. It is the work accomplished by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not confined to the spiritual realm; we see His work manifested in the material world as well. Many things accomplished in this world are brought about by the descent of the Holy Spirit.

Having said this—though it is very brief and general—let us keep this overall understanding of the Holy Trinity in mind. God is the Holy Trinity, and this is central to our faith.  

Now, let us focus on the Holy Spirit, a vast and profound topic. There are many aspects we could explore: Spirit versus matter, Spirit versus body, or the relationship between soul, body, and Spirit. We could discuss Spirit and information, which is abstract and intangible, or Spirit and ideas—the world of ideas. Some even equate Spirit with energy, thinking of it as a force that fills you, creating a sense of divine influx. However, this is a misunderstanding. There are countless dimensions to the concept of Spirit and the Holy Spirit, but we cannot cover them all today.  

Instead, I want to focus on what the Lord Himself said during the Last Supper, before His departure. In John 14:15-17, Jesus tells His disciples:  
*"If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever—the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you."*  

We often pray to the Holy Spirit, addressing Him as the "Heavenly King, the Comforter." But what does "Comforter" mean? In Greek, the word is *Parakletos* (though the stress is on *Paraklētos*). In Hebrew, the term is *Menachem*, derived from the verb *nacham*. While we could delve deeply into this, let us focus on the most important aspects.  

First, we see that Jesus says, "I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Comforter." Who is the Comforter now? Jesus Himself was the Comforter while He was physically present with His disciples on earth. The term "Comforter" carries several key meanings:  
1. **Someone to rely upon**: The disciples followed Jesus, and He guided them. When the Pharisees challenged them, they turned to Him for support. He was their source of reliance and guidance.  
2. **Advocate or Vindicator**: Jesus defended His disciples against accusations, standing up for them and interceding on their behalf.  
3. **Intercessor**: He prayed for them, bringing their needs before God the Father.  

All these roles are encapsulated in the word "Comforter." Now, Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will take on this role. The Holy Spirit will be their source of support, guidance, and defense. When they feel lonely or unsupported by friends or family, the Holy Spirit will sustain them. When they need direction and cannot rely on their own understanding, the Holy Spirit will guide them. When they face accusations, the Holy Spirit will be their advocate, defending and protecting them.  

Jesus also reminds them that when they are brought before synagogues or councils and accused, they should not worry about what to say. The Holy Spirit will give them the words to speak at the right moment. This testimony of truth is made possible through the Holy Spirit, who enables us to bear witness to Christ.  

In summary, the Holy Spirit is our Helper, Comforter, and Reliance. He supports us, guides us, defends us, and intercedes for us. Through Him, we are empowered to live as witnesses of Christ in the world.

We now face two situations where we often need someone to rely on for support.  

**The first situation** is when we feel overwhelmed, lost, or failing in various aspects of life. We may seek a second opinion, crave someone to stand by our side, or long for guidance. Yet, when no one is there, we can fall into depression, feeling abandoned and defeated. In these moments, we pray for the Lord to be with us, for the Holy Spirit to descend upon us, so that we may rely on Him. He becomes our Comforter, our source of strength and guidance when human support is absent.  

**The second situation** is when we experience harm, loss, or injustice. Perhaps something is stolen from us, or someone causes us pain. In such moments, we lose our peace. We may frantically try to recover what was lost, seek compensation, or even desire retaliation. This turmoil creates a gap within us—a sense of frustration and unrest. The Holy Spirit, as our Comforter, relieves us from these burdens. No matter what happens, He brings us peace and relief, freeing us from the need to retaliate or despair.  

This is why the Feast of Pentecost is so significant. The world cannot see or hear the Holy Spirit, but we, as believers, experience His presence in a profound and spiritual way. It is important to clarify that the Holy Spirit is not merely a feeling or an emotional experience. While feelings can be fleeting and tied to physical or emotional stimuli—like the sensation of cold water or the warmth of a sauna—the Holy Spirit operates on a much deeper, spiritual level.  

We must also be cautious of false manifestations. Some sects claim that the Holy Spirit causes people to fall down, laugh uncontrollably, or speak in strange ways. These phenomena are not of the Holy Spirit but may stem from other, deceptive spirits.  

In the Old Testament, the word for Spirit is *ruach*, which means "wind" or "breath." Similarly, the Hebrew word for Comforter, *menachem*, is related to the verb *nacham*, which conveys the idea of relief or breath. When we are spiritually oppressed—whether by the pressures of the world, our own passions, or external trials—we feel as though we cannot breathe. The Holy Spirit, as our Comforter, gives us spiritual breath. He relieves us from suffering, pressure, and temptation, even while we remain in the midst of trials.  

Through the Holy Spirit, we are not conquered by our circumstances. We are not shaken. He sustains us, giving us the spiritual wellness and resilience to endure. This is not about physical or emotional relief, as in yoga or other practices, but about the profound, life-giving breath of the Spirit that restores our souls and strengthens us in the face of adversity.

So, this brings us to the final and most important question: **What must we do to have the Holy Spirit come down upon us?**  

The first clue comes from today’s Gospel reading, where Jesus says, *"If you love Me, keep My commandments."* This is the prerequisite. If we do not strive to live according to Christ’s commandments—if we do not seek to live selflessly, avoid serving mammon, keep our hearts clean, and strive to live by the Gospel—we cannot expect to receive the Holy Spirit. Without this foundation, the Holy Spirit will not dwell within us.  

However, there is another crucial point: **we cannot force the Holy Spirit to come down upon us.** It is not a mechanical process, like following a set of steps (A, B, C) to achieve a result. It is not like yoga, fitness, or any human effort where we control the outcome. The Holy Spirit is God Himself, and He breathes wherever He wills. He comes when He decides to come.  

Our role, then, is to **prepare the vessel of our heart** for the Holy Spirit. We know that the Holy Spirit can come, but if our hearts are not ready, His presence will have no place to dwell. Our task is to make this our priority—our main goal. We must prepare our hearts and pray eagerly for the Holy Spirit to come.  

Yet, how often do we truly pray for the Holy Spirit? How many of us cry out day and night, asking the Lord to send the Holy Spirit into our lives? Sadly, even among Christians, this is rare. We often pray for specific needs—to solve problems, to receive help, or to achieve certain goals—but we neglect to pray for the Holy Spirit Himself.  

We must understand that **without the Holy Spirit, we can do nothing.** Without the Comforter, we lack the strength, courage, and guidance to serve the Lord. Without Him, we cannot truly be Christians.  

Therefore, our goal and priority must be twofold:  
1. **Prepare the vessel of our heart** by living according to Christ’s commandments and keeping our hearts clean.  
2. **Pray fervently and persistently** for the Holy Spirit to come upon us.  

When we do this, the Holy Spirit will come. And when He does, we must respond with **great gratitude**, thanking the Lord for His presence in our lives. We must treasure this gift and live in the Holy Spirit throughout the year—not just during Pentecost.  

Pentecost is not merely a celebration or a liturgical event. It is the fulfillment of Christ’s resurrection and the goal He set for His disciples: to receive the Holy Spirit and continue His mission in the world. This is our task as well.  

Finally, it is important to recognize that in our secular lives, we often replace the Holy Spirit with **money**. When faced with problems, we think, *"If I had money, I could solve this."* Money becomes a substitute for grace. This is why Jesus warned us, *"You cannot serve both God and mammon."* Mammon may masquerade as a god, but it will always remain mammon—a false and empty substitute for the true grace and power of the Holy Spirit.  

May the Lord help us to prepare our hearts, to pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit, and to live in His grace and power every day. Amen.

We see a great danger in seeking substitutes for the Holy Spirit and the grace of God. In our lives, we often fill the void with things that promise comfort and relief but ultimately fail to deliver. Some seek solace in material possessions, others in constant travel or experiences, and still others turn to drugs, alcohol, or other destructive behaviors. These are all attempts to find relief and comfort—**false comforters**—that cannot satisfy the deepest longings of our souls.  

This pursuit of counterfeit comfort is not only futile but also deadly. It distracts us from the true source of peace and fulfillment: **God and the Holy Spirit.** The Holy Spirit alone can provide the genuine comfort and relief we seek. When we live in Him and with Him, He solves our problems, heals our wounds, and fills us with His peace.  

Let us not be deceived by the tricks of the devil or the empty promises of the world. The true Comforter is the Holy Spirit, and He is the only one who can bring us the relief and peace we long for.  

May the Lord guide us, grant us His grace, and protect us from all deception. May we be His faithful and courageous witnesses, relying on the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and walking in humility. As Jesus said, *"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."* When we empty ourselves of our own pride and self-reliance, we become vessels ready to receive the Holy Spirit.  

Let us strive to be poor in spirit, humble, and open to the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. May the Lord bless you all, and may you have a blessed and joyful Pentecost. Amen.
