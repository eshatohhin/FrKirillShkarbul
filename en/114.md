# How to know if I’m “in Christ” on daily basis

Dear brothers and sisters, what does it mean to be in Christ? To communicate with Christ? To be united with God? This is the goal of our Christian life, but very often we lack such experiences. It becomes mere words, nothing more. We read in Paul's letters where he says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me." And very often, he emphasizes, "You can do this or that, but in Christ." What does this mean? Is it just nice words? For Paul, it was a very concrete and clear experience. We sometimes think, "Well, that's for prophets, visionaries, or mystics." Today, I will not talk about mysticism or rare experiences. Instead, I want to discuss the experience that we, as Christians, should cultivate daily. This experience will strengthen our faith, because our goal is to trust faithfully in the Lord.

But if we don't... Suppose we have a contract with someone, but we don't hear from the other party for many years. Do we still trust that person? Usually, no. Similarly, when we think, "Well, God is somewhere out there. I hope I can attain salvation one day, but in my daily life, it's just me. I'm struggling, and hopefully, He can help me with some projects I undertake." But essentially, it's just me, running around like everyone else. So, my religious life is merely a matter of belonging. Yes, I am Orthodox; I am Christian, and this is my status. But these are my beliefs. Faith is not merely believing that Christ is the Savior. Faith is trusting in Him, entrusting Him with my entire life. To entrust everything I do and to act according to His commandments in every single choice I make requires great trust in Him, because it often goes against human logic.

If we truly want to grow in faith, we must have this daily experience with Christ, in a relationship with Him. And we must guard against pride. This is the greatest concern. Why don't we see more miracles or signs of the Lord's presence in our lives? It is because we are too proud. We think, "I'm so special. If the Lord is acting in my life, I must be very special, better than others." This is false. The sun shines on everyone. Are you proud that the sun is shining on you today? Of course not. In the same way, if we feel God's presence in our lives, it does not mean we are exceptionally good. So, let us discuss what signs we can look for to reinforce our faith day by day.

First, there are the experiences of Christians who believe in Christ but feel no sense of God's presence in their lives. For example, I once visited Papua New Guinea, where a large number of people—over a thousand—decided to become Orthodox. When I spoke with them to understand why, they said, "We go to church, the Catholic Church, every day, every Sunday. We do everything we are supposed to do: Confession, Communion, reading the Bible, praying. But nothing changes. We still have all those bad habits. We still quarrel, accuse each other, suffer from depression, and need to eat this bitter nut to feel excited. In fact, we are worse than people outside the church, those who are not Christians. So why bother?" They discovered the presence of Christ when they became Orthodox.

Another example comes from my visits to a schismatic church in Ukraine. It felt like a museum; you didn't sense God's presence there. It was just stones. There is also a false sense of God's presence in some modern Charismatic practices, which are popular. People gather, scream, shake, jump, play loud music, shout "Hallelujah," and engage in other forms of emotional expression.

And then, yes, now I feel it, I feel it, yes. Well, you could take anyone off the street, bring them to such a gathering, and they would feel the same stirred-up emotions. But this has nothing to do with Christ or the Holy Spirit. It is purely a man-made emotional explosion, mixed with romanticism. Everyone is romantic, feeling Christ as a "husband," but this is a very different spirit, and it is not spiritually healthy. Today, I want to talk about healthy spirituality and distinguish at least six aspects that can show us whether, on a daily basis, we are growing closer to Christ.

The first aspect is the healing power of the resurrection entering our hearts. This is most evident when we partake in Holy Communion after a sincere confession, repenting of our sins. Then, we feel this healing most profoundly. But even before that, if we are not yet baptized, we can still sense this healing power. When we repent and pray to God, the Lord heals our wounds. Our souls are broken; we carry darkness, sickness, and negative feelings within us. We are unable to do good, and we sense our brokenness in many ways—through addictions, passions we cannot overcome, and other struggles. Yet, when we pray and receive Holy Communion, we feel the Lord healing us. This is already communication with Christ, and we can experience it daily, especially through Holy Communion. We must be attentive to our inner world to perceive this renewal. It makes us new, not through an exchange, but through bringing ourselves to Him—our efforts to follow His commandments, our prayers, and our participation. He heals our souls as we offer ourselves to Him. This is the first aspect.

The second aspect is the enlightenment of our feelings. As we draw closer to Christ, we lose our attachment to worldly things. Normally, when Christ is absent from our lives, we rely on and are attached to five things:  
1. **Food**—we seek good meals, restaurants, and tasty dishes.  
2. **Clothing**—we care about how we look, our comfort, and appearance.  
3. **Housing**—we want a nice, warm, and comfortable home or hotel.  
4. **Relationships**—we fear loneliness and depend on family, friends, and social media for connection.  
5. **Glory**—we crave recognition, status, likes on social media, or any form of worldly approval.  

But when Christ enters our lives, these five worldly attachments are replaced by spiritual realities:  
1. **Food**—Christ becomes our true nourishment. The Word of God feeds our souls, surpassing the importance of earthly food.  
2. **Clothing**—Whoever is baptized in Christ has "put on Christ." His ways adorn us, replacing our craving for worldly attire.  
3. **Housing**—Christ becomes our dwelling place. We find our home in Him, transcending the need for physical comfort.  
4. **Relationships**—Our connection with Christ fulfills our deepest need for companionship, freeing us from the fear of loneliness.  
5. **Glory**—We seek glory not from the world but from God, finding our worth in His approval rather than human recognition.  

This transformation is profound, and while I cannot delve deeply into each point here, it is clear that Christ replaces our worldly dependencies with spiritual fulfillment. This is the second aspect of growing closer to Him.

For us, it becomes most important that our souls dwell in the temple of the Lord. We can feel this, and it becomes what truly matters. Even if we are far away—in Africa, a desert, a forest, or anywhere—we feel the Lord's presence. Our hearts find comfort and dwelling in Him. The more this feeling grows, the less we care about the physical place where we live or worldly comforts. These feelings are transformed.

Our relationships with others also change. We feel that we are never alone. The more we sense Christ's presence, the more assured we become that we are with Him, talking to Him, and communicating with Him. This assurance deepens our connection to Him.

As for glory, Christians receive glory from God, not from people. When we live righteously, in chastity, and according to the Lord's commandments, we feel this glory. It comes because we are drawing closer to the saints, who are in glory. This should not make us proud; instead, we remain humble, feeling worse than everyone else. Yet, we can sense this glory from God, and that is what truly matters.

The third aspect is the enlightenment of our minds by Christ. He is the light of the world, and He enlightens us. How does this happen? We begin to understand things we could not grasp before—moral values, the meaning of prayers, family relationships, and even regular studies. Our minds work better, and we gain wisdom from Christ. This enlightenment is a sign of His presence in our lives.

The fourth aspect is a change in our attitude toward others. The closer we draw to Christ, the less we judge others. We feel their pain more deeply and become kinder, seeing Christ in their faces and lives. We recognize the Lord's image in them—something spiritual and bright. This makes us more respectful, humble, and obedient, especially toward those older than us or in positions of authority. In family and spousal relationships, we become more attentive and less selfish. These changes are signs that the Lord is working in our lives.

The fifth aspect is thinking less about ourselves. When Christ enters our lives, we become less preoccupied with earthly things—our future, career, or how others perceive us. We no longer fear what might happen to us or cling to our time as if it belongs solely to us. Instead, we value dedicating our time to Christ and His ministry. This shift in priorities shows that Christ is changing us, and the seed of His Word is growing in our hearts. When we see Him at work in our lives, we are inspired to serve Him with even greater effort.

Finally, the sixth aspect is increased patience in the face of sorrows and trials. As we grow closer to Christ, we develop greater endurance for life's challenges—pain, sickness, financial struggles, or any other problems. When someone speaks harshly to us, we are less troubled. This resilience is a sign that the Lord is with us, and we feel His presence more deeply.

These six aspects—healing, enlightenment of feelings and mind, transformed relationships, selflessness, and patience—are signs that we are growing closer to Christ. They show that His presence is real in our lives, not just in words but in daily experience. Let us strive to cultivate these signs, deepening our faith and trust in Him every day.

We can even imagine that He is by our side, experiencing the same difficulties we face. He reinforces us, becoming our friend, our support, our reliance, and our rock. This becomes a reality in our lives. These are the truths I want to emphasize.

We can also see the Lord's answers in the events of our lives. This may not happen daily, but perhaps every few months or during special situations when we seek His guidance. When something happens, we should not dismiss it as mere coincidence. Instead, we should recognize it as the Lord answering our prayers and speaking to our hearts. He is giving us these signs, and we should be thankful for them. This ongoing dialogue with Him strengthens our faith and deepens our relationship with Him.

Let us remember these things. Let us strive to feel the Lord's presence every day. Pray for His presence and maintain this communication with Him, allowing it to reinforce our faith. Through these experiences, we see His responses, and we become willing to do even more for Him. Our faith grows stronger, and we are prepared to walk on the waters, just as the Apostle Peter did. With the Lord's help and His blessing, we will walk on the waters. Amen.
