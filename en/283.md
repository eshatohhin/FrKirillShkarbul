# Why evil does not exist, but it is harming us..

Dear brothers and sisters, there is an old question about "What is evil?" Today, we will try to change the way we look at evil and see who is evil and what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.

We see that we live in a world that is modern Babylon. There is so much evil out there; if you just read the news, it's all evil—there is almost nothing good happening. And of course, if you're a Christian and trying to live a spiritual life, you will see how much evil there is in the way people live within ourselves. There is so much passion and evil; it's all over. Sometimes it even seems that it's not God who is ruling the world, but the devil. Because all these people with power and influence—they are all, I don't know, Masons or some Satanists, occultists—from what is propagated through the media, through this pseudo-culture, it's all evil.

Some people are hoping that the right wing will bring something better, but this is just games. In any case, there is the idea that evil and good are compensating for each other. This is a very ancient pagan idea, and also the Kabbalists and the occultists have this idea that there is no evil, that the so-called evil is just a flip of good. Kabbalists even say that we need to be very evil in order to become good, to have something good come out of it. This is a very ancient thing—Chinese yin and yang, light and darkness, cold and hot—the world is balanced; it needs to be balanced, so there is something good and something evil.

Even within scholasticism, supposedly Christian theology, they say that evil is just a lack of good. Well, this is partly right, but whatever is partly right is wrong. So let us today talk about what the Bible says and how we look at all these things through the eyes of the Bible.

In Job 34:12, the original here is a question because the King James translates it as a statement, but I will just translate it myself: "Do you think that God would do improper things?" This word in the King James is translated as "wicked." The Greek original here is *atopa*, and this is a very important concept; we see it quite a few times in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. *Atopa* sounds similar to the English word "utopia," and it actually has the same structure.

"U" means "no," and "topia" comes from "topos," which means "place." So, "utopia" refers to a fantastic, ideal world that doesn't exist and cannot exist. It is just imagination, fantasy, fake, and delusion. This is why the devil is a master of dreams—he sends you all kinds of dreams and imaginations, making you believe how bright something will be if you do this or that. Similarly, "atopa" also comes from "a" (no) and "topos" (place), meaning things that have no place. It can be translated as "improper," but "improper" is a very soft word. It means something that has no ground, no place for it. Whatever is created by God, whatever is blessed by God, has its place. God has placed His blessing upon this or that. But some things don't have to be blessed, and these are the things that are *atopa*—they don't have their place to fall into. That is why it is talking about evil, about sin—lawlessness, vanity. "Vanity" is a very good word in English because these words in Hebrew come from the word *shaf*, which means "empty." It is empty. Sometimes we say an "empty person." Whatever is against the will of God doesn't have true existence. This is a little philosophical, but bear with me for a second.

God is absolute goodness, and whatever He created is good. He created this, looked at it, and said, "This is good." Things are good. So, whatever comes from God is good and is related to Him directly, somehow. That's why it exists—it exists insofar as it is related to God. This is a little philosophical, but I think it is not so difficult to understand. Our minds think differently. We think, "Okay, this exists; I can touch it." For example, a pen. I can touch this pen, so it exists; it is real. But for the Lord, it is not like that. If something has meaning for Him, if it has any goodness in it, then it exists. As long as it doesn't, it is *atopa*—it has no place. So, when God's spirit is withdrawn from something, it decays, dies, and perishes. We talked about *Avadon* in a few videos ago—something that doesn't have God's blessing or presence. It is destruction, desolation, vanity, emptiness.

We can talk about things that are against God's will. Think of it this way: we have things that exist because they are related to God; they bear His blessing. And there are things that are out there but don't truly have existence. God hates these things. This comes from Psalm 45:7: "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity" (or lawlessness). It's the same as *atopa*. The Lord hates; He has a strong aversion to such things. These things are out there—I'm not saying they're absent. They're there. We have this Babylon out there, and here also, in every one of us. We should remember that. Now, the Lord creates a *gar*, a fence, to protect what is good. This fence, or *gar*, is called the law of God—the commandments. They are there to protect what exists from what does not exist, from what is *Avadon*—corruption, destruction, filthiness, death, suffering, pain. Whenever we break the law of God, we fall into this thing. That's why when someone wants unlimited freedoms, it means they want to live in *Avadon*, and that means death. They become an instrument of the devil.

Now, we come to an important question: Can we have *atopa* people? Can we have people who are *atopi* (in Greek), who have no place for existence? To talk about this, first, let's think about things. Can we have *atopa* things? Well,

Let's say we have a stone. The stone is created by God, so it has goodness in it. It exists; it has its existence. Now, if we use this stone to kill people—if we make an axe or a hammer and use it solely for the purpose of killing people—this thing becomes *atopa*. It becomes *atopon*. Of course, when we cease using it, say 300 years later, and we find this axe in a museum, it is no longer *atopon*. It becomes an artifact, an exponent of the civilization that lived back then. It is no longer *atopon*, but it speaks of the *atopa* things that were done by the people of that time. So, a thing can go back and forth—it can become *atopon* and then return to something that has meaning, usefulness, and a reason for existence. We can even use it for good purposes, like building a house or something else.

Now, people—this is serious—are created according to the image of the Lord. Can we say that people who are sinners, or evil, bad sinners, can they become *atopy*? Well, let's see what the Bible tells us. In 2 Thessalonians 3:2, it says, "Brethren, pray for us, that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, for not all men have faith." Here, the word "unreasonable" in Greek is *atopon*, and "wicked" is *poniros*. This refers to people of vanity, people of desolation, people of *Avadon*, if you will. They pretend to be brethren, but they don't have faith. They are like brethren, but they lack faith. This brings us to a very important conclusion: people can become *atopon*, *atopy*. They can become an abomination in the eyes of the Lord.

In the Psalms, we see verses that say such people will be scattered like smoke, or that the men of blood and delusion will not live half their days—they will die young. Of course, sometimes they live for a long time, but that's another question. Nevertheless, there are people who become like that. It's worse than just being a sinner. It's a sinner who deliberately chooses sin as a rebellion against God. For example, heresy is deliberately choosing to be against God and standing firm on that position, unwilling to repent. It's similar with other kinds of sinners—people who love to hurt others and enjoy it. It's not that they got angry, said something rude, and then repented, saying, "Well, it's not bad; there was too much. Next time, I'll try to do better." No, they wait for the next chance to do the same, and even more. When sin becomes our second nature, and we find pleasure—this satanic pleasure—in sin, and we choose to stay that way, that's when we slip into this *atopon*. 

Whenever you feel that you are in that state, or you see others in that state, it is essentially an abomination in the eyes of the Lord. In Job, we also see that he knows about these things, but he doesn't want to acknowledge them because he hates them. He looks upon them but doesn't want to see them because he knows everything, yet he doesn't want to know because it's against his will. It's an abomination in his eyes. That's vanity; that's decomposition. It is something that is heading toward destruction.

Now, the question arises: Men are created by God. How can they become *atopon*? The answer lies in their choices. When people deliberately choose to rebel against God, embrace sin, and refuse to repent, they distance themselves from God's blessing and presence. They become like the *atopa* things—things that have no place in God's order. They exist, but their existence is marked by emptiness, vanity, and destruction. This is a sobering reminder of the importance of aligning our lives with God's will and seeking His grace to avoid falling into such a state.

The same way Satan was created by God, there is always, for example, for Satan or for these *atopon* people, a great tension. Satan's existence is a paradox—he exists, and he will exist forever, just as the souls of those who belong to hell, to *Avadon*, will endure eternal condemnation. The greatest pain and suffering for Satan comes from his understanding that his existence is thanks to God. He has to be thankful to God for his own existence, yet he is in rebellion against God and wishes for God to disappear. This creates an unbearable tension within him, which is why he is so restless, nervous, and filled with worry. This tension is also why we see so much depression, anxiety, and mental disorders in the world—not the inborn ones, but those developed as people live in this world of Babylon.

For Christians who choose goodness and God, we should not give too much respect or weight to the things of *Avadon*, treating them as if they are an objective, serious threat. Yes, they can harm us—they even harmed Jesus Himself, as He was killed by such forces. But Jesus was never afraid of them. He was cautious, and He warned His disciples, "Be cautious of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues, and some of you will be killed." Yet, He also assured them that they need not fear such things. Let us not be empty; let us rid ourselves of any evil that may still linger in our hearts or lives—anything that belongs to the realm of darkness, of *Avadon*.

The problem with sin is that even if we repent, we are not yet in *Avadon*, but every time we sin, we are sliding in that direction. For example, you sin, you repent; you sin again, you repent again; then you sin even more, and perhaps next time you say, "Forget it, I'm like this," and you slip into *Avadon*. Your conscience becomes destroyed, and you begin to enjoy being separated from God, annihilated from His presence. This is where much of the world finds itself at this moment. Yet, the Lord waits, just as the stone or the axe can return to being blessed, so too can a person return to God. In fact, a person can return even faster, because that is what we are created for—to be with God, not to be in *Avadon*. There is always hope, at least for us, and the Lord also hopes. But He knows more, and at some point, there is a cutting edge where He will say, "No hope anymore." May we avoid such a destiny, and may we have compassion for those who are on that path.

There is even a saint, I believe it was Saint Simeon, who said that we should have compassion even toward the devil. He chose the wrong path and slipped into misery, but he could have had something far greater than what he has now. Let us have humility, love for our Lord, and love for life. Let us draw from the source of life and never slip into the path of *Avadon* or even come close to it. May the Lord bless us, and may Jesus Christ, who is life Himself, live in each of us. Where there is life, there is no death, no corruption, no destruction, no delusion, and no faithlessness. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
