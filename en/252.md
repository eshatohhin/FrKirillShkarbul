# Annunciation overthrows the serpent

Dear brothers and sisters, we celebrate the Annunciation of the Most Holy Theotokos.  
This is a very bright and joyful feast, one of such profound importance that we often fail to grasp its full significance.  
This feast commemorates the Lord's incarnation, His coming into this world.  
It is the mystery of piety, as the Apostle Paul speaks of in his epistles—a mystery that lies at the very heart of why this world exists.  
This event forms the foundation of all world history, from the beginning of creation to its ultimate fulfillment.  
It is all about the Lord's coming into this world to save us, so that every human being, in their fallen state, may be brought to perfection and restored to the likeness of the Lord.  
This divine mission overthrows all evil and dispels the darkness of this world.  

Yet, darkness still abounds, which is why we must delve deeply into the study of this world. In the following videos, I will explore the topic of Revelation as it unfolds in our world today, along with the prophecies contained within it.  
The book of Genesis, as the first book of the Bible, and the book of Revelation are intricately connected—they are keys to understanding one another. By examining Genesis, we can gain profound insights into the mysteries of Revelation.  

First, let us turn to the event of the Annunciation, as described in Luke 1:26–38. If you are unfamiliar with this passage or wish to refresh your memory, this is where you will find it.  
Now, we will turn our attention to Genesis, for it is essential to understand how this event relates to the serpent and the deception orchestrated by the devil.  

In Genesis 3:15, we read that the Lord speaks to the serpent, the devil:  
"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."  
The Holy Fathers have explained to us that the "seed of the woman" refers to the offspring of a female—specifically, the Theotokos, the Ever-Virgin Mary.  
This seed, her offspring, will crush the head of the serpent.  
In the Bible, genealogies typically trace lineage through the male line, as it is the seed of a man that gives birth to his descendants.  
However, here we read of the "seed of a woman," a clear reference to the Theotokos and the mystery of the Annunciation.  
While this passage holds multiple meanings, today we will focus on the truth that the Lord will come and crush the head of the serpent.  

This is echoed in Revelation, where we read of the beast rising from the sea, one of whose heads bears a wound.  
This wound signifies that the beast was struck by the coming of the Lord into this world.  

Regarding this serpent, let us turn to the prophet Isaiah, chapter 27, verse 1:  
"In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan, the piercing serpent, even leviathan, that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea."  
Here, the serpent, leviathan, and the dragon in the sea are all symbolic representations of the devil.  
The "sore sword" mentioned refers to the coming of the Lord, His incarnation, which breaks through the heavens and shatters the protection that leviathan, the serpent, once held.  

This is the profound mystery we celebrate today—the Annunciation, the beginning of the Lord's work to overthrow the powers of darkness and bring salvation to all humanity.

Before we delve into the concept of the heavens being closed and what this means in our world, let us also consider what the book of Job has to say. In Job 41:15–17, we read about the skin, or the scales, of leviathan:  
"His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. One is so near to another that no air can come between them. They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered."  
No man can separate these scales or pierce them with any weapon. This is the spiritual warfare we are engaged in today, particularly in this great land. Only the Lord is capable of crushing the head of leviathan and piercing through its impenetrable scales.  

What, then, are the scales of leviathan? They represent sinners—people bound together by their sins. When individuals share in common sin, they become glued to one another, united in their wrongdoing.  
This phenomenon can be observed in various systems and structures. For example, consider a bureaucratic system devoid of humanity, where individuals merely follow instructions, protocols, and algorithms. These systems operate without conscience, with everyone covering for one another.  
You can find this dynamic in a mafia, where members protect each other; in organizations where sin has taken root, with people shielding one another; or even in nationalism, revolutions, and armies. In such groups, individuals are so tightly bound together that no one can break free. They march in unison, so closely connected that even air cannot penetrate.  

The "air" that cannot penetrate symbolizes truth—when you preach repentance or present reasoned arguments, they remain unmoved. Their conscience is silenced, replaced by a single protocol or system. Their shared sin and passions hold them captive, blocking their view of heaven. Truth cannot reach them; only the Lord's grace can break through this barrier.  

We must also recognize that leviathan is not merely an external force—it resides within each of us. This is the dangerous and frightening reality. To overcome leviathan, we must first confront and destroy it within ourselves. This begins by putting an end to our passions and bad habits, allowing the Lord's grace to work within us and break the bonds of sin.

So, what examples do we find of the power of Leviathan at work in this world? One clear manifestation is the widespread refusal to believe in Christ. Many people are unwilling to listen to the message of Christ, repentance, self-sacrifice, or virtues. Instead, they are bound to other ideologies—whether New Age spirituality, atheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, or something else. They are blinded by sin and deception, which dominate their communities.  

Others, who may not care about religion at all, serve mammon instead. They dedicate their lives to money, pleasure, career, self-satisfaction, and countless other worldly pursuits. For them, heaven is whatever they crave in this life—wealth, power, or comfort. The true heaven is blocked from their sight, just as it was for those who killed Christ: the Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, and high priests.  

These individuals believed in the same God, followed the same Bible, prayed, and kept the commandments. Yet, they became enemies of God and killed Jesus Christ. They rejected the true Messiah and instead sought an Antichrist. This is a sobering reminder that even those who claim to believe in God can become servants of mammon. Tragically, this is the reality for many of us, even among the faithful who attend church and pray.  

A common struggle among believers is despondency—losing trust in the Lord, feeling that He will not help us, and despairing about ourselves and the world. This is spiritual suicide, as it involves listening to the devil's slander about God. When we succumb to this, we become slaves of Leviathan, and the heavens are blocked from us.  

Turning to Catholicism and Protestantism, we see how Leviathan has achieved great success in blocking the heavens for many. In Catholicism, the focus on the Pope often overshadows the need to listen to the Holy Spirit and follow Jesus Christ. This was evident during the Crusades, when Catholics killed countless innocent people, including Christians, and destroyed the Byzantine Empire, a great Christian civilization. The spirit of the Antichrist drove these actions. Additionally, Catholic spirituality, with its emphasis on fantasies and scholastic theories about God, can block the true Lord from being known.  

In Protestantism, the situation has become even more dire. Protestants often teach that heaven is distant and inaccessible, as they reject sacraments, the presence of God in the world, and the transformative power of grace. For them, there are no saints, no Divine Liturgy, no holy icons, no relics, no holy water, no consecration, no priests, and no need for monasticism or ascetic life. Instead, they emphasize earthly concerns: building hospitals, schools, and businesses. The Protestant work ethic glorifies worldly success, with the belief that one is already saved and need only focus on this life.  

This mindset has fueled the rise of modern Babylon, with its worship of mammon, particularly in Protestant nations like the United Kingdom and the United States. The emphasis on business, bourgeois revolutions, the overthrow of monarchies, and the industrial revolution all reflect this shift away from heavenly concerns to earthly pursuits.  

In summary, the power of Leviathan is evident in the rejection of Christ, the pursuit of mammon, and the distortions of faith found in various religious traditions. To overcome this, we must turn away from sin, reject the deceptions of the devil, and seek the true heaven through repentance, faith, and a life dedicated to God.

Capitalism and socialism, both originating in these Protestant-influenced nations, expanded globally, shaping the modern world. What we see today is the rise of Leviathan, this new Babylon, seeking to conquer the entire world. I will delve deeper into the topics of Babylon and the beast in future discussions, but for now, it is crucial for us to recognize our task: to seek the true heaven and crave its righteousness.  

As the Lord said, "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" (Matthew 6:33). During this Great Lent, we are called to repent deeply, acknowledging how far we remain from the heavens. We must recognize our spiritual sickness and fallen state, understanding that there is still so much work to be done. Only when we grasp this truth can we pray with tears of repentance, pleading for the Lord's salvation and grace to descend upon us.  

We ask for His grace to enlighten our minds, heal our hearts, and teach us to pray. May the Lord's grace humble each of us, reminding us of our dependence on Him. We are eternally grateful to His Mother, the Most Holy Theotokos, who, through her acceptance of God's will and her willingness to endure any suffering, became the Mother of the Messiah—the One who crushes the serpent's head.  

May the Lord's power, wisdom, strength, and piety be with every one of us. Amen.  

Congratulations, brothers and sisters, on this joyful Feast of the Annunciation. Amen.
