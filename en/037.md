# How holy things may lead us astray.

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about what we can do to fight in this spiritual war that is ongoing, and now we see it is getting worse. This situation is indeed worsening. We are receiving very strong blows. Just today, I received a message listing all the priests who have died from this pandemic. The devil is trying to intimidate the church by causing so many deaths. He wants us to live in fear so that he can implement his future plans. But we must withstand this fear. We are not afraid of anything. By faith, we are aware of the dangers of this pandemic, but we are not afraid of it or of the devil. We will remain strong in spirit and overcome all the challenges that come our way.

We see a significant blow coming with the attempted split within the Orthodox Church. This is another major impact of the devil's attack on the church and represents an important crisis. In these times of war and turmoil within the church, we need to understand that the Lord is allowing this to happen due to the spiritual problems we have within the church. This is the main reason we are facing these blows and injuries. We need to strengthen our faith—each one of us and the entire church. Everyone can make a significant and important contribution to overcoming these challenges and becoming even stronger.

Today, I want to address the problem of relying too much on sacrificial and holy objects, rites, rituals, and other things. In the past, I have spoken about an even bigger issue: the lack of faith and lack of interest in spiritual life. Being spiritually lazy, idle, and lukewarm is a significant problem. As Christ tells the churches, if you are lukewarm and do not become fervent, I will remove you from your place, and you will lose everything. This is a major issue we face. Many people do not care about spiritual life or prayer. They are unwilling to put effort into fasting, reading the Gospel, or engaging in spiritual life. This is the most significant problem we have.

Another issue is that when we decide to be spiritually active, we might receive wrong guidance or follow wrong examples. Our efforts may be misdirected, leading to failure. Many people fall into this trap, influenced by paganism that still lingers within us. Everyone was a pagan at some point, worshipping idols. This stems from humanity's loss of God after Adam lost paradise. There is a deep craving to reconnect with God, and this nostalgia is often realized through holy objects. People feel a connection to God through these objects, but the problem is that this pagan mindset persists. We begin to think these objects are crucial and place too much emphasis on them—holy oil, holy ropes, or other items from monasteries. We believe that by possessing these objects, we control God's grace. This is a significant issue that can lead our relationship with God astray.

What the Lord truly desires is a change of heart through faith. This means that every day, our faith should transform our lives in some way. We should strive to follow Christ, changing how we live and what we do.

To get rid of bad habits and passions, to pray more, we must force ourselves and exert effort. This is what is precious to the Lord. There is nothing wrong, of course, with having icons, crosses, and other holy objects, or with going on pilgrimages to holy places—as long as we maintain balance and set our priorities correctly. The highest priority for us should not be to touch as many holy objects as possible, hang as many holy items as we can, or light as many candles as we can. The most important thing is to change ourselves, as I have said.

I want to read from the epistle of the holy apostle Paul to the Hebrews, chapter 11, verse 33. This passage provides examples of what people accomplished by faith and what God expects us to do by faith. These individuals, through faith, subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, and out of weakness were made strong. They became valiant in battle, turned foreign armies to flight, and women received their dead back to life. Others were tortured, refusing deliverance so that they might obtain a better resurrection. Some endured cruel mockings, scourgings, bonds, and imprisonment. They were stoned, sawn asunder, tempted, and slain with the sword. They wandered in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, afflicted, and tormented—people of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, mountains, dens, and caves of the earth. All these, having obtained a good report through faith, received God’s approval. They passed the test.

This is what we need to see. We often think, "I cannot do this or that; I am so limited in my abilities." Yet, by faith, these individuals subdued kingdoms and even chased away armies of aliens—not by power, money, or influence, but by faith. Faith is the greatest power because, through faith, God is with us and accomplishes His work. This is what we must value most.

In the early Christian church, believers did not hang crosses outside their homes or wear special clothing to show they were Christians. Yet, everyone knew they were Christians because their hearts were full of love, their lives were different, and their faith shone from their faces. Today, however, many Christians have become hypocrites. We try to show that we are Christians by displaying holy objects or visiting holy places, using these as proof of our faith. Yet, inside, we may be completely different. This is hypocrisy—when we do not have Christ living in us but try to convince others that we are Christians. This is a significant problem within the church, and we must address it daily.

On a daily basis, we must exert effort and ask ourselves, "What have I done by faith today? Have I forgiven an enemy? Have I served others at work with love? Have I done something by faith today?" If not, we must go and do it. May God help you and give you the power of faith. We always have this task: to strengthen our faith, to have a burning heart full of faith. We are not merely squeezing this faith out of ourselves; we are asking the Lord to grant it to us as a gift.

and I am doing everything possible to please my Lord and to testify to His love to everyone around me. May the Lord help you and give you this eagerness, this bravery, to go and change everything around you by faith, to become stronger, and thereby strengthen the entire church. May the Lord help you and bless you. Amen.
