# ARRIVAL of the Beast： Only Repentance can save us!

Dear brothers and sisters, this week and this coming Sunday we celebrate Saint Mary of Egypt, the great saint who showed us what true repentance means—what it means to completely forsake all sins, all passions, everything belonging to this world, and to dedicate herself totally and without reservation to Christ.  

This great saint is a mystery to us in many ways; there is much we do not understand about her. But what we do understand is that she had a strong will—a strong will to completely cut off her past life and begin anew. Today, I want to share with you about repentance: what it is and, practically, how to discern whether we are in repentance. This is what the Lord calls us to—true prayer is true repentance. To pray unceasingly means to repent unceasingly, to have the fear of God unceasingly at every moment of your life.  

I also want to share a few thoughts about what is happening in the world generally. Of course, this is a vast topic, but I will only make a few points—and these two subjects are related. They are connected because when we repent, our perspective often shifts from the external to the internal.  

Of course, there are many ways to live in sin, in apostasy, in delusion—but the most common is to direct oneself toward external things. What do I mean by that? I mean perceiving this world as an external threat. For example, whenever conflict arises at home, or you encounter a problem with another person or a situation, the last thing you consider is that you yourself might be at fault.  

We see other examples as well. We observe the weather and say, "I feel bad—maybe because of the weather, or because I ate something wrong, or because of some other external factor." We always seek external causes for our discomfort. Even when we experience something internally, we treat it as an external phenomenon—an experience outside ourselves. We do not trace its root to our own faults, our spiritual failings, our betrayal of Christ, our vainglory, or our selfishness. No, this is the last thing we consider.  

This is a sign that there is no repentance in us—no self-reflection. We are unable to look upon ourselves with the eyes of the Lord, as He would see us. The voice of conscience we once had, perhaps in our youth, grows weaker and weaker. We no longer hear it clearly. Instead, we think, "I shouldn’t do this because others will judge me," or, "If I do this, I might betray my own principles." And if we fail, we simply accept defeat rather than examining our hearts.

We can clearly see this spirit in every heresy. We see it in the Catholic heresy—this is why it is so difficult for a Catholic to acknowledge his own faults, because he instinctively believes everyone else is guilty. I have encountered this many times: when there is a family conflict and one side is Catholic, that person will always insist on being right. Of course, this is not exclusive to Catholics, but it is especially pronounced among them. And it has grown even worse with the Protestants—with their heresy—because there, everyone has become his own pope. Essentially, this is the deification of man, replacing God with oneself as an idol.  

Repentance is about crushing this idol. Think deeply about this, brothers and sisters, because it is the only way for us to escape deception. If this truth does not live in us, we will fall victim to some delusion—and there are countless ways to deceive people. Now, with so many heretics long deceived, even some Orthodox are being led astray. Even some pastors are following the prince of this world, helping to build his kingdom of the Antichrist, all while believing they serve God and remain faithful Orthodox Christians.  

We are living in a time of great challenge and testing. The Lord is testing us—these are the days when trials will come upon the whole world. These trials will reveal who truly loves God, who is willing to sacrifice himself completely and without reservation for Him. This is the path Saint Mary of Egypt has shown us. And so, I want to make clear the connection between these two topics: repentance and what is happening in the world today.  

One last thing about repentance: there is a saint, Saint John Kolobos, an ascetic who lived in Egypt for many decades and wrote extensively on the principles of asceticism and repentance. He gives us a parable—  

There was a harlot, much like Mary of Egypt in her former life. She was deeply entangled in sin, even demonically driven, engaging in fornication not just for money but for pleasure. One day, a prince—though she did not know he was a prince—a noble, virtuous, chaste, and pure man, came to her with an offer: *If you promise to cut off all your sinful relationships, if you forsake fornication, I will take you as my bride. Though I am clean and you are defiled, I am willing to accept you as you are.*  

She agreed. She went to live in his house. But every evening, the same depraved men would come to her, saying, *Come with us! We know who you are—don’t pretend to be holy. Let’s go back to our old ways.* Yet, though they came every night, she refused them all and remained faithful to her husband.  

Saint John Kolobos explains: *This is our soul.* Our soul is that harlot who has repented. The noble bridegroom is Christ Himself. Now, the soul has a choice—to remain loyal to Christ, to live in holiness, purity, and virtue—or to return to the filth, corruption, and slavery of sin, which leads only to perdition and hell.  

This is the choice before us every day. Let us choose repentance. Let us choose Christ.

Here is the choice before us, brothers and sisters—the same choice Saint Mary of Egypt made. She did not waver back and forth as we often do. Let us be honest with ourselves—this is what true repentance looks like.  

Let us reflect deeply on these things. Let us labor in long prayers—this morning we had a five-hour prayer service. Let us embrace such spiritual labor, let us abide in repentance and humility. This is what will guard us from deception.  

Now, concerning the great deception sweeping the world—seeking to draw all humanity, even Christians, into its web—I speak particularly of Orthodox Christians, for the saints called heretics "anti-Christians." This is the traditional language of the Church. If you have not yet repented and departed from false organizations or sects that falsely call themselves Christian, I urge you—do so now, before it is too late.  

This deception operates through two paradigms, two models established by the prince of this world—Satan, the spirit of antichrist. The first is the Harlot of Babylon: liberalism, anarchism, unrestrained commerce where everything is bought and sold—capitalism in its most corrupt form. The second is Leviathan, the Beast: totalitarianism, fascism, dictatorship, war—all forms of oppressive control.  

These two forces are not truly opposed to one another. At times they pretend to fight, but this is merely theater. In truth, they work together, as Revelation shows—the Harlot rides the Beast. Leviathan is depicted as a monstrous serpent or crocodile lurking in the waters, suddenly emerging to devour, then vanishing again. Meanwhile, the Harlot of Babylon maintains order in his absence.  

This is the simplified but essential reality of our world. While both forces have always existed, in recent times the illusion of "freedom" under democracy, free trade, and liberal values has dominated. But now we see the Beast reawakening—totalitarian control rising openly. The masks are coming off.  

Brothers and sisters, we must not be deceived. The only safety is in Christ—through repentance, prayer, and unwavering faithfulness to His Church. The world offers only slavery disguised as freedom, or tyranny disguised as order. But the Kingdom of God is neither—it is truth, and life, and the only path to salvation. Let us choose it with all our hearts.

We are witnessing the unmasking of Leviathan—the externalization of evil, the open manifestation of the kingdom of the prince of this world. No longer content to rule from shadows, this spirit now demands open worship, absolute submission: "You will know I am your king."  

The transition began in 2020—the first global test of obedience. Then came 2022's war, designed to eradicate the last remnants of Orthodox civilization. Though Russia has largely betrayed Christ, faithful remnants remain in her Church—and these must be eliminated. This is spiritual warfare disguised as geopolitics.  

Now comes the final unmasking: the so-called "free world" will shed its democratic pretense. The theater of elections and liberties concludes. What was always oligarchy will reveal itself as outright tyranny. Do not mistake this for mere political shifts—whether Trump, Biden, or other figureheads. The architects matter less than the spirit driving them—a voracious intelligence using liberals and dictators, bankers and degenerates as interchangeable tools.  

Revelation warns the Antichrist will receive global authority because masses will choose deception. This is why Leviathan emerges now—humanity is ripe for slavery. The spirit of Antichrist advances wherever passions rule: in our anger, our lusts, our compromises. You may oppose politicians yet still serve this spirit through unrepentant sin.  

Only one fortress remains: crucifying our passions through daily repentance. Not institutional allegiance, but personal fidelity to Christ—as St. Mary of Egypt demonstrated—will preserve us when the Beast demands worship. The war is coming for your soul. Will you be enrolled in the Lamb's Book of Life, or branded with the mark of obedience to darkness? The hour demands decisive holiness.

**Final Call to Spiritual Vigilance**  

This is inevitable, brothers and sisters. Whether layman, priest, bishop, or patriarch—if Christ does not dwell in the depths of your heart, you *will* fall. The great trial foretold in Scripture is now upon the world.  

**Therefore, let us:**  
- **Love prayer**—not empty words, but the long, laborious prayer of the heart.  
- **Cleave to Scripture**—not as scholars, but as starving souls seeking the living Bread.  
- **Embrace hesychasm**—the stillness where God speaks louder than the chaos of the age.  
- **Guard our hearts**—for the spirit of Antichrist seduces not just through tyranny, but through our own passions.  

What is coming will resemble the Soviet Union—but with a far deadlier twist. Under communism, many still *knew* it was a lie. Now, the masses will *love* their chains, celebrating their bondage as freedom. The prison will feel like home.  

Yet for those anchored in Christ, no storm can drown us. The Lord’s promise stands: *"He who endures to the end shall be saved"* (Matthew 24:13).  

**Choose today whom you will serve.** The hour is late, the battle is here—not in some distant future, but now. May God grant us the courage of the martyrs, the wisdom of the saints, and the unshakable love of Mary of Egypt.  

**Hold fast. The King is coming.**  

God bless you all.
