# Who are “the children of disobedience” and how to find “spiritual oasis”

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about the "children of disobedience," what it means that all of us were—and perhaps still are—these children of disobedience, and how we live in a spiritual desert.  

In Apostle Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 2, verse 2, he says: *"In time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience."*  

Paul explains that all of us, every person, used to live in this way. Before Christ's coming, all of humanity—everyone—was among these children of disobedience. We must reflect deeply on this because, even now, we may still be in disobedience to God. In fact, every time we sin, every time we forget to have a repentant heart, we return to being children of disobedience. We follow the will of this evil spirit that is in the air.  

It is important to understand that this spirit is not just some grotesque, hell-dwelling entity that possesses only certain people. This spirit is everywhere. It is in the music we often hear on the radio, in the commercials we listen to, and even in the way people sometimes speak. This spirit brings evil associations, lust, and the desire to acquire things. Advertisements are saturated with this spirit because they aim to entice you to buy, convincing you that their product is superior and indispensable. They distract you, focusing your attention on what to eat, drink, wear, or buy, pulling you away from God and from thoughts of Him.  

Consider how the world preoccupies us: what to do, where to vacation, how to enjoy life, how to earn or save money. These distractions aim to completely divert us from God's path.  

In the time of the Old Testament, saints tell us that everyone was under the influence of this spirit. We might think it was a simpler, more virtuous time when people were closer to nature and less deceitful. However, even then, the situation was dire. All people—pagans and even the Israelites—were under the sway of this evil spirit, the "prince of the air" or "prince of this world." The pagans were entirely consumed by this lifestyle, while the Israelites, though they had the name of God and His law, often strayed from righteousness. Prophets were sent to call them back because they, too, were dragged away by the spirit of this world.  

This spirit is in enmity with God, which is why all of us are called children of disobedience. We disobey God, doing what He hates, yet we find pleasure in it. Our will opposes His, leading us in a different direction. It is easy and quick for us to be drawn into this unless we are spiritually trained, vigilant, and steadfast in walking the right path.  

This is why Christ emphasizes vigilance: *"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation"* (Matthew 26:41). Temptation and the sin that follows seize us the moment we lose sight of the true direction. If we truly wish to follow Christ, we must remain aware of this. We cannot afford to relax or wander aimlessly. As Apostle Paul says, we must *"run the race"* (1 Corinthians 9:24). If we run—if we walk purposefully in the right direction—it becomes harder to be dragged away. But if we idle or wander, it is much easier to lose our way.  

Let us, therefore, strive to remain vigilant, focused, and steadfast in our walk with Christ, resisting the pull of the spirit of this world.

Where am I going? This is a crucial question, and it is vital to remember that this world is often depicted as a spiritual desert because few bear fruit for God. In a desert, people wander aimlessly, lacking true nourishment or direction. The desert is vast, seemingly endless, and the winds blow fiercely, shifting direction unpredictably. Today the wind blows one way, tomorrow another. This is how the world lives, and this is how many of us live—drifting wherever the wind takes us, lost in this spiritual desert.  

But the Lord calls us to create oases with His help. He desires to strengthen us, making us immune to the distractions and temptations of this world. He wants us to bear fruit, to see life and growth flourish within us. He longs for us to experience true comfort, freedom, and spiritual celebration, rather than constant suffering.  

Let us remember this and strive to create such oases. We must cut away everything that seeks to drag us in the wrong direction. We must ask ourselves: Is Christ present in our lives? It is only through His name, through His power, that we can resist the pull of this world.  

Sadly, many have heard of Christ and know the Bible, yet they do not understand the true Church. They do not realize that it is in the Holy Communion—in receiving Christ’s body and blood—that we find healing for our souls, restoration, true faith, and wisdom that comes directly from Him.  

Let us be mindful of this. Let us make it our highest priority to do what Christ asks of us, to become children of Christ rather than children of disobedience. May the Lord guide us, strengthen us, and bless us on this journey. Amen.
