# What is “Western Christianity”

Dear brothers and sisters, some of you may be Orthodox, others Catholic, Protestant, or perhaps your relatives or friends are Protestant or Catholic. Today's topic was prompted by a comment from a Russian subscriber, who said, "Well, I'm preaching some Western-style Christianity, and it doesn't look like Orthodox." His comment led me to respond, even though I don't fully understand what he meant, as he never clarified what exactly he found Western, liberal, or heretical in what I say.

This is why I believe some clarification is needed, especially in these times of great spiritual warfare and temptation that the Church—and indeed the whole world—is enduring. It is crucial to discern who is who and what is what. We must also distinguish between teachings and traditions, such as Catholicism or Protestantism, and the individuals who follow them. A person may be Catholic or Protestant, but we must separate the individual from the broader teachings or traditions they adhere to.

I have many friends who are Catholic or Protestant, and they are aware of my stance. I am not a communist, though it is quite common to be one these days, even within the Orthodox Church. There are many within the Church who are liberals, fellow Catholics, or even secretly gay, and they may favor Western, Catholic, or liberal ideas. It is important to discern whether someone, such as a priest, truly upholds Orthodox teachings, even if they claim to be Orthodox.

This is why I was not offended by the comment but found it useful and relevant to address. First and foremost, we must examine the creed—what we believe and the core of our faith. We believe in one, holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. This one Church was established by Jesus Christ, who is its head, and the Church is His body. We cannot have one head with multiple bodies; that would be monstrous. Therefore, we believe in one, holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, and this one holy Church is the Orthodox Church. What else could it be?

Others who believe in Jesus Christ and have the Holy Bible may, in a broad sense, be called Christians because they believe in Christ. However, in a narrower sense, we cannot say they are members of the Church. We can maintain friendships, cooperate, and engage in theological dialogue with them, but we are not in union with them. We cannot say they are united with Jesus Christ in the same way we are through the Holy Eucharist, which is singular and unites us as one body of Christ.

Having said this, we should also recall the Gospel account of a man who was not following the disciples but was casting out demons. The disciples tried to stop him, but the Lord said, "Do not hinder him, for whoever is not against you is for you." Even if someone is not following us directly, if they are doing the work of God, they are not our enemy but our ally. This is an important lesson. We should not judge solely by formalities—whether someone is Orthodox, baptized, or has recently received Holy Communion. To dismiss everyone else as heretics or enemies destined for hell is misguided and extreme.

So, within the Church, we have individuals who may lean liberal or ultra-liberal, conservative or ultra-conservative. However, the Church itself is the truth; it is not divided into liberal or conservative factions. Some people, however, act as though they are holier than the Pope of Rome, as the saying goes—more holy than the Holy Fathers or even Jesus Christ Himself. This criticism may stem from the ultra-conservative camp.

With that said, we must now consider the phenomenon of the Western Christian world, which is primarily composed of Catholicism and Protestantism. How do we view it, and what is our attitude or understanding of it? Today, we don’t have time to delve into why the schism occurred or other historical developments, but we can acknowledge that the Church of Rome was Orthodox for roughly 1,000 years before it split away. Over time, the Western Church, particularly the Latin Church, began to emphasize the primacy of the Pope and introduced new elements to the faith, such as the *filioque* clause. These changes caused it to drift away and eventually break from the Orthodox Church.

After the split, numerous new teachings and errors emerged. Within another 200 years, the Western Church sought to conquer the Byzantine and Orthodox Church, as seen during the Third Crusade when Constantinople was plundered, and people were forcibly converted to Catholicism. These actions revealed that those who called themselves Christians were no longer acting in the spirit of Christ. The spirituality of figures like Francis of Assisi and Ignatius of Loyola, along with practices such as *compasio* and meditations, reflected errors that had crept in. The central spirit of the Antichrist was already at work, as the Pope sought power over the entire Church and even secular governments, pursuing a political agenda. This made it clear that Catholicism was no longer part of the Church of Christ.

What can we say about this? We can say that Catholicism was once our brother, our companion in the fight against the devil, but it has since departed to pursue its own path. While we hope it may one day return to its former state, it has now gone its own way. I am speaking here about Catholicism as a whole, not about individual Catholics.

To illustrate this, consider the parable of the disciples in the ship. They were rowing against the wind and the tempest, struggling to reach the opposite shore. The Lord saw their torment. This is an image of the Church: we are moving against the wind, against the trends of this world, against the power of the prince of this world, the Antichrist, and against all passions, temptations, errors, and deceit. It is a difficult journey.

In the beginning, some of those in the ship—our brothers, such as the Roman Church—were with us. But eventually, they decided to go elsewhere. Why? Because the journey was too tough. They chose a different agenda. The original ship continued forward as it always had, but part of it split off and became another ship, seeking a safer, more stable place. This new ship was guided by worldly standards, free from the harsh winds, and established with properties, income, political power, and other worldly advantages. It moved in that direction, sometimes even colliding with the original ship, which continued to press forward against the devil.

These former brethren changed their perspective, enjoying the power and stability they now possessed. They thought, "We were on a motorboat; now we are powerful. We have something." But in doing so, they departed from the true path of the Church.

But this power they gained came from earthly sources—money, knights, and other worldly means. It no longer served as an obstacle to the devil; in fact, it began to do the devil's work in some ways, all while still calling itself the Church. Over time, some within that boat realized it was heading in the wrong direction. They read the instruction manual—the Gospel—and saw that they were supposed to be journeying toward the kingdom of heaven, not hell. So, they began to jump out of the boat, establishing their own sects and denominations, which became the Protestants. Some tried to swim in the same direction as the Orthodox Church, while others went in completely different directions. Some drowned, and overall, it was a failure. This is what happened.

Of course, we can still learn something from them, as they were once our brothers. They retained some of the skills they had while with us, though they now pursue their own agenda. Why not learn from them? It’s like having a good friend who was once part of the same project as you but later became arrogant and proud, deciding to go his own way. You see that he has changed, and you hope he will return to the shared values and spirit you once had. While he may not come back, you can still recognize and appreciate the qualities that remain from what he used to be. This can help you grow, as it reminds you of what was once shared.

There are many valuable things in the West that date back to the time when it was Orthodox—prayers, works of the Holy Fathers, lives of saints, and missionary experiences. These are part of the Orthodox heritage of the West. As the Orthodox Church, we can learn from this past experience to enrich and deepen our own practices and traditions today. This is not about embracing Catholicism or loving heresy; it is about valuing the Orthodox roots that once existed in the West. We do not abandon our own tradition, nor do we say, "Everything is there, and we have nothing here." Any lack of balance is unhealthy.

We must be wise in these matters, open to friendship and cooperation with anyone willing to fight evil together, regardless of their background or denomination. However, when it comes to the truth, we must be clear: "This is the truth, and this is not the truth." We do not compromise on the truth. If others do not care about the truth, that is their problem, but we care deeply. We must preserve and live by the truth, for it is through the truth that we gain salvation.

May the true spirit of the Gospel guide us, opening our hearts to understanding life according to its teachings. May we remain united with Jesus Christ, and may our Orthodox brethren who are straying or slipping away return to the full knowledge of the truth. For those outside the Church, may they come to learn about the Orthodox faith and the Orthodox Church, not stumbling over poor examples of Orthodox individuals but discovering the richness of the faith through the lives of the saints, especially the recent saints of the Orthodox Church.

Because the recent saints, they speak more about heterodoxy. Saints like Ignatius Brianchaninov and Theophan the Recluse, among many others, have explained these errors and exposed the wrong spirit, the false and fake spirituality that has crept in. Through their teachings, we come to understand the fullness of union with Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist, where we become members of the body of Christ. This enables us to carry out our testimony for the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Amen. May the Lord be with everyone, granting us His strength, wisdom, and humility. Amen. God bless.
