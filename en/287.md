# The Spirits of Babylon and Cain try to ruin the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about a significant issue within the Church. Before I delve into it, I want to clarify something about what the Church truly is. We read in the Creed that we believe in one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. The Church is holy, but we often misunderstand what this means. It is holy in the sense that it is dedicated to God, given a unique mission, ability, and calling. It is guarded by God, by His holy commandments, and by His grace. However, this does not mean, as we often think, that one must be perfectly holy and radiant to be part of the Church.

We tend to think, "Yes, the Church itself is holy," but this can lead to a misconception of an abstract, distant Church—somewhere out there, not connected to us or the brothers and sisters around us. This is a flawed understanding. The Protestants have taken this idea, which developed within the Orthodox Church, and used it to promote the notion of an "invisible Church." They claim that this invisible Church exists somewhere out there, and it is merely a matter of whether you or I belong to it. They argue that this is unrelated to any earthly entity, whether Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican, Lutheran, or Catholic. They use this idea to justify their heresy, allowing them to remain comfortable in their errors without feeling compelled to join the Orthodox Church.

But what is the reality? The reality is that God established His Church as a visible entity. He did not create an invisible Church, brothers and sisters. He established a visible Church. God Himself became visible when He came into this world. The Church is not some distant, abstract concept—it is us, Orthodox Christians. Not all Orthodox Christians, but those who have not strayed so far as to break away from the Church on a spiritual level.

Consider the parables. There is the parable of the yeast mixed into flour, causing the dough to rise and become bread. The flour represents us—it can vary in quality, but as long as it is flour, the bread will rise, even if it is not the most flavorful. It is still bread, not something else. If the flour is replaced with garbage, the result will be something distorted, ugly, and unworthy—something the Lord would reject. That is not the Church. But we, with all our imperfections, weaknesses, and occasional missteps, are still the Church as long as we remain loyal to Christ and strive to follow Him. Some may falter, but as long as we are trying, we are part of the Church.

Another parable is that of the ground. The seed is good, but if the ground is barren, nothing will grow. If the ground is not ideal, the seed may still bear fruit, though perhaps not a hundredfold—maybe only twofold or even onefold. But if the ground is overrun with thorns, stones, or hardness, it will yield no fruit. Such a heart is not part of the Church. The Lord warns that it will be cut off and cast away. He speaks to us, urging us to change before it is too late. But for now, we who are striving to follow Christ, who remain Orthodox and faithful to the true Christ, are still part of His Church. The heretics, however, believe in something else—they do not believe in the true Christ.

Let us remember, brothers and sisters, that the Church is not an abstract ideal. It is us, flawed yet striving, loyal yet imperfect. We are the Church, as long as we remain faithful to Christ and His teachings.

That is why there is not a single saint among the heterodox, so-called heretical world. Today, I want to discuss the Church as we know it and the problems we face within it. I am not referring to heretics, people of other religions, atheists, or secular individuals. However, the issues I will address today are relevant to any human group, whether secular or heretical. I want to talk about the spirit of Babylon and the spirit of Cain. While this is a vast topic, I will briefly describe it as follows:

The spirit of Babylon is when you believe you are serving God, but in reality, you are building something else—something tied to this world. You may be constructing a "Babylonian tower," whether through pursuing wealth, advancing your career, gaining scientific knowledge, developing projects, or excelling in sports. Your heart is consumed by these pursuits, not by Christ or the Kingdom of Heaven. You are being led by the spirit of Babylon. This often relates to ecumenism, as it blurs the lines between Orthodox Christianity and other sects or religions. It can lead to embracing ideologies like communism under the guise of universal love, but this love is not directed toward God—it is love for the world. This is the essence of the spirit of Babylon, and it is closely tied to ecumenism.

Now, let’s address the issues within the Church. In Orthodox countries, where millions or even hundreds of millions of Orthodox Christians reside, this spirit has grown increasingly powerful over the past 30 years, especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While it has not overtaken all Orthodox believers, its influence has been significant and widespread. Among the faithful, this spirit manifests as consumerism—prioritizing real estate, finances, careers, comfort, and hobbies over spiritual matters. Many may claim, "I am Orthodox, I am baptized, I go to church," yet they remain trapped in a materialistic, selfish, and worldly mindset. Fasting is dismissed as unnecessary, and worldly comforts are brought into the Church, such as placing chairs inside, reflecting a relaxed attitude toward spiritual discipline.

Among the clergy and hierarchs, the spirit of Babylon takes different forms. While some are outright materialistic, seeking luxury cars, expensive clothing, and worldly status—essentially acting as Judases—others may not be entirely consumed by such desires but still fall prey to the spirit of Babylon. For instance, they may prioritize building and decorating churches, hosting grand events, gaining media influence, or forming close ties with governments for protection and benefits. They may become entangled in politics or nationalism, promoting the Church as a national entity—be it the Church of Russia, Greece, Romania, or Serbia—rather than focusing on pastoral care, spiritual growth, or mission work. This is worldliness, the spirit of Babylon, building on a foundation that is not of God but of the earth.

The problem is that this spirit has become a pervasive threat, a virus that we must actively resist. While not everyone has succumbed to it, its influence is growing, and we are now entering an even more troubling stage. This is a call to vigilance, to refocus our hearts on Christ and His Kingdom, and to reject the allure of Babylon in all its forms. Let us strive to remain faithful to the true mission of the Church, which is to lead souls to salvation, not to build earthly empires.

This is the stage where the spirit of Babylon is being replaced or complemented by the spirit of Cain. Once the Tower of Babel is built, someone must inhabit it—not merely as a dwelling for people, but as a vessel for a particular spirit. At times, God has allowed the labor of the Babylonians or the Canines to be used for His purposes, but more often, it is exploited by the children of this world—the children of Mammon, darkness, and the devil. Eventually, the spirit of Cain comes to dwell in this tower. The project of the Tower of Babel aligns with the project of Cain. But what, in essence, is the spirit of Cain? It is not about building; it is about destroying. It brings hatred, aggression, totalitarianism, and control. It is a militant spirit, a spirit of hatred, murder, and anger.

This spirit is now finding its way into the hearts of the Orthodox. Of course, this is also happening on a secular level. Over the past 30 years, globalization, consumerism, and ecumenism have dominated the secular and heretical worlds. But now, a new spirit is emerging—the spirit of Cain, the spirit of hatred, the spirit of identifying enemies and hating them. This spirit seeks to protect something, often cloaked in righteous rhetoric. Within the Church, some have become propagandists of hatred, finding excuses to justify their actions—whether in the name of a great Orthodox empire, traditional values, or even democracy, freedom, and openness. They claim that rockets, weapons, and warfare are necessary to destroy evil. Regardless of which side one is on, this spirit is gaining prevalence. The more worldly we become, the more susceptible we are to the spirit of Cain.

Brothers and sisters, I hope you can recognize these temptations within yourselves and in others. The world is now deeply divided, and unfortunately, the Orthodox are also divided on these issues. You may see either the spirit of Babylon or the spirit of Cain at work. However, the spirit of Babylon is fading. The liberal rhetoric of human rights, inclusivity, and minority protections has suddenly turned totalitarian, persecuting anyone who does not conform. We saw this shift clearly in 2020, during the global crisis, when the so-called liberal, loving, and respectful rhetoric transformed into a totalitarian dictatorship. This is the spirit of Cain replacing the spirit of Babylon.

We must develop symbolic thinking and understanding, brothers and sisters. It will help us discern these spirits and resist their influence. Despite the significant threats within the Church, I am convinced that the Holy Spirit is guiding us, and we will overcome these challenges as long as we remain faithful to Christ. Let us devote ourselves to prayer, repentance, and spiritual growth. Let us forgive everyone, weep for our sins, and bear witness to Christ’s love in our lives. Active Christian love—not merely intellectual knowledge—is essential. Learning is good, but it is not enough. We must pray fervently, or we risk becoming spiritually alienated from God, bearing no fruit, and being cut off from His holy Church.

May the Lord protect us from all evil, grant us wisdom, guidance, vigilance, and sobriety, so that we may be prepared for any challenge and avoid all delusion. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
