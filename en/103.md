# Two strategies of devil & antichrist

Dear brothers and sisters, if we want to avoid the temptation of the devil, we need to understand the two main tasks that the devil and the Antichrist have right now, concerning each and every one of us, as well as the whole world. 

The devil's task is to make us disappointed in Christ and in the Church. He wants us to step away from God. Apostasy means stepping out, stepping off, getting away. This is the main sin. When Christ speaks about sin, He says, "This is the main sin: they did not believe in Me." This sin gives rise to all other sins. The Apostle Paul also says that because they did not glorify Him as God, He delivered them to all kinds of carnal temptations and sins. For these people, mammon will become their new lord, and they will serve this mammon, which is the devil. Thus, the fundamental sin is for people not to be in a loving relationship with God.

The task of the Church is not merely to make us believe in certain ideas or concepts. The task is to help us establish this loving relationship, to seek God. Blessed are those who thirst for righteousness, who thirst for truth and righteousness. We want to fill ourselves with God, and as the deer runs to the spring of water, our souls search for You, O Lord. Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven. The Lord wants us to be in that state. Whenever we are deeply disappointed—whether because the Church doesn't give us something or because we feel the Lord will not provide—that is when stepping away happens.

In everyday life, we know that divorces often occur because of disappointment in one another. Even without divorce, relationships can cool down due to unmet expectations. Politicians promise many things but fail to deliver, and we become disappointed and resentful. Similarly, broken relationships or a lack of loyalty to a boss often stem from disappointment. In the same way, the devil wants us to be disappointed with God and His Church.

How does he do it? First, let's discuss how this has been done in the West and in former Orthodox countries. Then we'll talk about how he does it on an individual level, targeting you and me today.

In the West, societies that were once Orthodox were in union with Christ. Over centuries, however, they gradually drifted away, falling into heresies and surrogates of Christianity. They lost the deep, mystical union with Christ, leading to more temptations and a greater pull toward mammon. First, it was the Renaissance, with its focus on carnal pleasures. Then came the Industrial Revolution, emphasizing production, consumption, and the pursuit of wealth. Slowly, people were drawn away from a deeper union with Christ. By the 20th century, even the social norms and traditional values that had been preserved were destroyed, lacking any spiritual foundation. Now, we live in a post-Christian society.

In traditionally Orthodox countries, many people maintained a real union with Christ for centuries. However, even these societies have faced challenges in preserving that deep spiritual connection.
