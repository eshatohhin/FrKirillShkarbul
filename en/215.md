# One World Religion Is Here. And It Will Be Compulsory..

Dear brothers and sisters, we are entering the age of a One World Religion.  
It may sound fantastic, even impossible.  
Today, I want to explain why it is possible.  
In fact, we have already heard announcements about it.  
A religion called Dadaism is emerging, and it is coming in a big way.  
It will not be one of those small, obscure new religions that nobody pays attention to.  
Such sects arise all the time, coming and going.  
For example, there is a sect in Taiwan called Ikuan Tao, which combines all religions.  
They have all the scriptures and worship all gods.  
In a spiritual sense, you could say it is similar to Luciferian religions.  
But this new religion will be significant and entirely different.  
Today, I want to share a few words about what it will look like and what to watch out for.  
Because it is already on its way, and we are being drawn into it.  
I am not just referring to Orthodox Christians but to all humanity on Earth.  
What is it? Why is it so significant?  

There was a writer, Father Seraphim Rose, an Orthodox priest who wrote in the 1960s and 1970s.  
He was a monk in a monastery in the United States.  
One of his books, titled *Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future*, discusses this topic.  
I do not recommend this book to newcomers to Orthodoxy.  
If your spiritual life is not yet stable, it might lead to misunderstandings, confusion, or even fear.  
He writes extensively about the apocalypse, the end times, tribulations, and how the world is being deceived.  
It can be unsettling. At times, he may overstate his case.  
If you want to learn about him, there is a book about his life that is a good starting point.  
Another book, *Nihilism*, explores various religions and philosophies, arguing that the Orthodox faith is the true religion and philosophy.  
It is best to begin with these two books and not rush into others.  

When we read about this in his book and other prophecies, it may seem distant and unimaginable.  
How can people who have been Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Catholic, or Protestant for centuries suddenly embrace a new religion—a religion of the Antichrist?  
Let me explain.  

Many people today do not truly follow any religion.  
In China, there is even a saying in Taiwan: when asked, "What is your religion?" people respond, "Shui Jiao," which means "sleep."  
It is a play on words, as "Jiao" means religion, and "Shui Jiao" means to sleep.  
The joke implies, "Just relax, stay at home, don’t go to church or temple."  
While it is a joke, it carries meaning.  
Most people today identify with a religion or church but do not practice it.  
Even if they do, they do not truly live by it.  
Their faith becomes a matter of formal rituals and obligations.  
Genuine, living faith is rare.  

For example, among Muslims, you might find fervent believers.  
However, their fervor will be redirected into zealous worship of the religion of the future—the religion of the Antichrist.  
It will not be a simple matter of renouncing one’s current faith and declaring, "I now believe in this One World Religion."  
It will not happen that way.  

If this religion has been announced, let us consider: what leads humanity to accept such deities?  
Total godlessness. I discussed this a few months ago in one of my videos.  
You can revisit it if you wish.  
Godlessness—living without God, regardless of religion or tradition—means disregarding His laws, abandoning family values, and pursuing only material wealth.  
This pre-death religion could be called mammonism.

Mammonism is when you consider yourself Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Buddhist, or anything else, but in reality, you worship mammon.  
This is reflected in your lifestyle, values, daily routines, and goals. What is mammon?  
Mammon is money, comfort, career, and selfish interests—earthly values that dominate your life.  
People live for mammon, almost entirely. I am telling you this includes most Christians.  
The absolute majority.  
So, what does this mammonism lead to?  
It leads to a complete disregard for the content of their faith.  
This disregard paves the way for the success of ecumenism.  
When people no longer care about what they believe, and they are told, "Now is the time to unite," they will readily join together to build a false, unified church.  
This church will absorb all branches of Christianity, as well as Hinduism, paganism, and various other cults.  
This is why the ecumenical movement has seen such immense success.  

While these groups may not yet be fully united, the boundaries between different religions and sects have almost disappeared.  
This is why the Pope participates in rituals for Pachamama, and Catholics study the spirituality of yoga and Hinduism, practicing pagan traditions.  
They see no conflict because they already worship mammon.  
In these practices, they find another version of mammon, and they blend them seamlessly.  
This is possible because they are far removed from the true Lord and genuine spirituality.  
They no longer feel the truth or possess it within themselves.  
Unfortunately, this also applies to many Orthodox Christians. However, there is still hope in the Orthodox Church, which remains the only source of resistance to this movement.  

What else can we say about this new religion?  
It will eliminate pluralism, independent thinking, and decision-making.  
It will create "data humans"—not humans as we know them, but individuals who have lost their personalities and are guided by external imperatives, such as artificial intelligence.  
In the past, societies were drawn into certain myths or narratives, like Nazism under Hitler or Stalinism.  
These were localized phenomena. But now, this will be global.  
There will be a global narrative, as outlined in books like *The Great Narrative* by Klaus Schwab.  
This narrative will draw in all people, even as the world appears fragmented and chaotic.  

This chaos is preparing the way. People are more willing to embrace new ideas during times of crisis.  
This is what is happening now. Humanity was profoundly shaken during the events of 2020, and this disruption continues on a massive scale.  
We are entering an age of technological integration, where AI and human intelligence are merging.  
There is a roadmap for this, with goals set every five years, leading up to 2050, when minds may be uploaded to the cloud.  
This might sound like an exaggeration, but these plans are being actively pursued.  
Whether they happen sooner or later, we do not know, but the direction is clear.  
Corporations, wars, and the development of new technologies are all driving humanity toward this future.  

At that point, people will lose their ability to make individual judgments.  
They will be told that true freedom lies in obedience to the imperatives given to them.  
Eventually, this new religion will be presented as the ultimate solution.  
They will say, "You see, all solutions come from the system."

You will have to be connected to this system, where AI assumes all responsibilities for your life—how you live, your financial decisions, your choices.  
Everything will be "correctly" advised by AI.  
Your health, social rating, and every aspect of your existence will be managed and controlled by AI.  
They will not simply present it as AI. At that point, they will declare, "Do you believe this is the source of all good, salvation, and wisdom?"  
If you believe it, you will receive it. And people will willingly accept it.  

By claiming that all good things, all benefits, all wisdom, and everything worthwhile come from being connected to this system, people will have to abandon their trust in the Lord and their obedience to His commandments.  
They may still formally identify as Orthodox, Catholic, Hindu, or whatever else.  
But these labels will become mere costumes, superficial appearances.  
In reality, they will be part of this One World Religion, because they will regard this system as a god.  
After all, it provides everything: it predicts your future, ensures your safety, and handles every aspect of your life.  
People will embrace this en masse, everywhere.  

This is why the Book of Revelation states that both rich and poor, slaves and free, will receive the mark of the beast.  
Of course, it will not be called the "mark of the beast." It will likely be presented as a new QR code or something similar—perhaps ID 2020, 2040, or 2140.  
We do not know exactly when it will happen, but we can see it coming.  

Let us not dismiss this as alarmism or fearmongering. We are not afraid.  
We simply need to understand what is happening so that we are not deceived or drawn into this narrative that leads to the worship of Lucifer.  
May the Lord be with us. Grant us wisdom and strength. Help us remain autonomous in all things.  
Even if we lose everything—even our lives—may we remain faithful to our Lord, who is the source of all salvation, healing, and wisdom.  

Amen. May the Lord be with you and protect you from all evil.  
God bless.
