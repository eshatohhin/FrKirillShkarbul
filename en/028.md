# How to face and overcome problems

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will pleasantly and joyfully talk about unpleasant things—about sadness, hardships, and the difficulties we may experience in life. In our times, this becomes even more important due to the pandemic. People are suffering economically and psychologically. The number of suicides has increased, and cases of drug overdoses and many other issues are on the rise. This tells us that people are truly suffering. In some countries, the economy is devastated, and things are really bad, really difficult. Therefore, it is important for us to think more about such situations, as every one of us has faced times when things are tough. We need to be ready for anything. As soldiers of Christ, we must be prepared, even if things are going well right now.

Today, we will discuss this because when we are in a bad situation, when we are truly suffering, it is painful. We experience pain or anxiety about where to get money or what will happen tomorrow—things like that. In these circumstances, the Lord is actually closer to us than at any other time. He is with those who mourn and suffer; He is truly close to us. However, we might still be far from Him because we could be in despair, depression, or anger at everyone, at the world, at life. At that moment, we might be very far from God. But this is a good opportunity for us to turn to Him. He is very close to us then, wanting to support and rescue us, but our hearts may be elsewhere, blinded. This is the time to come to our senses and turn to Him. This is why many people come to church after experiencing suffering. As a parish priest, I often see that suffering brings people to church.

In our daily lives, we strive to make life better. This is our routine direction—we work to earn money, improve family relationships, and focus on these concerns every day. However, the biggest risk is that in being preoccupied with these things, we forget about God. This is the greatest spiritual danger, and it happens very often, almost all the time. When everything is going well, we might think, "Why do I need God? Just to have an icon, to feel assured that everything is fine—I am fine, He is fine, everyone is fine." But we don’t truly need Him. This is why the Lord may send us messages and show us that life is not so easy. Even when we achieve what we call a "happy life" or stability, it may not last long if we have forgotten about God. This is the biggest problem.

Therefore, it is important for us to always keep our priorities straight. No matter what we do—whether we work, study, rest, or engage in other activities—we must seek God everywhere, in everything. Our hearts should always be alive in prayer; we should talk to God and see Him in others. Our entire lives should be filled with the mission the Lord has given us. If we live with the Lord, no matter what we do, we will have His prolonged blessing. He will be close to us always, even when things are going well, because He will know that we are not deeply attached to worldly things. These things in our lives will not block Him; He will remain our main priority.

This is what is important. We do not need to wait for great suffering, tragedies, or hardships to come into our lives. We prepare ahead of time. We use even smaller misfortunes or suffering to become meeker and to develop compassion for others.

We can observe that people who have experienced something truly terrible—perhaps they were in a concentration camp, lost their entire family, became orphans, or endured war or some other great tragedy in life—often become kinder than others. They tend to be more understanding, willing to listen to your problems, less selfish, and more humble. You can sense a certain warmth emanating from these individuals. They are not boastful, thinking, "I can do whatever I want; I am the best; my opinion is the most important." They are not like that. And this is not a sign of weakness—it is actually strength.  

You might think that something is broken in these people. Sometimes that may be the case, but not always. Usually, it is not brokenness. Perhaps it is their pride and selfishness that have been broken. This transformation brings a spiritual fragrance to their lives and hearts, making them more compassionate and kinder. There is a wisdom in their eyes. Why does this happen? It happens because, in their suffering, they drew close to God and used that opportunity in the right way. Most of the time, this is the case. Even if they do not realize it themselves, God has brought them through this "educational training," and now they have become this way.  

Therefore, we should not fear any difficulties or sufferings that come into our lives. We must be strong in Christ and ready to withstand anything. In Psalm 34, the Lord says, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all." There may be many sorrows and unpleasant things, but a Christian has a deep hope and assurance that they are journeying toward the kingdom of heaven. This reality lives in their heart, and they understand that all these trials are temporary. They are opportunities to grow stronger, to become better soldiers of Christ, and to become someone others can rely on.  

This is what the Lord wants for us—to be like this. He will give us His blessing if we maintain the right direction in our minds and lives and do not forget Him. We need to find balance, avoiding extremes. We should not become too relaxed, thinking, "Life is good; I don’t care about anything." Nor should we live in panic or constant stress. Instead, we should remain spiritually alive, vigilant, and always mindful of God. We should not become overly complacent, yet we should still walk with joy and confidence in life, knowing that the Lord is with us and guiding us.  

May the Lord grant us such a heart, such a life, and His blessing. Amen.
