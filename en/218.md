# Distortion of Orthodoxy An Unexpected Threat

Dear brothers and sisters, we often focus on external threats. Whether on an individual level or a church level, we always talk about external enemies, the persecution of the church, temptations, and the Antichrist seeking to conquer us. All those heresies, satanists, world governments, those who design sicknesses, the globalists who hold all the power and seek to brainwash and control the world—heresies, all kinds of external threats. The world is going crazy. There is so much sin. They have wrong values. They seduce children. It's all about them. Okay, all the problems. This is another temptation that disarms us, that causes us to fail—both spiritually and in terms of life situations. The right way to change that is to think deeply about the threats that come from within. 

For example, these external threats create fear. But when I think about the times I felt the greatest fear in my life, it was during periods when I was far from God. Perhaps it was in my youth when I made mistakes. In those days, I felt fear about everything—about the future, about people, about myself, about many things. You can notice that whenever we drift away from God—when we pray less, do wrong things, say wrong things, or have unclean thoughts—many fears arise. This explains something. It is just an example of how the internal state of your soul is crucial and important for overall success. I am talking about spiritual success, success as a Christian, success in following Christ, and in fulfilling the right mission in your life. The same is true for the Church as a whole. 

When the Church claims that all threats and bad things come from outside, it places itself in the position of a wronged victim or a holy and shining agent in this world, without the need for self-criticism, reflection, or change. This creates significant problems—hypocrisy and blindness. Whenever there is blindness, whether on an individual or Church level, it is a great threat. 

First, let us list some threats we often discuss in the Church. We talk about the influence of society—people are sinners, society is consumerist, people serve mammon, everyone is greedy, everyone seeks comfort, and we are influenced by this. This is a significant threat to Christianity. Or consider wrong teachings, heresies, false religions, paganism, New Age, yoga—all these things. I am speaking more about religious yoga, but even regular yoga can be harmful because of the mindset and lifestyle that accompanies it, which is essentially pagan. It is even Luciferian, you could say, because it replaces God with Lucifer. There are many other threats as well. 

We can talk about economic and political threats, family threats stemming from trauma or bad examples within the family. We can discuss the propagation of wrong values, such as abortion, the promotion of sodomy, and many other things. There is also the widespread propaganda of sin through commercials, videos, movies—everywhere you look. Additionally, there is political propaganda that pressures you to support a particular political party, movement, or war. You are told you must be involved. These are real threats coming from outside. 

However, all these threats would not harm us if we did not have those loopholes—like a broken vessel with cracks through which water leaks. We have cracks in our souls, and it is because of these cracks that external threats harm us, more or less.

So, the solution to this is reciprocal—it goes both ways. We have a problem with our perverted, sick heart and soul, and we have external problems, and they exacerbate each other. This is a two-way process; it’s not all coming from within, nor is it all coming from without. It’s one integrated process, let’s call it that. 

The healing for this is not self-persuasion. It cannot be artificial. The healing comes from God Himself, from His grace. Our goal is to grow in Christian virtue—to become more humble, to love prayer, to pray more, and to take it step by step. This will help us see things differently, make us invincible against sin, and render external threats harmless. Many of these threats we won’t even notice. 

Think about your day. If you begin it with prayer, pray throughout the day, and maintain the right mindset about what you do and why you do it, I assure you, it will be a spiritually successful day. Even if it’s a difficult day in your career, family life, or if significant external threats arise, you will not fall. You will feel that the day was a success. This is something very important to always remember and not lose sight of. 

The same applies to the Church as a whole. We should not overly promote the idea that everything bad is coming at us from everywhere, that we must constantly be on guard and fight against it. While this is partly true, it is not the whole truth. This wrong idea can lead to two dangerous outcomes. 

First, it can lead to passivity: "No matter what happens, it’s all in God’s hands, so I can’t influence anything. We don’t need to fight evil because we can’t do anything." Second, it can lead to despair: "Everything is in the hands of the world government and those bad guys, so I can’t change anything." In both cases, we become slaves—whether to a false sense of humility or to a sense of helplessness. This is a distortion of Orthodox Christianity. 

We must not fall into either of these traps. In the Orthodox faith, we must begin from within. We know that the biggest problem is me, myself. I must work on fixing this problem every day, all the time. As I address my internal state, it will influence how I engage with the world. This can have a dramatic impact, but I must fix myself first. 

This is the solution to these mistakes and distortions. May the Lord help us, grant us wisdom, and give us the motivation to change ourselves, to become wiser, to become true soldiers of Christ, and to contribute to the mission of the Holy Church in this world. May the Lord bless you and grant you His wisdom. God bless.
