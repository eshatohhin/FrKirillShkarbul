# Mission in Northern Sri Lanka

Today we are in the Mission, located in the northern part of the island.  
This area is populated by Tamil people.  
They have a different language and religion; most of them are Hindu.  
They came from India more recently.  
This is Pastor Jagat. We go together to do mission work, and this is one of the families we visited.  
In the background is our car. This is Pastor Greshen, and we will now visit another family.  
Please pray for us and our mission here. God bless.
