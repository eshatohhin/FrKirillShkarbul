# The flu and the war Apollyon took out the dog-collar

Dear brothers and sisters, our Lord Jesus Christ said, "Be vigilant and pray, lest you fall into temptation." That is from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 41.  

Last time, I spoke about blindness—spiritual blindness that blocks one's ability to perceive the truth. Many people are unable to see the truth. They either outright reject it, saying, "No, I don't want it; I don't need it," or they fail to hear it, as it slips their attention. Others may say, "Yes, yes, yes," but they continue living according to their old ways, enslaved to mammon.  

When the world is in blindness, when the majority of people are spiritually blind, this cannot simply be ignored. There must be a new master who will come and take hold of these people. If their Lord is not God, another lord will come—one who will enslave them. This is the Prince of this world, as he is called, and he will seize every opportunity to do so. Whenever he is capable, he will act.  

Today, I want to discuss how this is unfolding on a global scale. I am not going to talk about conspiracies or specific individuals orchestrating events. Instead, I will focus on the spirit of the Antichrist, which is behind what is happening.  

In warfare, there is a tactic where you create danger or wait for your opponent to become weak, afraid, and demoralized. Then, you force them to accept your terms, placing a kind of collar or bondage on them in that moment. If you wait too long, it will be too late. You know that now is the time to act, so you do it.  

This has happened many times throughout world history, particularly after the French Revolution and later during the European Revolutions of the mid-19th century, from 1848 to 1854. Since then, there have been numerous instances where a force—call it the New World Order or whatever—has imposed a framework on nations. It is not just individuals or governments but entire nations and societies that accept new terms, new values, or what some call a social contract. This has taken many forms.  

One significant example was a kind of rehearsal for the coming of the Antichrist in the Soviet Union, in Russia. World War I created chaos and made life miserable, especially in Russia. The enemy used this opportunity to destroy the monarchy, dismantle a strong Orthodox empire, and impose a new set of values and a new social order in what became the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks seized power as a result of the suffering and danger brought by World War I.  

They presented themselves as saviors, promising a bright future: industrialization, prosperity, freedom, and liberation for the proletariat. They claimed, "You used to be slaves, but now you will be kings; you will rule everything." Yet, we know what followed: the Red Terror, the civil war in Russia, and approximately 10 million deaths. A new totalitarian system emerged, marked by the Gulag and other atrocities. It was presented as salvation, and many who lived through that time believed it to be so. Lenin, the Communist Party, and their ideology were glorified like gods.  

This was merely a rehearsal, a preparation for what is to come. It was accompanied by widespread apostasy, as the Bolsheviks persuaded masses of people that there was no God. For them, the Communist Party became their god. This ideology spread to half the world—China, Africa, Vietnam, and many other places.

But do not think that this is all history, that it is all in the past. We now have another totalitarian system in place, called neoliberalism. This is another ideology, but that is a topic for another time.  

The New World Order has taken shape in stages, with similar developments occurring during the Second World War, Perestroika, and now in our current times. The Apostle Paul tells us that the plans of Satan are not unknown to us. What are these plans? His goal is to gain absolute power over the entire world, to subject all people to him, making them happy slaves. You will be happy, owe nothing, and feel content. But his aim is not merely to steal your freedom and enslave you—it is to steal your soul. The devil is a thief and a murderer. He wants to steal your soul so that you worship him as God, and he will achieve this through the spiritual blindness of people.  

In essence, this means that you will enjoy your submission to him. You will completely surrender to his will, doing whatever he desires with joy—even striving to fulfill his commands faster than he demands. The whole world will become like a swarm of his slaves, his servants.  

But how is this possible? How could such a thing ever happen? It is not yet a reality, though he is coming closer to achieving it. He already controls the economy, politics, media, and the narrative. We see how people willingly go to war, though that is another topic.  

So, what happened in 2020? We must truly understand this, for the Lord warned us to be vigilant and pray, lest we fall into temptation. We do not want to fall into temptation, because the devil will attempt to deceive even the elect—the Christians, those who are faithful and loyal to Christ. He is already succeeding to some extent.  

In 2020, the devil used a "collar" to try to tame all of humanity. He exploited a sickness—I will not name it, but you know what I am referring to—as an excuse, a means to impose his will on the world. He sought to control every aspect of life: requiring permission for every action, eliminating privacy, restricting spending to limited amounts and specific items, controlling relationships, dictating whom you communicate with or gather with, and monitoring all your property. Nothing could be done without his knowledge. Travel was restricted, and you needed permission to go anywhere. He wanted you to be happy simply to be alive, to feel grateful for the "safety" he provided. He presented this as salvation, as a guarantee for your life and future.  

But this is not true freedom. It is bondage disguised as safety, a system designed to enslave you while making you believe you are being saved. We must remain vigilant, for the devil's schemes are subtle and deceptive. Let us pray and stay faithful, so that we do not fall into his traps.

This was a trial run, a repetition. At that point, he did not intend to leave things as they were. Instead, he imposed this system on humanity to test its fit, to observe reactions—how different countries responded, what resistance emerged, and what adjustments were needed. After this experiment, he removed some elements while leaving others in place for the long term. For example, QR codes are now ubiquitous, something that did not exist before. He removed the most obvious restrictions, declaring, "Now it's over," but he now knows what needs to be done next.  

He has learned where to focus his efforts. For instance, he knows that in some regions, like Taiwan, people are more accepting of such measures. In other places, like parts of the US, Europe, or Russia, resistance is stronger. To overcome this resistance, he now sees the need for war, economic crises, revolutions in Africa, or other destabilizing events. He has a clear agenda: to create the conditions where people will no longer be able to escape his control.  

He is preparing the technology and infrastructure—digital IDs, digital currency, artificial intelligence, and more—so that the next time he imposes his will, people will be unable to resist. He will place the collar around your neck permanently, and you will be happy to wear it. To achieve this, he must also brainwash people further, break their will, and make them more addicted to various vices—drugs, distractions, and other forms of dependency.  

I am not speaking of a world government, secret societies, or Satanists wielding power. I am referring to the spirit of the Antichrist, which operates behind the scenes. People, especially those in positions of power—occultists, perverse degenerates, and the proud—often become instruments of his will. As the book of Job describes, Leviathan is the master of the proud. Those who seek vain glory and power are given what they desire, but in doing so, they serve his purposes.  

This is why many who rise to high positions today are already slaves and servants of Leviathan. They are tools in his hands, advancing his agenda.  

Even nations with strong traditions of faith and morality, like Russia and Ukraine, which resisted the post-Christian, neoliberal Babylon, have been blinded. They have been fed opposing narratives, convincing them to go to war against each other. People are persuaded to kill and die, even being paid to do so. They are given a choice: "You want to die? I will pay you for it." High salaries are offered to those willing to go and kill or be killed. The message is clear: "This is your choice, your responsibility. If you die, it is your fault. It was your decision."  

This is the state of the world today. The spirit of the Antichrist is at work, deceiving nations, breaking wills, and preparing for ultimate control. We must remain vigilant, pray, and resist his schemes, lest we fall into his traps.

Indeed, they are employing a cunning strategy—one that is, in a twisted way, genius. This is what is happening, brothers and sisters. We must be ready. With sadness, pain, and sorrow, I must acknowledge that the tests we faced in 2020 and then in 2022, with the war, revealed our failure as a whole. We, the Christians, on a large scale, failed. Most people were unprepared and reacted in the wrong way—this includes the clergy, the hierarchs, and the regular faithful.  

We must draw lessons from this. We need to understand that what happened was merely a rehearsal, a practice run. Many people think, "Oh, it's over now. Let's move on and forget about it," immersing themselves once again in worldly pursuits—buying things, enjoying life. But this is blindness. People remain blind, failing to grasp what truly happened, and they continue their lives in this state of spiritual ignorance.  

May the Lord protect us from all danger, from all deception, from a faith that bears no fruit. May He save us from a lack of vigilance, from spiritual sleep, from a lack of love and repentance, from being unfaithful to Him, and from being indecisive in our fight against addictions and weaknesses.  

May the Lord forgive us, grant us humility, and fill us with love and eagerness to serve Him. We must take our spiritual lives very seriously; otherwise, we will be deceived. May the Lord guard us from all this evil.  

God bless you, brothers and sisters.
