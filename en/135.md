# Why fasting and prayer may be in vain

Dear brothers and sisters, we have entered the Great Lent, and there is a very important condition for any prayer, any fasting, or any sacrifice that we may offer to God. 
Very often, we forget about this condition, and as a result, we encounter problems. During the first week, we often fail. If we genuinely attempt to fast, we will find by the end of this first week that we are unable to sustain it. 
We falter, we experience weaknesses. Our will is fragile. We harbor various passions within us that pull us in different directions. If we are earnest about fasting, we will come to realize this. 

One of the reasons for this struggle is what I will now explain. Another reason is our pride and arrogance; we believe that we can accomplish things on our own. 
We might think, "Okay, now it's Great Lent, I will do it," and we assume it will be our achievement, that we will make progress and draw closer to God. We focus too much on ourselves, believing that we are capable of something. 
But we must fulfill this condition. And as a result, we become humble, recognizing our need for repentance, acknowledging that without Christ, without His saving grace, we can do nothing. 
We come to know God by recognizing our weakness, by seeing that we are perishing, that we are headed toward hell if we do not change, and that the Lord does not grant His grace and healing to us without this realization. 

This is what often happens during the first week. This spiritual condition is crucial because it applies not only during Great Lent but to any prayer. This is thoroughly analyzed by Saint Nicholas Cabasilas, 
one of the greatest saints of the Church, who lived in the 14th century and wrote a profound book on the Divine Liturgy. 
In this book, he explains that at the beginning of the Liturgy, we say, "In peace let us pray to the Lord." This is a prerequisite for all other prayers—that we pray in peace. 
We often overlook the depth of this statement, simply repeating it without much thought. But without this peace, we cannot truly pray. 
If we attempt to pray without peace, our prayers are not received by God; they are merely empty words. 

Today, I want to reflect with you on the meaning of "In peace." 
Saint Nicholas explains that there are four steps to prayer. 
Only by progressing through these steps can we truly begin to pray. The fourth step is the prayer itself—the petition, where we ask something of the Lord. 
For example, we might ask for forgiveness, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy." This is the act of petition, of requesting something from the Lord. 
But before we can make this request, we must first go through three other steps. 

What are these steps? The first step is the glorification of God. This is why the Divine service begins with the words, "Blessed is the kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages." 
This is our blessing, our glorification of the Lord's kingdom. 
Why is glorification the first step? Because when we encounter God in prayer, when we stand before Him, our first instinct is to recognize His majesty, His glory, His transcendence beyond our comprehension, His beauty, and His greatness. 
This is our initial impression when we draw near to Him and stand before Him in prayer. 
This first encounter leaves us in awe, even trembling, as we are struck by His magnificence. 
In response, we glorify Him. 
This is the first thing we do. 

As we continue our dialogue with Him, as we stand in His presence, the second step is the recognition of His grace, His benevolence, and His love for the world and for us. 
This is the second discovery we make as we take another step forward. 
In response to this, we express our gratitude. We thank Him. 
This gratitude arises because, at the same time, we also recognize our unworthiness, our impurity, and our sinfulness.

And despite all this, He is still willing to speak to us. He grants us the opportunity to stand before Him, He gives us life, and He helps us.  
This further deepens our gratitude.  
At the same time, we see ourselves as sinners, as being far from Him. This realization brings us to repentance, the third step—repentance and confession of our sins, of our sinful nature.  
This is the third reaction, the third step that must take place. Only after we have understood and felt this can we ask something of Him. First, we ask for His mercy.  
This is the initial petition. Then, we ask for other things—first for spiritual needs, which are more important, and then for physical needs, such as help in this life.  
But this first petition, "Lord, have mercy," is also the plea of prisoners, of those who are condemned.  
When you are convicted in court, and you know you are guilty, the only thing you can do is ask, "Please, have mercy on me."  
This is what we ask of the Lord—the first petition—that He does not look upon our sins but grants us His mercy and forgiveness.  
This is the first petition. After that, we ask for other things. We ask for His help during Great Lent, for His blessing in our lives, for guidance in our spiritual and daily lives.  
We also ask for other forms of assistance in our physical lives when we need it. All of this follows these four steps. These steps are part of the process of beginning a dialogue with God about our needs.  
Without this, it is impossible to be heard by the Lord. All our prayers would be in vain, and Great Lent would be in vain as well.  

So, why peace? What is the significance of peace? Saint Nicholas explains that only those who have gratitude toward the Lord and who confess their sins can have peace in their hearts—peace with themselves, with others, and with God.  
We can see this in our lives. When we are dissatisfied with our lives, with what is happening around us—whether it is war, economic crises, job losses, refugees, or death—we lack gratitude for what we have been given.  
We feel entitled to something better. This lack of gratitude creates conflict and tension within us. We cannot have inner peace if we are unhappy, if we hold grudges, or if we complain about our lives.  
Only when we let go of these feelings and are thankful to God for everything can we find peace.  

Similarly, if our conscience is unclean—if we are burdened by unconfessed sins or if our conscience has become numb—we cannot have peace in our hearts.  
Without acknowledging ourselves as sinners in need of forgiveness, we remain in turmoil.  
Therefore, confession is also part of the phrase, "In peace let us pray to the Lord." We must have gratitude and repentance to achieve peace in our hearts.  
Only with this peace can we truly serve the Lord. If you do not have peace today, this day is wasted—or worse, it may harm you further.  
If you lack peace, abstaining from meat, fasting, or reciting long prayers will all be in vain.  
It will amount to nothing.  

Let us reflect deeply on this. Let us quickly go and confess our sins, seeking peace with the Lord, peace within our hearts, and peace with others.  
This is why we have Forgiveness Sunday. We strive to make peace with everyone, forgiving all and everything.  
This peace—with others, with God, and within ourselves—is the condition for entering the path of Great Lent and truly moving toward salvation.

Without this, there is no salvation—only hell. This is not merely something nice to have; it is the only way.  
So, let us reflect deeply on this. Let us reconsider how we pray, how we fast, and how we respond to the events unfolding in the world today. Only then can we truly be with God and do something meaningful for Him and for this world.  
May the Lord grant you peace, wisdom, success, and growth in your spiritual life during this Great Lent.  
Amen. God bless.
