# Kabbalistic Christianity and the Idol of Nation

Dear brothers and sisters, my last video caused some misunderstandings about who Jews are, what Judaism is, and also about patriotism and nationalism. Today, I want to clarify these points because they are important.

Some people accuse Jews of all sins, blaming them for killing Christ, for all wars, all historical problems, the enslavement of nations, and everything else. On the other hand, some claim that Judaism is the source of everything, the foundation of Christianity, and that Jews are our elder brothers from whom we must learn. This, however, is a complete betrayal of Christianity.

Where do we find the truth? What is the truth? Today, I hope that even Jews could listen to my video without taking offense. I am talking about religious Jews because this raises another question: Is Judaism a nation or a religion?

I believe it depends on the individual. If you consider yourself a Jew by ethnicity, then you are a Jew by ethnicity. If you consider yourself a Jew by religion, then you are a Jew by religion. It is up to each person to decide. People should not impose their views on others, saying, "Oh no, you are this" or "You are that." Let people decide for themselves whether they are Jews or not. This is one question.

In Soviet times, and in countries after the Soviet Union, there was an idea that being Jewish was a nationality, not a religion, because there were many atheist Jews. For Russians and Jews from the USSR, it is often understood as an ethnic identity, not a religious one. However, in other places, such as among more traditional Jews in the U.S. and elsewhere, they would say, "No, being Jewish means adhering to the religion. If you are a Jew, you must believe this, this, and this; otherwise, you are not a Jew."

Let people decide for themselves. This is not my topic today. As Christians, we must love everyone; this is fundamental. There should be no discrimination against any person based on their nation, religion, age, ability, or anything else. Every human being is a person of God, created in the image of God and endowed with the great dignity of being children of God by birth. Being children of God by faith is another matter, but even by simply being human, in some sense, we say they are children of God, belonging to God, and bearing His image. You can see the image of God in everyone.

God loves everyone, even the most evil, corrupt, or perverted person. God loves them and wants them to be saved. The Bible tells us that God desires every single person to be saved. For us, there is no one who is inherently evil. There are evil actions, thoughts, ideas, and ideologies, but not people as they are by nature.

This is the first thing we must acknowledge. We would never say that all Jews are guilty of certain sins or that they are all cursed by the Lord. No, that is nonsense. However, it is also wrong to claim that one nation is above all others, treating other nations as inferior or subhuman. This is religious fascism and Nazism, and I won’t specify who believes in such ideas—perhaps you know.

What we can say is that we need to distinguish between Jews as people, including religious Jews, and Judaism as a religion. Judaism itself has different factions and denominations that often do not get along. Among these denominations, there are many people seeking truth. We need to talk to them and witness our faith to them.

And I believe that those who are humble and truly righteous in their hearts will find the truth and will discover Jesus Christ.

Having said this, I want to say a few words about nationalism because the influence of Judaic, rabbinic, and later Talmudic occultist ideas on Christianity is significant. We have the Reformation and Catholicism, which, in fact, is a product of these Judaic ideas infiltrating the Church. The separation of the Roman Church is akin to how Christ cut away the Judaic leaders of His time, as they no longer had the Lord's blessing to guide the flock of God. The old Church lost its blessing, just as old Israel did, and the new Israel became the Church of Christ. Later, the Church of Christ lost the Roman Church, which fell into a similar problem. Essentially, this was the Judaization of Christianity.

Later, during the Reformation, this Judaization led to a complete separation between God and the world. This separation meant there was no holy people, no divine liturgy, no holy relics, no sacraments, no priests, and no holy tradition. It reduced everything to just people—mere flesh—and God, with only the Holy Bible as the sole authority, as if it fell from the sky. This view rejects the idea that Christ lives in the Church today, effectively silencing Jesus by saying, "No more words, only what is written in the Bible." It reduces the New Testament to a mere recollection of what Jesus said and did, with nothing more. But for the Church, Christ gave Himself in the Holy Eucharist. When we receive the body and blood of Christ, we receive Christ Himself. He speaks to us and lives in us within the Church.

Protestants, in rejecting this, align with a Judaic, legalistic understanding of justification, where God is seen as a judge who declares guilt or innocence. This legalistic idea also stems from Judaism. Furthermore, nationalism—particularly when religious importance is attached to one's nation or country—elevates it above all else. This mindset contributed to the First World War, where mass education taught people that their nation was everything, leading them to sacrifice blood and land for these ideals. This concept of nationalism is rooted in Judaism, as such ideas were absent in the ancient world and even in the Middle Ages. Only during the time of Christ do we see this struggle for nation, country, land, and blood. Yet, Jesus never supported or affirmed these nationalistic movements; He stayed away from political turmoil and nationalistic fervor.

We can also see that secularization, rationalism, and even medieval scholasticism have roots in Judaism, Kabbalah, and occultist ideas. What we now face, such as transhumanism, also originates from Kabbalah. I won’t elaborate further, as my video might be blocked, but I believe this is a grave mistake with terrible consequences. These outcomes will grow even more severe and will eventually lead to the rise of the false Messiah—the one the Jews desired in the time of Christ, which is why they crucified Him. They wanted the Antichrist, and this is what they continue to seek. Those who adhere to the religion of Judaism are misguided, inspired by the spirit of the Antichrist. This is the reality.

So we can see that, as they say, 97% of those who adhere to Judaism are expecting the Messiah. However, we know that a political and earthly king of the universe will be the Antichrist. We must be careful not to fall into this trap. This shift occurs largely due to the influence of Judaism on Christianity, where nations that were once Christian have now become fake Christians. For example, we see how the Germans embraced Nazism and fascism, elevating themselves as a super nation and super race. Where does this ideology come from? You can tell me. Eugenics and many other movements are aimed at creating a new world order that will pave the way for the Antichrist.

All the wars we face today, which are growing increasingly worse, can be traced back to the spirit of this world—the one about whom Christ said, "He has nothing in Me." When we talk about a Jew, we can say that a true Jew is a Christian, because a Jew is one who carries the glory of God—you and me. In Romans chapter 2, we read: "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God."

Even in the early Church, there were attempts to Judaize Christians. False preachers came to Christians and said, "You need to be circumcised and follow all the rituals of Judaism to become 'Christians plus,' to become an elite, higher form of Christian." This was an attempt to Judaize Christianity. If we are careful with terms, we can say that we are the true Jews in spirit—Christians who are circumcised in the heart, loyal to Christ, and not subject to the Judaizing process that occurred historically.

Let us be aware of this and trace the roots of many movements, such as Gnosticism, Mysticism, Theosophy, and others, back to Kabbalah and the Talmud. You will see that these ideas are not merely human inventions but are driven by a spirit—a spirit that is not of God. I hope you understand which spirit I am referring to.

May the Lord grant us the ability to discern spirits. As we read in Romans 12:1-2, particularly verse 2: "And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." By distinguishing between the spirit of this fallen, earthly world and the Spirit of the Lord, which is divine and true, we can understand the will of God and receive His blessings.

May the Lord grant us this wisdom, humility, and love. May He guide all those who are still far from Him, who are searching for answers or living in darkness, and bring them to the knowledge of the truth and salvation in our Lord, the true Messiah and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. Christ be with you. Amen.
