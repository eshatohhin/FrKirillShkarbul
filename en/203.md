# The Entrance of the Lord to Jerusalem Joy or Weeping

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church is celebrating the entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem. This marks the beginning of Passion Week, the last week before Holy Pascha. In the early Church, this Passion Week was actually THE Pascha. It was more significant because Passover represents the event of conquering, of liberation, and overcoming death and sin. Thus, it is the manner in which the Lord brings salvation that is crucial. Salvation itself, the resurrection, is the joyful fruit of this. But if we do not understand the path to salvation, there is no point in celebrating the victory, because we do not gain the victory.

On this day, there are many mysterious things. Many prophets prophesied about what would happen, and that this is exactly how the Messiah would come into His glory. All the Jerusalemites know that today these prophecies will be fulfilled. Yet, they do not truly understand the meaning of the Messiah.

Let us look at the Gospel of Luke, chapter 19, beginning from verse 35: "And they brought Him the donkey, to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. And as He went, they spread their clothes in the way. And when He was come nigh, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, saying, 'Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven and glory in the highest.' And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto Him, 'Master, rebuke Thy disciples.' And He answered and said unto them, 'I tell you that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.'"

We can try to imagine such a great celebration, exaltation, and praise. This was the dream, the hope of Israel for thousands of years—that the Messiah would come, that the Messiah would bring salvation. They were laying down their garments because after He passed through, they could show these garments to their grandchildren for many generations, saying, "Look, this is the garment upon which the Messiah rode on the donkey."

However, if we read further in the Gospel of Luke, we will see a dramatic change or a mystery hidden here. Continuing with verse 41: "And when He was come near, He beheld the city and wept over it, saying, 'If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes.'" And He explains what is hidden: "For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee. And they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."

Isn't this strange? How is it that everyone is crying out in joy, but the Lord Himself is weeping? He is weeping when He sees Jerusalem. This brings us to the prophecy that the Lord spoke about Jerusalem and the whole world. After this visitation, in about 40 years, Jerusalem will be utterly destroyed, the whole of Judea will be destroyed. Of the Jewish people, one-third will be slain, another third will be enslaved in different countries, and another third will be scattered across the face of the earth. This great tribulation will happen to those who did not recognize the time, the day of their visitation.

Thus, they do not truly understand what the Lord is bringing to them, all these large crowds who are chanting and praising the Lord on this day. Those babies whom the women were holding on that day, who were also chanting, will be around 40 years old in 40 years. They will be the men who will be slain during that final catastrophe, that apocalypse of Jerusalem.

And on that day when more than one million people were in Jerusalem at the time of its destruction, we can imagine the rivers of blood. So, when the women weep as they see Him going to Golgotha a few days after this entrance, He will tell them, "Do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children." For we can understand that when the Lord approaches Jerusalem, He is a prophet. Before His eyes, the future is unveiled; He can see all the tribulation that will come upon Jerusalem. And He also sees that it is His coming that is causing this to happen—it is directly related to His coming.

Sometimes we think that whenever God comes, His blessings bloom, and everything becomes prosperous. But here we see that no, He is coming, He is entering Jerusalem, yet this brings about its final days. Why 40 years? Why is this time needed? Because the Lord is merciful and long-suffering; He gives time for the people to repent. We see that Saint Peter, after Pentecost, delivers public sermons, and thousands of people repent for what they have done. They come and become disciples. Many others convert during these 40 years. However, it is still a minority. Most people choose to cling to the perverted idea of a political messiah and similar notions.

On this day, what people are expecting is that God will bring political sovereignty, economic prosperity, victory over the Romans and all enemies, and earthly glory to Israel. However, God is not so shallow. For Him, different empires, states, political agendas, and geopolitical successes are like garbage. He is concerned about something far more important: the salvation and liberation of humanity from sin and death. His kingdom does not belong to this world. He is the King, and He does want to bring us into His kingdom. Yet, we often fail to understand this.

Even among us, it happens so often that people become upset with God, upset with Christ. I know one girl very well who went to church for many years. She was very pious and a strong believer. She knew everything about the faith, or so it seemed. Then, after many years—perhaps 20—I saw that she had drifted away from the church. When she explained why, she said, "I was doing everything I was supposed to do. I kept the commandments, I went to church, I did all these things. But at the time when I faced a great challenge, a great pain, the Lord did not help." She became upset, and there was a kind of disenchantment. But to avoid becoming disenchanted, we must not be enchanted in the first place. There is always this wrong expectation, this misunderstanding, that my God will come and save me from difficult circumstances. This is similar to the Jews on that day. It is like the Antichrist—it is actually the Antichrist that people are willing to accept.

The Lord says in Psalm 8, "Thou shalt crush the enemy and the avenger." This enemy and avenger is the devil himself. And the Jews who chose not to receive salvation as it came became these enemies and avengers. They had an earthly logic: if such a humble person comes and you strike Him on the right cheek, He will turn the other and pray for His enemies and bless them. Then they will lose the country, they will lose the nation. They had already lost, but they were still afraid of political disadvantage. They had another big plan, which they did not want to abandon.

Very often, we call ourselves Christians. So many people call themselves Christians—hundreds of millions, even Orthodox Christians. Among them, 90% know nothing about the faith. Another 10% come to church but have these wrong expectations—most of us. Only a few understand this mystery, or at least are on the path to understanding it.

It is easy to test whether you are a true Christian or not. Many people say, "I have God in my heart." Well, we have a simple test: if someone strikes you on the right cheek, will you turn the other? Now, we see someone riding a bike too fast, and we get angry. Imagine what would happen if the person comes down and hits you or spits on you. It would likely turn into a scandal. This shows how far we are from being true Christians. Let us think deeply about what has happened.

Another important clue we can draw from today's Gospel, from today's celebration of the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem, is that the end of the world is prophesied by the destruction of Jerusalem. When we see persecutions, great wars in which so many Christians die, or other crises, we know that tribulation is coming. This was clearly seen during the First World War, when Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe and Russia were tormented by war, followed by epidemics, political turmoil, and devastation. The civil war, the Red Terror, the destruction of churches and monasteries, and the desecration of holy places and relics were catastrophic outcomes. The scale of physical death and suffering far exceeded that of Jerusalem. Something similar will happen at the end of the world.

Now, when we hear of wars, pandemics, and other crises, we know that the final days are approaching. The Lord Himself, when He looks at us, will weep, for He will see the final outcome of a world that refuses to receive Him, choosing instead to embrace substitutes. Various heresies and denominations seek to replace the true Christ with a counterfeit idea of Christ—one that tolerates sin and caters to human passions. People say, "I will build a church according to my own vision, create a new church that aligns with my understanding of the Bible, different from everyone else's." This is a selfish concept, a rejection of the true Church, which is meant to transform and nurture us. Instead, people seek a fake Messiah who promises earthly victory and prosperity. This is anti-Christian in nature.

Even among the Orthodox, many have already been swayed by the pursuit of worldly joy and happiness, disregarding the kingdom of the true Messiah, Jesus Christ. Let us think deeply about these things. As these events approach, it is not a time to fear but to be vigilant and prepared. What will matter most is whether we remain loyal and faithful to Christ, even as the world falls into chaos. Let us repent and adjust our hearts so that we may walk with Christ through this Passion Week, living these final days with Him. Let us not grow upset or disappointed but be willing to take up our cross and follow Him to Golgotha.

Our personal Golgotha, whatever it may be that the Lord prepares for us, let us embrace it joyfully and trust fully that there is great purpose in everything we experience each day. We are on this path with Him. Let us put all our effort into spiritual work during these holy days of Passion Week. Just as the Lord sat upon the donkey, which symbolizes conquering the flesh, the material world, and all the sins and passions associated with it, we too must conquer our passions. Spiritually, each time we go through this cycle, we transition from being like a donkey to becoming children of God. This is a great transformation and growth that must take place every year.

As we experience this cycle from Great Lent to Pascha, to Holy Pentecost and the receiving of the Holy Spirit, we must grow closer to the Lord, being liberated from our passions, wrong ideas, sins, and more. May the Lord help us this year to be serious and eager in serving Him, and to pass through to victory with Him. Amen. May the Lord be with every one of you. Have a blessed Passion Week. Amen.
