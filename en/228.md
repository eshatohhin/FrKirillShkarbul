# Is Radicalism the Only Alternative to Ecumenism

Dear brothers and sisters, in the past, I recorded several videos about ecumenism and why it is a heresy that essentially blends all religions together to create a world religion of the Antichrist.  
When people do not care about what they believe, they practically do not care at all.  
Then, of course, they can unite to build Babylon. We call this union "from below."  
When they do not care about faith, they disregard all the teachings of the Church and the spiritual life of the Church, where we clearly see that we believe in one, fully Catholic, and apostolic Church.  
But they disregard all of that. Why? Because of their love for this world, because they do not love the Lord, and because they do not care about how to reach Him.  
If they cared, they would know that there are harmful ways of worshiping and engaging in certain spiritual practices.  
But they do not care, so they say, "Oh, it's all fine, it's all fine. It's one God, so it doesn't matter how you believe or what you believe."  

But today, I do not want to focus on that. This is just a brief introduction. Today, I want to talk about the reaction to this event, to this ecumenism.  
Well, the reaction is also not healthy. Of course, there are people who do not fall into this other extreme.  
The other extreme is radicalism or fundamentalism. It is filled with anger and accusations, always pointing fingers at others, not starting with repentance, not starting with changing oneself, following Christ, or embracing humility.  
Instead, it is the opposite. The devil ensnares these people into this extreme so that they, too, can become blinded and serve as tools for him.  

I respect the basic spirit behind this movement. The fundamental idea is that we do not want to become a melting pot of religions.  
We do not want to lose who we are. We do not want to lose the Church or orthodoxy. We want to stand firm, even if it means being ready to die for the true faith.  
So, the motivation is good, but every good thing can be spoiled. This movement brings forth a very distorted, angry, and perverted type of Christianity that we can call radicalism.  
Recently, with the new wars happening, such as the recent conflict in Israel, this movement has gained traction, and we can see how harmful it is.  
Many people follow it. Just now, if you search on YouTube, you will find a lot of videos like that.  

Today, I want to address a few things about the errors and basic mistakes they make.  
One of the fundamental mistakes is that they embrace what they criticize. They claim that Talmudic and Kabbalistic ideas have entered Christianity and perverted it.  
But they themselves embrace such ideas. For example, in Russia, the largest Orthodox Church among the 15 local churches, they say, "If you are born in Russia, you are Orthodox. This makes you chosen. This makes you special."  
This is nonsense. This is a heresy because it is not being Russian, Serbian, or Greek that makes you a child of Christ or part of the new Israel.  
What matters is your following of Christ, your union with Him, regardless of your nationality or where you were born. It does not matter. If you are humble, if you pray, if you receive Holy Communion, then you are part of the Church and are chosen.  
And this does not mean that you are better than others. This is another point. Yes, the new Israel consists of the chosen people, but they are not chosen in a narrow-minded, fascist mindset.  
We are not chosen because we have "better blood" or are "something special." We do not deserve anything because of who we are. This kind of thinking leads to Nazism, fascism, and an elitist point of view.  
We are not the elite, nor are we inherently superior. So, while they fight against elitist ecumenists, they themselves fall into the same trap.  

Another mistake, which is also Talmudic in nature, is when they say, "Well, this land in Israel is holy for all Christians. This is for all the Orthodox. These are holy places."

"This is our war. What is happening now in the Middle East is our war." No, my friends. While we acknowledge that there are places considered holy, this is very conditional.  
It is not the same as the absolute contrast seen in the Muslim or Jewish world.  
For us, a holy land is blessed by events that occurred there in the past. However, we do not claim that it holds some absolute value that connects us to God in a unique way.  
This is paganism, or perhaps reflective of Old Testament times. But now, the Lord comes to everyone, and wherever He is present, He blesses you and sanctifies the place.  
A church becomes holy because it is dedicated to Him. There are countless places where saints lived, and they did not need to go to Jerusalem to become holy or to touch sacred stones.  
No, as the holy Saint Seraphim said, "Here, where you are in this forest, it can be for you Jerusalem, Rome, Constantinople—all the holy places are here, as long as you are with the Lord."  
This is reflected in Christ's words: "From now on, you will not worship in this temple or that temple. You will worship everywhere, in truth and spirit, for such are the worshippers the Father seeks."  
Therefore, we should not fall into this pagan idea that draws us into conflicts. This is not our war. We should not be drawn into it.  

This is another significant mistake. Another error they make is claiming that if you live a righteous life, follow Christ, repent, and become a good Christian, all your problems will be solved.  
For example, they might say about Russia—or other countries like Bulgaria or Romania—that it is controlled by oligarchs, occupied by Jews, or losing territory to the Chinese in Siberia. They claim that the country is lost because of sin.  
They argue that if everyone repents and follows Christ, the nation will regain its greatness, prosperity, and everything will be restored.  
This is a heresy because Christ never promised His disciples earthly prosperity, good health, or material blessings in exchange for following Him.  
This is an anti-Christian idea, rooted in Talmudic thinking, which equates blessings with material wealth, longevity, and success. It is not that simple.  
There is no direct link between righteousness and earthly prosperity. These people fall into deeply flawed ideas marked by paganism, Talmudism, hatred, and accusations—blaming everyone but themselves.  

This mindset often leads to Judeophobia, where all the world's problems are blamed on Jews, claiming they control everything.  
This is a vast topic, but generally speaking, there are millions of ordinary Jewish people—some by nationality, others by religion—who are no different from any other nation.  
If certain groups have harmful teachings or disproportionate influence, that is a separate issue. But it is wrong to blame all Jews collectively.  
Every nation has its unique characteristics, and the Jewish people are no exception. Whether they are defined as a nation or a religion is another discussion.  
I do not want to delve into this now, but it is incorrect to blame all problems on Jews and claim they are the root of everything.  
This is completely irrational, and we know that figures like Hitler and the Nazis were as far from Christianity as possible.  
Let us not fall into such traps.

However, people without education, without spiritual life, and without love—a Christian who does not have love is not a Christian.  
You are supposed to love everyone. If you dislike certain people or nations, that is not Christian.  
We can disagree with some religious dogmas that are wrong, but we never blame people for that. We blame demons, sin, and wrong philosophies.  
But we do not say, "These people are bad." No, we never say that. People are all good.  
They are created by God, but sometimes they do bad things. We must separate the person from their actions. This is a crucial distinction.  

There are many other errors and mistakes they make—too many to list.  
So, to conclude today, if we want to be good Christians, it should not be a reaction to some negative phenomenon.  
Following Christ is not a reaction against something. When Jesus called His disciples, He did not say, "You see how bad the Romans are, so you need to follow Me."  
He never said that. He also did not say, "You see how bad the scribes and Pharisees are, so follow Me."  
He never said that. In fact, He taught them to obey the moral teachings of the Pharisees and scribes but not to imitate their actions, because they said the right things but did not practice them.  

This is another problem. Following Christ must come from love. It must come from a deep encounter with Him.  
And it must bear fruit—the fruits of faith, which are love, patience, humility, prayer, trust in the Lord, compassion for others, and forgiveness.  
These are the fruits of a life rooted in Christ—a life detached from the material world and detached from politics.  

So, let us be with Christ. Let us be wise. Let us be humble. Let us pray for all the people who are suffering now.  
Let us not be overly troubled by political agendas or other distractions that aim to make us worried, nervous, irritated, or angry. These are the devil's goals.  

Instead, let us focus on spiritual life—on prayer, on receiving Holy Communion, on reading the Holy Gospel, and on living according to the Holy Gospel.  
This will guide us out of every trap and every mistake.  

May the Lord help all of you and bless you. Amen.
