# The world slips into Dark Ages

Dear brothers and sisters, I have returned from Polynesia to this world, and after spending a few days in the United States, I have now come to Canada, where I currently am. During my travels, I have met with many people and observed how they perceive the world and the events unfolding around us. This has given me a fresh perspective, and I wish to share some thoughts with you about what is happening on a spiritual level and how we can confront the reality we are facing today.

The reality is that we are living in dark times, akin to the dark ages. The world we have known is being dismantled, and there is an attempt to build a new world. This new world, however, is shaping up to be increasingly anti-Christian. It will resemble, in many ways, the Orwellian world described by George Orwell—a world where democracy exists, but in a form that is more oppressive and less aligned with Christian values. In this new world, there will be less and less room for Christ, for true Christianity. I have seen churches being dismantled in downtown Toronto, and everywhere, there is a pervasive anti-Christian propaganda. These are clear signs of the times we are living in.

Today, I do not have the time to delve into every aspect of this situation, but one major aspect is the fear that has been instilled in people over the past two and a half years. People have been forced to submit to various orders, and in a sense, humanity has been "hacked." This process of hacking humanity has occurred in stages. Even the Western church, the Roman church, has slipped into heresy, contributing to this process. Satan offers a concept, an idea, and people take the bait, falling into temptation.

At each stage of this process, we can also see the providence of God. God allows these things to happen so that we may learn from them. However, the majority of people have succumbed to these temptations, drifting further and further away from God. This alienation from God is what will eventually pave the way for the rise of the anti-Christ, as people willingly distance themselves from God.

So, what is happening now? After this recent "hacking" of humanity over the past two and a half years, people are now more susceptible to accepting absurd ideas. We see this in the current state of the world—wars, fears of hunger, economic collapse, and other crises. People are now ready to accept any message that is implanted in their minds. The world is going mad, embracing ideas that would have been unthinkable in the past.

Everything you do is now controlled, with all your information—medical, biomedical, and more—stored somewhere. Your ID, your second identity, your avatar, has been created for you. Transhumanism is on the rise, with artificial intelligence replacing many human functions in society. People are now ready to embrace all of this, and it is happening on a massive scale.

Moreover, people have been implanted with many crazy ideas. Those who were once cautious about political decisions are now clamoring for more weapons, more death, and more violence. In just a matter of weeks, people have completely changed.

All of this madness is a clear indication that we are living in dark ages. Humanity is being hacked on a profound level. This intelligence knows everything about you—your preferences, behavior, shopping habits, and interests. You are categorized into a segment of society, and your actions are predictable based on your education, social status, job, income, and ethnicity. You are being measured and calculated, becoming a tool, an instrument of the great Leviathan, the Prince of this World, as the Lord called it.

So now the Prince of this World has gained unprecedented ways of controlling and infiltrating human hearts, souls, and minds—methods that were never seen before, not even under totalitarian regimes like Hitler's or North Korea's. Those regimes were mere toys compared to the system that is emerging today. This new world is a totalitarian one where people will believe they are free and happy, but in reality, they will be completely hacked and fully integrated into the system. We are not there yet, but we are heading in that direction.

In these dark times, what should we do? How should we view ourselves and the events unfolding around us? I believe there are three key aspects to understand about any dark age. First, dark times are not new. We have faced them many times before, though now they are on a global scale and far more profound than in the past. Still, we can learn from history. For example, during the time of Golgotha, even in the Garden of Gethsemane, on that dark night before His crucifixion, the Lord prayed. He asked God the Father to take the chalice of suffering away from Him, but the Father did not. Later, on Golgotha, the Lord cried out, *"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"*—"My God, my God, why have You forsaken Me?" This moment reflects one aspect of dark ages: it can feel as though God has abandoned His people.

Today, we see many clergy and priests also being "hacked" by certain ideas. People who expect to hear truth from the Church instead hear the same propaganda they read in newspapers. The Church, which is meant to be separate from the world, is increasingly infiltrated and controlled by worldly influences. At times, it may seem as though there is no way out, as if God has left us and the Prince of this World is in complete control. This feeling of abandonment is a hallmark of dark times.

The second aspect of dark ages is that they are a time of completion, a time when evil ripens to its fullest extent. Just as the hatred of those who opposed God grew to the point where they crucified the Messiah, we see a similar maturity of evil today. People who once thought rationally and made sound judgments are now consumed by propaganda, embracing hatred, violence, and agendas that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. This is a sign of the times—a sign that evil is reaching its peak.

The third and perhaps most important aspect for each of us is that dark times, times of temptation, are also times when the Lord grants His glory to those who withstand these trials. The Lord Himself was crucified and entered into His glory on Golgotha. Similarly, the martyrs received their reward from the Lord on the day they were martyred, when darkness seemed to close in around them. In the same way, those who remain faithful during these dark times will be granted the crown of glory. 

So, in these dark ages, we must hold fast to our faith, resist the temptations of the world, and trust that the Lord is with us, even when it feels as though He has abandoned us. This is the time to stand firm, to remain vigilant, and to prepare ourselves for the glory that awaits those who endure.

That is the time when they received their reward. The same applies to us now. What we do now, how we withstand these temptations, will determine our reward. If we are able to do something for the Lord during this time of trial, darkness, and even perceived abandonment, we will receive a great reward from Him. This is the third and most crucial aspect of the dark times we are facing.

With that in mind, I want to highlight two things that each of us should focus on during these dark times. First, we must not be swayed by the agendas of the world—economic crises, political turmoil, social unrest, or spiritual troubles. We should not obsess over the news, worry about where the Antichrist is coming from, or become consumed by the chaos around us. Instead, we should let these things run their course, especially when we are not in a position to effect large-scale change. However, on a micro level, each of us can make a significant difference. We can focus on our personal ministry to the Lord, no matter how small it may seem. Whether it’s serving our family, excelling in our work, participating in church ministry, or engaging in mission work or studies, we must ask ourselves: *What can I do today for the Lord?* We are called to be His instruments, not instruments of the Devil or the Prince of this World. Therefore, we must remain focused, avoiding despondency, lack of faith, and hopelessness. We are soldiers of Christ, and every day we must ask how we can serve Him here and now, even if it means sacrificing ourselves for others. This is the first thing we must remember.

The second thing is that, in order to serve the Lord effectively, we must strive to be spiritually autonomous and free from the world’s influence. We must not allow ourselves to be polluted or controlled by the world, despite the constant propaganda, noise, and influence of those around us. Christ taught us that the Kingdom of God is within us. This is our calling—to carry the Kingdom of Heaven in our hearts, making us autonomous from the world’s attempts to control us. The problem, however, is that none of us is yet fully free. We are all, to some extent, "hacked" by the world. I include myself in this. I am being honest when I say that I, too, am affected. But I am striving to receive healing, to overcome the consequences of being hacked, and to grow stronger in the Lord.

We can either remain in a state of being hacked—controlled by wrong mindsets, psychological trauma, sins, and passions—or we can actively seek revival, striving to put things back together with the Lord’s help and grace. To do this, we must focus on our spiritual lives: prayer, fighting against passions and sin, reading the writings of the holy fathers, and progressing in spiritual strength. Only by focusing on these two things—our ministry to the Lord and our spiritual autonomy—can we hope to withstand the temptations of this age and receive salvation.

The Lord Himself said that at the time of His second coming, there will be two women working in the field: one will be taken, and the other will remain. This means that it is not enough simply to work or to be busy. Both women were working, but only one was prepared. It is not about merely being active; it is about being spiritually ready, focused on the Lord, and free from the world’s grip. Let us, therefore, strive to be among those who are taken, who are ready, and who have remained faithful to the Lord in these dark times.

So it is not enough simply to work or to be focused on doing something. No, what truly matters is dedicating everything we do to the Lord, allowing His grace to work through us. We must build with Him, preparing the way for His Kingdom to be established in our hearts. Everything we do—whether serving the Church, uniting with the body and blood of Jesus Christ, or living out our daily lives—must be done with the purpose of glorifying Him and advancing His Kingdom. Only then will we attain salvation and be brought into His eternal glory.

Let us, therefore, put forth every effort to remain unpolluted, undefiled, and uncorrupted by this fallen world. We must resist the evil, hatred, and brainwashing that surrounds us, striving instead to stay pure and focused on the Lord. May the Lord be with each of you, strengthening you in faith and guiding you in His ways. Amen. God bless.
