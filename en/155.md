# How can we receive the Holy Spirit

Dear brothers and sisters, we are now in a very special time between the Ascension of the Lord, which was last Thursday, and Pentecost, which is coming this Sunday. During these ten days, we are expecting the descent of the Holy Spirit. We are in a period of intense anticipation, joining in prayer with the apostles who were sent by the Lord from Jerusalem. After His Ascension, He essentially told them, "Go back to Jerusalem and wait there for the Holy Spirit, who will baptize you. You will be baptized in the Holy Spirit, and you will become my witnesses to the ends of the earth."

So, they went and prayed, and this is what the Church is experiencing now. We are living through these days, contemplating and reflecting more deeply on the Holy Spirit. What does it mean to receive the Holy Spirit? Often, we think of the Holy Spirit as something distant—where is the Holy Spirit in relation to me? Yes, there are saints who have halos behind their heads, who are holy in their lives and hearts, who converse with God and perform miracles. But what about me? I cannot do those things. I am just a mortal, a regular person. I believe in Christ, but my life doesn’t differ much from those who don’t believe. I try to do better, but I am still very sinful and limited. If we are honest with ourselves, we see many limitations within us.

As a result, many people distance themselves from this topic. They think, "The Holy Spirit belongs to theology, to ancient times. But I am not even ascetic. I can’t fast. How can I be filled with the Holy Spirit?" This is a misunderstanding. Today, we will see why this way of thinking is wrong. We should not think like that. Each of us, if we have chosen to follow Christ, is already in a relationship with the Holy Spirit. That connection already exists.

Another misunderstanding is viewing the Holy Spirit as a physical energy or force. Yes, it is spiritual—you cannot see it—but it is often thought of as something that fills us, giving us a boost or a feeling of peace, tranquility, or heavenly joy in our hearts. This understanding can also be misleading because it tends to make the Holy Spirit too physical, almost like a material force that we simply cannot see. In reality, the Spirit is none of that. It belongs to another reality, another dimension. We cannot express it in terms of physical things or feelings, nor can we describe it in rational terms. It is beyond that.

Today, I want to explore how we can penetrate this mystery and gain a better understanding of the Holy Spirit, as well as how we can receive the Holy Spirit in different stages of our spiritual lives. This will help us progress in our reception of and union with the Holy Spirit. What are we expecting now? Is this just a tradition, something we are symbolically anticipating? Or is it a real expectation, a real event that will happen on Pentecost for each of us?

To understand this, let’s take a closer look. On one end of the spectrum, I’ve described the idea that I am separate from the Holy Spirit. Another mistake is when people think, "Oh, everything is the Holy Spirit. I am joyful today—this is the Holy Spirit. I understand how to fix my car—this is the Holy Spirit." Or, "My plants are growing—this is by the Holy Spirit." And so on. No, the Holy Spirit is not like that either. We must avoid both extremes. Otherwise, we risk slipping into paganism, where God is seen as everything and everywhere, or as nature itself—a teaching associated with Spinoza.

And actually, many of these so-called occultists and people who, some believe, are ruling the world are Spinozists. Some people think this way and want everyone to become Spinozists. Therefore, we need to be careful about this pantheistic understanding. Let’s think more deeply about the Holy Spirit.

To give us some reference points, let’s turn to Isaiah 11, verse 2. From this chapter, we see that there are seven spirits, and we know that the lampstand on the altar in the church has seven lamps. These seven lamps represent the seven spirits or seven angels mentioned in Revelation, who are sent to the seven churches. This is all interconnected. These seven spirits can be thought of as seven aspects, seven gifts, or seven ways the Holy Spirit expresses itself. We become partakers of the Holy Spirit through one or more of these seven ways. So, what are they?

I won’t read the text verbatim, but I will explain it in a way that helps us understand. There are seven spirits: the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the Spirit of might, the Spirit of knowledge, and the Spirit of the fear of God. These are seven ways of describing the Holy Spirit or seven aspects of its work. We won’t delve deeply into each one, but we can see that the Holy Spirit influences us and allows us to partake in its gifts through these various expressions.

For example, take the Spirit of might. When the might of the Lord, His almighty power, comes upon someone, they are empowered—not to become almighty themselves, but through faith, they can bring change to the world. Through prayer, some people are healed. Through the prayers of the apostles and holy people, demons are cast out. When we talk about the powers manifested through saints, this is the Spirit of might at work.

When we speak of the Spirit of knowledge, this refers to a deep understanding, the knowledge of God. It is a *vedini*—a knowing, a penetrating insight that enables us to make decisions, especially regarding the mysteries of the Lord. Each of these spirits represents a facet of the gifts of the Holy Spirit that we often discuss. In the writings of the Apostle Paul, he describes various gifts: some are called to be teachers, preachers, prophets, or those responsible for acts of mercy and charity. He gives advice for every kind of ministry within the church, including pastoral ministry. These gifts of the Spirit manifest in many different ways. Paul also encourages us to seek greater gifts, saying, “Eagerly desire the greater gifts, and I will show you the most excellent way” (1 Corinthians 12:31). If we desire more of the Holy Spirit’s gifts, the Lord will grant them, and we will appreciate them. But we must have a genuine longing for these gifts and recognize that they are not reserved solely for saints.

We can also talk about different levels of belonging to the Holy Spirit, or stages in the life of the Spirit. The first level is when we receive Christ as God, as our Savior, and decide to follow Him, aiming to be with Him in the Kingdom of Heaven. When we set this goal and make this commitment, the Holy Spirit touches our hearts. It is only through the Holy Spirit that this decision can be made. This is why, in last week’s Gospel, we heard about the blind man who was born blind and came to recognize Christ as the Messiah, while the Pharisees, scribes, and high priests—despite their education, prayers, rituals, and outward righteousness—did not believe. Today, some people say, “Oh, all religions are the same,” but this is not true. True faith and the work of the Holy Spirit go beyond external practices; they transform the heart and lead us to a personal relationship with Christ.

They had the most religious zeal, the most eagerness in performing rituals and even living what appeared to be righteous lives in terms of keeping the commandments. Yet, none of that saved them. Their actions had no true connection to the Holy Spirit. They were not directly related to the Holy Spirit, which is why they could not understand the prophets or grasp the true meaning of the Scriptures. They studied the books, memorized them, and researched them, but it did not help. Their understanding was blocked. They even witnessed the evident miracles performed by the Lord, yet they still refused to accept Him. They were against Him. This was because they lacked the gift of the Holy Spirit, which the blind man possessed. This is not a small or trivial matter. No, this is a great gift, and it already places us in a relationship with the Holy Spirit. So, do not think that the Holy Spirit is far from you. If you have made the decision to follow the Lord and desire to be with Him, you are already connected to the Holy Spirit.

However, this is not enough. It is a good beginning and absolutely necessary, but it is not sufficient. We all know that we are inconsistent—we waver, going back and forth. One day we feel eager to serve the Lord, and the next we are downcast, depressed, or fall victim to sinful passions. We struggle with loneliness, laziness, attachment to the material world, a lack of faith, and fears. All of this shows that we are still lacking much and are at risk of falling away from Christ. Therefore, the next level of receiving the Holy Spirit is when we can remain in Christ continuously—when we can be with the Lord all the time, from morning to evening, in everything we do, as the Apostle Paul says, "Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). This is the task for most of us, perhaps 99% of the faithful. We are not yet at the level where we can be continuously with the Lord, constantly overcoming selfishness, thinking about how to serve Him and His people, and maintaining that mindset. We must discard not only our sinful will but also our wrong values and beliefs. Overcoming these is a great gift of the Holy Spirit, the next level of spiritual growth.

During this time before Pentecost, this is what we are praying for—that the Lord will help us overcome these struggles and become firmer in our faith. And, of course, there are even higher levels beyond this. When we receive the gift of being always in Christ, always humble, we can ask for more. We can ask the Lord to reveal His will in everything we do, even in our daily decisions. Should I do this or that? We should not wait for the Lord to correct us through hardship, such as sickness, before we understand His will. Instead, He wants us to progress to the level where the Holy Spirit guides us directly, saying, "Do this, do that." This is a much higher level, and I am not there yet. This is for very spiritual people who have reached a deep level of communion with God. But we should still be aware that there is more.

Beyond this, there are even greater gifts—direct revelations, prophecies, visions, and many other things that are still possible. There is nothing impossible for the Lord, even in our day and age. However, we must proceed step by step. We should not simply dream about revelations or extraordinary spiritual experiences. Instead, we must focus on the foundational steps: deepening our relationship with Christ, growing in humility, and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives. Only then can we progress toward the higher gifts and deeper union with God.

We need to stabilize ourselves on the path of righteousness. If we stand firm in faith, many talents will begin to unfold within us—talents for teaching, caring for others, prayer, and various other gifts. The seeds of faith planted within us will grow, bloom, and bear fruit. This is what will happen as we progress spiritually. The second stage of spiritual growth is something we must aim for. We must not relax or become complacent until we reach this level, and even after we attain it, we must not grow idle. However, we should not despair or feel that this level is unattainable for us. We can and must reach it. We ask the Lord to send us the Holy Spirit so that He may be with us, and we may abide in Him at this second level. This will not happen because we are exceptionally good or extraordinarily strong in prayer. It will be a gift, a grace given to us. But we must learn to value this gift and not take it for granted.

We should not think of the Holy Spirit in terms of "either we have it or we don’t." If we constantly believe we don’t have it, we risk falling into a profane way of living, giving sanction to sin. This is a significant problem that has affected the Church—the idea that there is a natural world and a supernatural world, and that only saints can access the supernatural. No, it is natural for a Christian to live a holy life, to abide in Christ at all times, to have no "garbage" in the soul, and to keep the Lord dwelling within. The Holy Spirit is not distant or reserved for a select few; it is meant to transform every aspect of our lives.

Let us pray that the Lord strengthens us and grants us the gift of the Holy Spirit so that we may partake in His life, bring His life to those around us, and become His witnesses even to the ends of the earth. May the Lord bless us this Pentecost and fill us with His Spirit, guiding us ever closer to Him. Amen.
