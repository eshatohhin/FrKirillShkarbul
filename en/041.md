# We’ve abandoned “first love”. What we can learn from the Early Church

Dear brothers and sisters, we have entered a new year, and this is a good opportunity for us to renew our spiritual lives. When someone wants to renew their life, they sometimes need external motivation. They might change their home environment, cut their hair, and feel that a new life has begun. Similarly, we need to renew our spiritual lives. Why do we need to do this? We should use this new year as a time to embrace new opportunities, set new goals, and establish spiritual objectives. But why is it necessary to set these goals? What is lacking in our current spiritual state?

Let us turn to the Book of Revelation, specifically chapter 2. In this passage, the Lord Jesus Christ instructs Saint Apostle John to write to the angels of seven churches. These angels represent the entire church, and their messages hold important lessons for each of us. What does Christ say to the first church, the church of Ephesus? Let us examine this closely.

He says, "And to the angel of the church of Ephesus write, 'You have borne and have had patience, and for my name's sake have labored and have not fainted; nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.'"

This passage warns us that if we remain as we are, having lost our first love—our initial fervor and devotion to Christ—we risk losing our spiritual vitality. Today, we often focus on external aspects of faith: the timing of celebrations, the decoration of churches, and other outward expressions. These externalities can indicate that we have lost our true love for Christ. This is the message Christ conveyed to the church of Ephesus, and it is a message for us as well.

If we do not return to the fervor of the early church—the time of the apostles—we risk losing our spiritual foundation. The early church loved God deeply, sacrificing their lives, possessions, and time for ministry, prayer, and serving others selflessly. In contrast, today we often see selfishness and personal interests taking precedence. This is not how it should be. If we do not repent and return to a life of wholehearted love for Christ, our "candlestick" will be removed. What does this mean? It signifies that we will lose God's blessings, His help, support, and guidance. We may even become worse than pagans who do not yet know Christ, for we have known Him and turned away. This is a grave warning.

Let us reflect deeply on these words and strive to invest more effort into our spiritual lives. Today, I also want to address the negative influences we face. We must influence the world, not let the world influence us. In Old Testament times, the chosen people of Israel were protected by God and instructed not to associate with pagan nations. Even speaking with them or touching them rendered one unclean. Marrying a pagan meant exclusion from the chosen people. These strict rules existed in a simpler time, when society was more natural and less chaotic than today.

Now, we are surrounded by spiritual garbage—distractions in how people dress, live, and speak. The Lord protected Israel from such influences, and we, too, must guard ourselves against the corrupting forces of the world. Let us remain steadfast in our faith and strive to live as Christ calls us to live.

The reason for this strict separation in the Old Testament was that the faith of the Israelites was not yet strong enough. Even though we read about heroes of the Old Testament who conquered nations and drove away foreign armies, their faith, while strong, was not spiritually mature enough to bear witness to the one true God or to engage with other cultures without being corrupted. This highlights the immense spiritual power that was later given to the church when it was established. The church was entrusted with the mission to spread the gospel to every nation, not to absorb the filth of the world but to transform it with the light and life of Christ.

This mission required a profound spiritual strength, rooted in the church's love for Christ and its willingness to sacrifice itself for His sake. This is not optional for us today. As we see in Revelation, the Lord will withdraw His blessing and grace if we fail to live with the same fervor and dedication as the early church. We must hold ourselves to the same high standard of spiritual life, refusing to compromise or lower our expectations.

Let us reflect deeply on this and make the necessary adjustments in our lives. If we have not yet reached this level of spiritual maturity, we must at least protect ourselves from the spiritual garbage that surrounds us. The church of Christ is often depicted in Revelation as an unblemished bride, pure and without stain. This is how every Christian's soul and the entire church should be. If we still struggle with moral or relational issues, these must be addressed and cleansed. Anything that hinders God's grace and blessing in our lives must be uprooted and discarded.

Let us strive for purity of soul, free from blemish or stain, so that we may receive the Lord's mighty support, guidance, and courage to speak His truth and bear witness to His gospel. We must also help others who are trapped in spiritual filth, whether they are part of religious sects or immersed in worldly distractions. Many people are like those swimming in a dirty pool, unaware of the filth because they are accustomed to it. As followers of Christ, we must help them recognize the impurity of their surroundings and guide them to the true source of light, inspiration, and power—Christ Himself.

Let us have the knowledge and boldness to begin this renewal within ourselves and extend it to the world in this new year. May the Lord bless you and grant you His grace as you strive to live a life worthy of His calling. Amen.
