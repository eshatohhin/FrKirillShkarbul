# Four Modes of Consciousness How to live “with God”

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about spiritual life, specifically about the four types of conscience. This is very important if we want to learn vigilance and how to escape from all kinds of temptations and delusions, how to live in the presence of the Lord at all times, and how to rise above our normal fallen state of mind and conscience.

For most people, prayer might simply involve reading from a book—perhaps a prayer book—but their conscience remains the same as if they were brushing their teeth, taking out the garbage, washing their car, or performing some other mundane task. It becomes a routine: "Okay, now I'm supposed to read, so I'll read this prayer book." This is why we often find our minds wandering. We say we're distracted, that we can't focus on prayer. But why is this the case? The reason is that we operate on a level of consciousness that is profane, fallen, and ordinary—what we might call an apostatic level of consciousness.

When I use the term "consciousness," please don't think I'm referring to some specialized philosophical concept or a theory from anthropology or psychology. I simply mean it in the everyday sense: being aware of something. You'll understand what I mean by these four levels of consciousness through the examples I’ll provide.

Our task in spiritual life is to ascend to these higher levels of consciousness, eventually reaching the highest level—though, to be clear, the four levels I’ll discuss today are just a basic introduction. The reality is more nuanced, both complicated and simple at the same time. Today, I’ll focus on these four levels, as I think that’s enough for one video.

The Lord said, "Be vigilant and pray, lest you fall into temptation." And in the Lord’s Prayer, we say, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." What does this vigilance, this soberness, mean? Soberness is the state of being spiritually awake, not drunk. In the language of ascetics, the whole world is considered drunk—even if you’re not physically intoxicated, you are spiritually asleep unless you’ve been awakened. Today, we’ll discuss what this awakeness is, how to achieve it, how to remain in it, and how to distinguish true awakeness from false or counterfeit forms of enlightenment. I’ve spoken about this before, and if you’re interested, you can revisit my earlier video on the mind and reasoning, which I posted a few months ago.

What I’m going to discuss applies to all aspects of life, not just prayer. Whether you’re talking to people, reading the Gospel or any other book, engaging in ministry, working, or laboring—at any moment, you could be operating in one of these modes. Today, I’ll talk about these four modes. Most of us, most of the time, operate in what I call the rationalistic mode. Sometimes we may switch between modes, but the rationalistic mode is our default state. What do I mean by this? The rationalistic mode means that you logically comprehend what is happening around you.

The best way to understand these modes is through the example of prayer. Let’s use prayer to explore three of the four levels of consciousness I want to introduce today. The most basic level is rationalistic consciousness.

It is when we read a prayer book—let’s say we take a prayer book and read it—but our attention is elsewhere. We’re thinking about other things: when we’ll have lunch, whether we’ve turned off the lights in our room, what’s going to happen in a few hours, or the noise outside. We’re distracted, yet we continue reading the prayer book. We finish with "Amen," but we don’t really know what we’ve just read. I think all of us have experienced this at some point.

What does this mean? It means that we’ve read the words automatically, mechanically. We understand the meaning of each word, but our reason and attention are elsewhere. This is the rationalistic, mechanical mode of thinking, where our reason—our ability to process information logically—is disconnected from our full attention. In Greek, this rational ability is called *logikki*; in Latin, it’s *ratio*. The task, then, is to unite our reason and our rational ability. How do we know when they’re united? There are three signs:

1. **Full attention**: You are fully focused on what you’re doing.  
2. **Moral judgment**: You understand the moral value of your actions—whether something is good or bad.  
3. **Comprehensive understanding**: You grasp the totality of what’s in front of you, whether it’s a sentence in a prayer or any other task. You see the big picture and the essence of what you’re doing.  

When these three elements are present—full attention, moral judgment, and comprehensive understanding—it means your reason is engaged. This is the second level of consciousness, where we are more whole and less dispersed. However, this is still not enough. There is a higher level of consciousness, which I’ll now discuss.

The highest level of consciousness in prayer is what we call the *prayer of the mind*. But this "mind" is not the secular understanding of the mind. It is the *nous*—a spiritual concept. In ascetic vocabulary, the *nous* is the spiritual aspect of the human soul, often referred to as the "eye of the heart." This eye can see God; it was created by God for this purpose—to perceive the divine, the heavenly, and the kingdom of heaven. The *nous* is entirely oriented toward the heavens.  

When the *nous* is present in prayer, it signifies a deeper, spiritual awareness. This is not about intellectual reasoning or logical comprehension but about a direct, intuitive connection with the divine. The *nous* allows us to transcend the rationalistic mode and enter into a state of spiritual awakeness, where we are fully present before God. This is the highest level of consciousness in prayer, where the heart and mind are united in communion with the divine.  

To summarize, the rationalistic mode is the most basic level, where we mechanically perform tasks without full attention or moral awareness. The second level involves uniting reason and rational ability, leading to full attention, moral judgment, and comprehensive understanding. The highest level, the *prayer of the mind*, engages the *nous*—the spiritual eye of the heart—allowing us to see and commune with God. This is the goal of spiritual life: to ascend from the mechanical and rationalistic to the spiritual and divine.

The more the *nous* (the spiritual mind) opens and is recovered within you, the less you are preoccupied with the cares of this earthly world. This doesn’t mean you escape the world, but you place less value on it because the kingdom of heaven is already opening before you. As the Apostle Paul said, "Those who use the things of the world, [should live] as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away" (1 Corinthians 7:31). If you lose something, don’t be overly sorrowful; if you gain something, don’t be overly joyful about earthly things. Why? Because the kingdom of heaven is already unfolding before us. We stand in the presence of the Lord’s glory, and this can only be comprehended by the *nous*, the spiritual mind. In Hebrew, this is called *neshama*—the breath of God, the divine breath given to every human being.

The problem is that through sin, we have become profane, earthly, and materialistic. For most people, the ability to perceive spiritual reality is rare and fleeting. Sometimes, we may feel a glimpse of the spiritual—a sense that it comes from the Lord—but it quickly departs, and we return to our profane, secular mindset. The task, then, is to always see God before us, to remain in constant dialogue with Him, to understand His will, and to see ourselves within His divine providence. We must recognize that this world is ruled by God, not by chance, bad people, or unfavorable circumstances. This is a deeply mystical understanding, but it begins to open up to those who recover the consciousness of the *nous*.

When the consciousness of the *nous* is restored, it works in harmony with our rational consciousness. The *nous* perceives spiritual realities, while our reason helps us process, summarize, and draw conclusions from these experiences. Reason aids us in preserving this spiritual state, avoiding harmful situations, and dealing rightly with the challenges we encounter in the world.

Let’s return to the example of prayer. Once we’ve recovered our reasoning—when our full attention is on the prayer, when we understand what we’re reading and to whom we’re directing our prayer—the next step is to truly experience the reality that we are speaking to God. It’s not just about reciting words; it’s about recognizing that God is present, listening, and that we are opening our hearts and minds to Him. This is a deeply intimate and vital part of our spiritual life. This level of prayer is already very high.

Now, let’s discuss the fourth level of consciousness, which is below the rational level. For example, consider driving a car. You can drive mechanically, almost automatically, while thinking about something else, listening to music, or processing other information. Your rational mind is still functioning—you know when to turn, when to stop—but your attention is split. However, if you’re drunk, your rational ability is impaired, and you’re likely to cause an accident. Similarly, when a passion overtakes you—such as anger—you might act irrationally, doing something harmful or even irreversible. This is sub-rational behavior, driven by impulses that bypass reason and lead to destructive actions.

In summary, the recovery of the *nous* elevates us above earthly concerns, allowing us to perceive the kingdom of heaven. This spiritual awareness works in harmony with our rational mind, guiding us to live rightly in the world. The highest level of prayer involves not just understanding but experiencing the presence of God. Below the rational level lies the sub-rational, where passions and impulses can lead us astray. The goal is to rise above this, uniting reason and spirit in communion with God.

It can also be irrational in a good sense, but let’s leave that aside for now. What we’re focusing on here is irrationality in a bad sense—when passions pull us toward sinful and destructive actions. In such moments, we fall even below the level of animals. Even animals possess a basic rationality: they know when to run from danger, when to jump, and how to survive. Their rationality is simpler than ours, but it’s still present. Humans, however, can descend even lower when the "beast" within us awakens—when those "snakes" of passion emerge and drag us toward sin, perversion, or other destructive behaviors. This is when people become demon-possessed, commit suicide, or fall into dark, harmful situations. They lose their lives, harm their loved ones, and become instruments of the devil. Of course, one can also serve as an instrument of the devil while operating on a rational level, but we don’t have time to delve into that now.

To summarize, today we’ve discussed the four levels of consciousness. Our goal is to reach the level of *mind consciousness*—where, in everything we do, we see God before us and comprehend His will. Whether we’re talking to someone, reading the Gospel, participating in divine services, or working, we remain spiritually vigilant. We are not split or mechanical in our actions, nor do we let time slip away as our minds wander. Instead, we are fully responsible, aware of where we are and what we’re doing. We are the Lord’s servants, standing guard in a spiritual battle, overthrowing the enemy, and remaining in a state of spiritual victory. This is the consciousness of the *nous*.

However, reaching this level is not something we can achieve on our own. It is always a gift from the Lord—a form of healing and recovery granted by Him. It is a talent bestowed upon us, but we must first recognize our fallen state, our need for salvation, and our dependence on Christ’s healing. When He deems it appropriate, He will grant us this recovery, making us strong warriors for His glory.

Let us reflect deeply on the wisdom passed down to us by spiritual fathers and shepherds—those who have struggled against evil forces, their own fallen nature, and their passions. They have given us this precious understanding of spiritual life, which we can now apply. May the Lord help us on this path, enabling us to recover not only our reasoning and rationality but, most importantly, our *nous*—our spirit, our *neshamah*—so that we may always remain with Him, no matter where we are or what we are doing. May this be so. God bless. Amen.
