# Why there is “neither Jew, nor Greek.. in Christ” How is this possible

Dear brothers and sisters, during this time of separation, war, and conflicts in the world—within the church and in society—we face all kinds of problems that we’ve been told about: social, ethnic, and various other issues. Peaceful life, as we once knew it, is over. It is good to talk about the division and unity that we gain in Christ. And we have some experience with that because, in this parish, we have people from all over the world. We have Taiwanese, Americans, Russians, Ukrainians, Filipinos, Georgians, Greeks—people from different places, different social positions. What I will be talking about will also draw from the experience we have here: the experience of gradually becoming one family in Christ—not just one family, but becoming one in Christ.

First, let us take a look at what the Apostle Paul tells us. These are basic yet profoundly important things, but we often depart from them, and that’s why we see all the division in this world. In his letter to the Galatians, chapter 3, verses 27 to 29, Apostle Paul writes:  
*"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise."*  

Apostle Paul is telling us that once we are baptized into Christ, we "put on Christ." What does it mean to "put on Christ"? He further explains this. Essentially, our essence, our spiritual self-identity, and the content of our personality become Christ Himself. And since He is one, we are one. Everything else is external to that. Whether we are Russians, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese—all these things are not relevant; they are secondary, and perhaps not even secondary. They do not determine who we are or what we are. Our social position—whether we are big businessmen, holy guards, kings, queens, slaves, proletariats, peasants, or even homeless—also does not mean much.  

You see, for the Lord, if you can see that in your soul there is Christ, this becomes more precious. Even if you are a peasant, or if you have no social position, or if you are a complete failure in terms of social status—if you have no resume because you have nothing to write, if you are socially nothing, with no money and only debts—you are closer to God and more precious to Him than kings, oligarchs, or very influential people who own newspapers and everything else. You are more precious and important to the Lord than they are at this moment. Not more important in a comparative sense, but you carry more honor and blessing from the Lord. And this is not your achievement or your credit; it is the Lord’s grace that has brought you to this state, to this situation.  

So we see that nation, history, and culture are secondary. Your social status, your class—whether proletariat or otherwise—is secondary. Wars happen because of these divisions: wars between nations, wars between different classes, strikes, and all kinds of conflicts.  

And also, what we see here—"no Jew nor Greek"—is not primarily about nationality. It is more about the basic attitude toward the divine, different religions, or different worldviews, especially regarding the spiritual world. These are two basic concepts that exist even now, and Christianity is neither of them. The first concept is expanding God everywhere—into different powers of nature, different gods, or bodhisattvas, each with different goals and conflicting interests. This creates a kind of strife within the divine realm, as if breaking God apart and scattering Him everywhere. This could be pantheism, polytheism, or many other versions of it.

And most modern sects and heresies are also a form of neo-paganism—New Age, Buddhism, Hinduism, and many other belief systems. Even communism, in many ways, creates idols, as does consumerism. You have those idols: Lady Gaga and many other figures. It’s all a form of neo-paganism. When we create idols for ourselves—whether we worship what we want to purchase, different brands, trademarks, series, or even things like ladies' jeans—all these advertisements reflect the paganism that surrounds us. It may not seem important to a person, but it carries a kind of pseudo-divine influence, persuading you to buy things, to associate yourself with a brand or a lifestyle. Our marginal culture, with its different music groups and trends, becomes paganism because it revolves around idols.  

The other worldview, the Jewish perspective, narrows God, making Him strict and confined to commandments. In this view, we lose God’s love, the Word of God, and the fullness of His presence. It’s a form of monotheism without love, without the Holy Spirit, without the Son of God coming into the world to unite humanity with God through His Word. Without the Holy Spirit, grace, blessing, or the life that flows into your heart, transforming you and leading you to truth and holiness, this becomes a very narrow understanding of God. It distorts Him into something opposite to who He truly is, reducing Him to a kind of mammon—a perverted god. This is why they expected the Antichrist instead of Christ, and why, in the end, many will still expect the Antichrist.  

This is another topic. In Christ, neither of these distorted views works. In Christ, we find faith in the Holy Trinity, which surpasses all these limited and perverted understandings of God, the divine, and religion. Religious wars often stem from these grounds—conflicts between Muslims, Jews, and many other groups.  

Lastly, there is "no male nor female" in Christ, which is even more difficult to understand. I tell people who come into the church that here, you leave behind your external identity—whether you are male, female, a child, an adult, or elderly. All these things remain outside. In Christ, we are a new creation. What does this mean? We can look at it from different perspectives. For example, someone who is physically strong, a powerful man who can carry trucks, may have less faith and courage than a feeble, sick woman who cannot even walk. Yet, her faith and love for the Lord may give her more strength and courage to face challenges, persecution, or temptation. Her spiritual strength, rooted in Christ, surpasses physical abilities.  

Another understanding is that when we are in Christ, we focus on God the Father. We enter into a dialogue with Him, and all earthly interests, including sexual desires, fade away. We no longer see people through the lens of gender or physicality but as children of God, His creation, brothers and sisters. All other thoughts disappear. In this state, we no longer perceive ourselves as men or women in the room. That distinction fades away because we carry Christ within us.  

This is something we hear often, but we don’t always live it out. We don’t always experience this reality in our hearts. Yet, it is the truth we are called to embrace as new creations in Christ.

So today, I hope this serves as a good reminder that we are still far from where we need to be, and there is much we must do to change. Even our nature can be overcome when we are in Christ.  

Another important point is that the Antichrist, or the spirit of mammon, seeks to mimic the unity we find only in God through Christ. The Antichrist does not want us to "put on Christ"; he wants us to "put on Antichrist." What does this mean? It is destruction. When we see the rise of unisex identities, where people no longer distinguish between male and female, it is not because they have overcome their nature in Christ. It is because they have put on the Antichrist. Their souls and hearts are so corrupted that it no longer matters to them whether they are male or female, or with whom they engage in immoral behavior. You can have 63 different genders, but this is not a sign of spiritual transcendence—it is a sign of deep corruption.  

Imagine a garbage dump. Everything there is corrupted, decomposing, and decaying. What was once distinct—apples, oranges, and other fruits—is now just a smelly, indistinguishable mess. It may all look the same, but it is not unity; it is corruption and decay. This is not the unity we find in Christ. It is the unity of destruction, the unity of the Antichrist.  

Similarly, when we hear people say, "You are no longer tied to your nationality or country; you are a citizen of the world," this is not the unity of Christ. It is a false unity based on profit, selfishness, and attachment to worldly things—entertainment, passions, and earthly desires. This false unity is achieved through wars, revolutions, and the deliberate dumbing down of society through music, gadgets, and technology. People no longer read or think independently; they become like a herd, mindlessly rushing in one direction. This is the society of the future they envision—a cyberpunk, cyber-trash world. It has nothing to do with the unity we find in Christ.  

Let us not confuse these two types of unity. One is the unity in Christ, rooted in love for God, holiness, and the body of Christ. The other is the anti-Christian unity of mammon, rising from below, from hell itself. Hell is also a place of unity—a unity of destruction. The final kingdom of the Antichrist will be a one-world kingdom, where everyone desires one leader. They will eliminate differences and wars, believing it will bring them profit and comfort. But this unity will ultimately fail.  

We, however, must strive to be one in Christ. We must attach ourselves to sanctity, love, and the act of "putting on Christ." Each of us must become a representative of Christ, so that others can see Him in us, through us, and with us. May the Lord grant us the spiritual strength to seek Him, to overcome our selfish desires, to destroy the mammon within us, and to receive His blessing and guidance. Especially now, during this critical time, let us put all our effort into drawing closer to Christ, allowing Him to dwell in our hearts.  

God bless.
