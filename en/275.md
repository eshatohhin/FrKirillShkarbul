# Mirror of Apostasy If for you God is dead, you are dead for God

Dear brothers and sisters, in our daily lives and in our faith, we can experience both negative and positive moods. However, neither of these moods inherently includes God.

For example, sometimes we feel low and upset—upset with God, upset about what has happened and why He allowed it, or upset with the world and life in general. Even when we go to pray, our hearts may be elsewhere. We pray because we feel obligated to, not because we trust in the Lord. We may even doubt the efficacy of prayer. When we think this way, prayer indeed becomes ineffective. When we mechanically repeat words like "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy," counting them out, such prayers do not reach God. He does not hear them.

On the other hand, when we are in a positive mood, we might feel successful, smart, or lucky, attributing our achievements solely to ourselves. In such moments, God is absent from our thoughts. We act as though there is no God, and consequently, God is absent from our lives.

On a societal level, consider the situation in China, near Taiwan, where atheist ideology prevails. Most people there believe there is no God and prefer to live without Him. This is more about relationships than ideas. They think it is easier to live without God. I grew up in a similar environment in the Soviet Union, where there were no churches, only factories. In my town, not far from Moscow, there wasn’t a single church, and people lived as though God did not exist. Most were atheists—perhaps 90%—and it felt as though God was absent.

In such a world, we can distinguish two types of societies. The first is the positive, industrious type, where people build factories and infrastructure in socialist or communist systems. In the post-industrial world, it’s about markets, prosperity, and constructing high-rises and shopping malls. It seems as though everything is progressing without the need for God. Instead, people worship Mammon, persuaded by idols and material possessions. They believe that with enough money, they can thrive in this world without God.

This is Babylon—whether it’s socialism, dictatorship, or so-called capitalism, which is no longer true capitalism. It’s all about building idols, and God is not needed. As a result, God seems to withdraw Himself. For the majority, this is why the world experiences plane crashes, construction failures, and building collapses—as though there is no God. Suddenly, wars break out, and people ask, "Where is God? How can He allow this to happen?" Or tragedies like Columbine occur, where a disturbed individual kills innocent students, making it seem as though God is absent. When society lives as though there is no God, it feels as though there is no God.

Of course, God exists, but it appears as though He is not present. He does not intervene much in the lives of those who do not respond to Him. He calls to them patiently, but eventually, He may say, "Okay, if you don’t want Me, I will leave you alone." This is a dire situation.

Another form of apostasy, another way of living without God, is the destructive path.

Go to Africa or some Middle Eastern countries where people are killing each other every day on a massive scale. Everything is ruined; people suffer, blood is shed, and bombs fall. This is another way of experiencing an apostate life, and it seems as though there is no God. In such places, we see a dystopian, post-apocalyptic reality—similar to what is depicted in movies like *Mad Max*. Whether it’s a so-called successful, bright future without God or a ruined, chaotic world, the absence of God is palpable.

When people depart from God, whether on an individual or societal level, the pattern is similar. On an individual level, when you stop trusting the true God, you inevitably replace Him with something else. You don’t simply live in a void; you find another god. This could be occultism, astrology, or superstition. You might start believing in astrology, and it will take over your life. You’ll interpret events in a way that seems to confirm its validity, but it’s all an illusion—a fake miracle.

Alternatively, your god might become Mammon. You might think that the goal of life is to purchase and consume. You’ll buy houses, cars, and vacations, often going into debt. This isn’t just financial bondage; it’s spiritual bondage. You’ll become attached to material possessions, and they will dominate your thoughts, actions, and emotions. This fake god will control your life entirely.

Some people place their faith in their government or a strong leader, whether totalitarian or authoritarian. They might idolize their leader, seeing them as infallible, like the sun in the sky. If you believe in a political party or a dictator, they become your god. They will use you as a resource—whether for war, their economy, or their ambitious projects. You’ll be expendable, a tool for their goals.

In so-called democratic countries, people often worship the economy. They believe that financial markets and economic stability are the ultimate priorities. This becomes their god. They obsess over news about the economy, and it dictates their lives in profound and often surprising ways.

This dynamic works like a mirror. With God, it’s not entirely like a mirror, as He still seeks to guide you back to the right path. Unlike a fake god, God doesn’t abandon you completely. He continues to call you, even when you stray. For example, consider the story of the Gadarenes in the Bible. When Jesus healed two demon-possessed men, the townspeople saw their pigs drown in the sea and asked Jesus to leave. This was apostasy—they rejected God and refused to change their lives. Yet, Jesus showed mercy by sending the healed man to preach to them, telling them of God’s mercy. So, with God, there is always hope, unless the rejection is absolute and final.

There are also examples of negative gods. Some people, even Christians or Orthodox believers, become consumed by fears of digital control or a world government that seeks to brainwash and dominate everyone. These fears can become their god, shaping their worldview and actions. 

In all these cases, whether it’s materialism, political idolatry, or fear, the result is the same: a life dominated by false gods, leading to spiritual emptiness and bondage. The true God, however, remains patient and merciful, always calling us back to Him.

You are absolutely right. If we believe that any power—whether it’s a conspiracy, a political system, or even a religious figure—is absolute and total, and we allow fear of it to consume us, we become enslaved to it. Even if we hate it or resist it, it becomes our god. We lose trust in the Lord, and our peace of mind is replaced by constant worry and paranoia. Whether it’s obsessing over barcodes, digital control, or some other conspiracy, these fears can dominate our lives, becoming a form of spiritual enslavement. 

Any fake god, whether it’s a conspiracy theory, materialism, or even a religious leader, acts like a pair of glasses through which we see the world. It shapes our reality, creating a false world for us to live in. For example, the pope, for some, became a god. Originally just a Roman bishop, he was elevated to an absolute authority, leading to a schism in the church. People began to trust the pope more than Christ, believing he could absolve their sins and justify their actions, even violent ones like the Crusades. This misplaced trust led to a departure from true faith, as they no longer felt the need for repentance, the Holy Spirit, or a personal relationship with Christ. This risk of idolizing human figures or systems remains a danger even today.

In the past, I’ve discussed myths, narratives, and fake perceptions. These are all different masks that people wear, but behind them lies the same face—the face of the devil. Spiritual people must be vigilant and discerning, able to sense what lies beneath these deceptions. As the Psalmist says, *“Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly”* (Psalm 1:1). This doesn’t just refer to wicked or criminal people but to anyone who does not prioritize God in their lives. 

If you surround yourself with people—even relatives—who are nominal Christians or non-believers, whose lives revolve around self-indulgence, entertainment, or materialism, you risk adopting their worldview. Over time, their priorities will become yours, and their fake gods will become yours as well. This is true even if you consider yourself Orthodox or deeply religious. If you adopt the lifestyle and values of those who do not have God at the center of their lives, you will inevitably begin to worship the same idols they do.

This applies to anything that takes the place of God in our lives. It could be art, a hobby, or even something seemingly innocent like calligraphy or a passion for culture. If we become overly attached to these things, they can become our gods, our idols. This is why paganism has overtaken the world in various forms. Even religions that claim to be monotheistic can fall into idolatry if they prioritize rituals, leaders, or traditions over a genuine relationship with God. 

Communism, socialism, and even capitalist democracy have their own idols—whether it’s the state, the economy, or material success. These systems, while seemingly different, all share the same underlying logic of idolatry. They replace God with human constructs, leading people away from the truth.

The key is to remain vigilant and rooted in God. We must guard our hearts and minds, ensuring that nothing—whether it’s a conspiracy, a political system, a hobby, or even a religious figure—takes the place of God in our lives. As spiritual people, we must constantly discern what is true and what is false, rejecting the masks and glasses that distort our vision of reality. Only by keeping God at the center of our lives can we avoid the trap of idolatry and remain free in Christ.

Let us be deeply aware that if we are not driven by the love of Christ, if we are not serious about our spiritual lives, if we neglect prayer and fail to pursue Christ and His truth with zeal every day, we are slowly drifting into idol worship. It is not a neutral state—thinking, "I’m free, I’m on my own"—because you will never truly be on your own. The world, especially through the gadgets and technology that surround us, will pull you into its grasp. These devices, with their endless streams of videos, entertainment, and distractions, can easily become our idols if we are not careful.

May the Lord grant us the zeal to seek Him earnestly. May He protect us from delusions and the subtle traps of demonic influence. May He fill our hearts with His peace and make us true witnesses of His love and truth, rather than witnesses to our own passions, fears, and delusions. God bless you, brothers and sisters.

The same principle applies to politics. If you become overly involved in political matters, it can consume your life and become your calling, replacing God as your primary focus. Politics, like any other earthly pursuit, can become an idol if it takes precedence over your relationship with Christ. Let us remain vigilant, keeping our eyes fixed on the Lord, so that we may walk in His truth and avoid the snares of this world. God bless.
