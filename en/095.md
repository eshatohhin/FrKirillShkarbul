# Lord’s miraculous help in the Mission

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share with you some of my experiences in the mission this year on the Mariana Islands.

We remember when the Lord sent His disciples in the Gospel of Mark. We hear that the Lord went and preached the word of God, and the Lord worked together with them. The special powers of the Lord and signs accompanied the word that they preached, verifying this word, like proof, like a stamp, that what they did was coming from the Lord. It's true.

So, it's now 2,000 years since those days, but we are still in this mission of spreading the word of Christ to the ends of the world. Here in the Mariana Islands, I also have some experiences that I believe are coming from the Lord. I will share three instances with you. There were many more things that happened, but I chose these three instances because they have a direct relationship with how the development of the mission progressed and how we had success in the mission this time.

The first event happened here on Guam when I first arrived. I went to many different places, distributed brochures, and spoke with many people. But there was no real success. People didn't really need anything; they were busy with their own things. At some point, you feel maybe you came for nothing. Maybe it's just a waste of time, a waste of money. Sometimes those thoughts come, and the Lord gives you inspiration and proof that what you are doing is right.

One of such signs happened one day. They told me that there was one person who might be Orthodox—she is Russian, might be Orthodox—but she was not there. I left a message in the Indian shop downstairs, along with my phone number, saying, "I'm an Orthodox priest; if anything, give me a call, and I will come." After one hour, someone called me and said, "We are a whole family; we want to meet with you because we are Orthodox and we want to be stronger in our faith."

This family had been here for three years already and had faced many difficulties and temptations because there was no church. They were on the edge of maybe losing their faith because they were being pulled by sects, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, to join them. They were in that uncertainty, wondering, "How come there is no church?" But they were seeking God; they were seeking true faith that is alive. When they heard about me coming here, they were very surprised and excited. Now, they are the strongest believers, I think, on this island, on Guam, and they have helped develop the mission further.

They've invited all their friends—local friends, Russian friends—and we've met with these people. They know ways to communicate through electronic media. I recorded a video which they posted in many places, attracting other people. They've invited me to stay in their house, and tomorrow we will baptize their son. All this happened just because I thought, "Why not leave a little note in that shop?" If I had not done that, they would not have found me, I would not have found them, and I would not have met so many people here on Guam. The mission might have had very low productivity, with not much results. But because of that little movement that I did, which was not necessary, but I decided to leave that note, now we have a very successful mission going on.

Another event, which I also think comes from the Lord, happened on Saipan. Saipan is separate from Guam; there is not much interaction between the two. People here seldom go there, and most of them have never been there. The same goes for people who live there; it's not like Taiwan, where people go back and forth from south to north. Here, it's two different worlds; the lifestyle is different, and many things are different.

When I arrived there, it was also starting from zero. You just go outside, you don't know anyone, and you try to make people interested.

One day, I was very tired from the heat. I came back home, rested a little, and then I couldn’t get up. I was so exhausted that I just lay on the bed, thinking, "Maybe that’s enough for today. Maybe I’ll just rest and do something else in the hotel. It’s almost getting dark—less than an hour left." But then, I felt an inspiration, a kind of power urging me to get up and go. It was as if something was telling me, "There’s a place where you might find some people."

It reminded me of the apostles when they were fishing all night and caught nothing. Then, during the heat of the day, the Lord said to Peter, "Go and throw the net right there." Peter obeyed, and he had such a great catch. Something similar happened to me. I forced myself to get up and go out. I walked to the shore, where many people were gathered, but no one seemed interested in faith. People were barbecuing, relaxing, and not paying attention. When they see a priest, they usually turn away; they don’t want to learn something new.

But as I walked into a community area near the beach, where some people were having tea or dinner, a Russian lady—the only Russian lady on that beach—immediately called out to me. She asked, "Are you an Orthodox priest?" I said yes, and we spoke in Russian. It turned out that she and her family were Orthodox. Her husband, an American of Mexican descent, had just been baptized three weeks earlier and was very serious about his faith. He had been praying that the Lord would send a priest to help establish a church on the island of Saipan. He was so surprised and said, "It’s too fast! I just prayed, and here is the priest coming to us."

They were the first Orthodox people I met on Saipan, and they turned out to be the most active in terms of faith on the island. After this encounter, they called their friends—Russians, Mexicans, and people from other countries—and we organized two meetings, three services, and one catechism class at their house. It was a great development for the mission, and I believe this is now the stronghold of Orthodoxy on Saipan. Two other Mexican men even decided to become Orthodox, which was very inspiring.

If I hadn’t listened to that calling to get up and go out that evening, none of this might have happened. The trip might have been unsuccessful. I feel that this, too, was a sign from the Lord—a kind of divine inspiration.

The third sign that the Lord is with us and helping us happened just yesterday. I had spent the day distributing brochures and talking to people, but nothing significant came of it. By the end of the day, I was tired. A friend invited me to a night market for a snack, and as I was passing a barber shop, I thought, "I’ll be going back to Taiwan soon and will have to quarantine for 14 days. My hair will grow long, and it’s hot in Taiwan. Maybe I should get a haircut now. It won’t take too much time." 

As I passed the barber shop, one of the women working there looked at me with attention. I wondered why—maybe she wanted more business, or maybe it was just because I was a foreigner or a priest. But it turned out that she was a very devoted Christian, a Protestant, but strong in prayer and faith. She had a feeling that I would bring a special message to them. I didn’t know this at the time, so I just walked in. They assigned another girl to cut my hair—most of the workers in the shop were Korean, and many of them were Protestant.

And this other girl asked, "What is Orthodox? Who are you? Is it Jewish Orthodox?" I explained, "No, we are Christian Orthodox." She searched about Orthodoxy in Korea and discovered that Korea has an Orthodox Church. She became very interested in it. Later, she told me that earlier that morning, she had a dream about Jesus. She rarely has dreams like that—maybe it was the first or second time in her life. In the dream, she saw Jesus, and she felt that something special would happen that day. She connected my visit to that vision.

After I left the shop, I gave them my brochure and contact information, as I do with everyone. About 15 minutes later, she called me and invited me to dinner at their house, along with the other woman who had looked at me when I passed by. These two women happened to be the most serious and had the strongest faith in the shop, which had about seven or eight people working there. We talked about faith, salvation, the Church, and the challenges the world is facing today for about three hours. I believe they are now on the path to the Orthodox faith.

Also, on that same day, we had an online class discussing the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 8, verses 5 to 13—the story of the centurion who was outside the Church, even a pagan, yet Jesus said he had stronger faith than anyone in Israel. This was a powerful reminder to me that among people of faith, even outside the Orthodox Church, there are those with profound devotion. These two women, though Protestant, showed a faith that deeply moved me. They found me because of that vision—this cannot be mere coincidence.

This is another sign for me that the Lord is with us, accompanying us and making the mission successful. It’s not about us, our methods, or well-written brochures—it’s the Lord’s mighty hand at work. I have many other instances from this trip that I believe are signs from the Lord, though I don’t have time to share them all now. But please, be strong in faith, rely on the Lord, and ask Him to strengthen our faith and help us in our testimony and ministry. His mighty hand will be with us.

Amen. Until the end of the world, to the glory of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. May the Lord’s blessing and grace be with you.
