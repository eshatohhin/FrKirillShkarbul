# If Mind is not with God, Intellect is enslaved by flesh

Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan. We just had a divine service here last night, and I'm staying here for another couple of days to meet with some of the faithful and talk to them. Today, I decided to record a video about the topic I began last time because it needs some clarification—this tension between reasoning, faith, and spirituality. There is a lot of criticism, as I mentioned. People say, "You don't use your mind; you are fanatics," or "You are against science," etc. 

Well, let us first look at the Gospel. We always need to keep in mind that human reasoning, the human mind, is a gift from the Lord. Every ability we have is given to us by the Lord. But we need to understand the implications of relying on our own mind instead of being united with the Lord, following His will and His revelation. Why is there this conflict between human logic and faith at times?

You remember the apostle Peter. He walked on the water; the Lord allowed him. He said, "If you want to come, come." So Peter began walking on the water. Then he looked down and saw the ocean, how deep it was, and the waves. His mind told him it was impossible. "How can this be?" he thought. He began to drown, and then the Lord reached out His hand, saved him, and said, "Why did you doubt?" The word "doubt" here means to distinguish—"dia krino" in Greek. Why did you make this distinction? This is possible; this is impossible. We will come back to this word. Lack of faith is related to this doubting distinction.

Then, in Mark 11:22-25, we also read that if you have faith and say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and you do not doubt in your heart, it will happen. It is the same verb—you would not distinguish in your heart. 

In other places, we see the Lord telling people that they will be brought to trial and not to think about what to say or how to defend themselves. The Holy Spirit will tell you what to say. Here again, we see that the Lord tells them not to think. Don't think; just go, and the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say. 

Also, in 1 Corinthians 11:29, we read that you should partake in the Holy Communion without doubting, without distinguishing.

Having said all this, let's look at Romans 8:5-7. I'm retelling it in my own words: Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. The mind set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. So, to live according to the flesh... (Romans 8).

So, there are two ways of existence: the way of existence according to the flesh and the way of existence according to the Spirit. Whoever is guided by the Spirit cannot be judged by those who are guided by the flesh because they are guided by the Spirit. However, the one guided by the Spirit can judge everything. Again, this idea of judging comes into play here.

To better understand all of this, the Holy Fathers speak about *nous*—a concept that is often translated as "mind" but requires some clarification. If we want to understand the ascetic tradition and the prayer of the heart (*hesychia*), we really need to know how to read the Holy Fathers, as they provide deep insights into how this works. The idea of *nous* originates from Greek philosophy, where different philosophers had varying interpretations of it. We won’t delve into ancient Greek philosophy here, as it is rich and complex, and we don’t want to make this overly complicated or too theological. 

Essentially, *nous* refers to the human capacity to communicate with God. It is the spiritual self within a human being. God is spirit, and the physical world is another realm, but in Christianity, there is no separation between the two. Humanity is created in the image of God, meaning we are both spiritual and carnal. We have a physical body and live in a world of physical objects, relationships, and earthly realities. The question, then, is how the spiritual lives within this earthly world.

The Holy Fathers, such as Saint John of Damascus, explain that there is a faculty of reasoning—or, more broadly, thinking—which includes the rational ability or intellect. This intellect encompasses various abilities: judging, willing, discerning, intuition, empirical knowledge, and feelings. All of these are part of the intellect. For simplicity, let’s consider the intellect as everything that happens in your heart and mind—your rational thinking, feelings, perceptions, conscience, and so on. 

Within this intellect lies the *nous*, sometimes referred to as the "spiritual eye" of the human soul. This spiritual eye can either be alive and open or closed. The *nous* is not simply the mind in the sense of the brain; rather, it is the ability to contemplate the divine, to have a faith relationship with the Lord, and to gain spiritual understanding. It perceives the will of God and absolute values. These things are grasped by the *nous*, or the mind, and the *nous* becomes the guide for everything else. 

If you have this communication with the Lord, your *nous* is alive, and you are spiritual. Then, you can have right judgment, proper feelings, and everything will be aligned with the Spirit. You will be guided by the Spirit or the *nous*—some Fathers even use these terms interchangeably. However, let’s not conflate them here. 

If, on the other hand, you are driven by the flesh, your *nous* will be enslaved, and you will not be able to make use of it. Everyone has a *nous*, whether they are sinners or not, carnal or not. But if we are guided by the flesh, our *nous* becomes ineffective. 

Returning to the healthy state: if you are spiritual and your *nous* is restored, healthy, and communicating with the Lord, then you will need this *nous* to face reality. The Holy Fathers refer to this as *logos*—reasoning, or what we might call the "narrow intellect." There is the all-encompassing intellect that includes everything, and then there is the practical intellect, which we can think of as the reasoning faculty applied to daily life. 

This practical intellect, guided by the *nous*, allows us to navigate the world while remaining connected to the divine. It is through this balance that we can live according to the Spirit, even as we exist in the physical world.

Let’s call it the *practical intellect*. This practical intellect helps you determine what to do in specific situations—it’s very practical. It also gives you the ability to discern different concepts, ideas, and realities that you encounter in the world. However, this discernment isn’t solely the work of the practical intellect. There’s another term for it: *anoia*, which refers to the thinking or discerning ability. Sometimes, this is used alongside the practical intellect, but let’s not make it too complicated. 

Essentially, there is the *nous*, which is responsible for looking at the spiritual, communicating with the Lord, and receiving revelation and truth from Him. Then, there is the practical intellect, which helps you navigate daily life, make decisions according to the Lord’s will, and understand the world around you. 

When the *nous* is enslaved and we are driven by the flesh, we still have this lower, practical intellect or discerning ability. It doesn’t disappear, but because it lacks the guidance of the *nous*, it operates on its own. When it operates independently, it becomes hostile toward God. It might make decisions that are beneficial in a worldly sense—you might be very smart, even a genius—but it will be in enmity with the Lord. 

This is why people can be highly intelligent, excel in science or philosophy, and yet remain disconnected from the Lord. Their thinking, their philosophies, and their pursuits may have nothing to do with God’s will. In fact, they may actively oppose it. This is why some of the most learned individuals—philosophers, scientists, and intellectuals—are often the most resistant to faith and spirituality. Their highly developed but fallen intellect can lead to pride, selfishness, and self-centeredness, making them unwilling to humble themselves before God. 

This is why we must be very careful when studying philosophy or any human wisdom. We must ask: Does it align with the truth of the Lord? Does it help me better understand God’s will? If not, I should treat it as a tool, not as true wisdom. True wisdom is connected to the *nous*, the spiritual mind, and the Spirit. 

With this in mind, the task before us is to recover our *nous*. We don’t recover it by reading countless books or accumulating knowledge. Instead, we recover it through spiritual life, repentance, and immersing ourselves in the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the Holy Fathers. We strive to align ourselves with their way of life, their values, and their spiritual perspective. It’s not just about learning from them but about restoring our spiritual ability to be alive in God, allowing Christ to govern and guide us. 

This is especially crucial as we approach the Great Lent, a time of preparation and reflection. Living according to God’s will will be decisive in the Last Judgment, which we recall this week. It’s not just about doing good deeds or showing compassion and mercy, though these are important. It’s about being wholeheartedly dedicated to serving the Lord, learning from Him, and receiving His wisdom. 

We want to be like Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to His words. While Martha’s role is also necessary, the greater goal is to be like Mary, allowing the Lord to guide us in how to be Martha as well—using what we receive from Him in practical ways. 

May the Lord grant you wisdom, joy, and the strength to sacrifice all carnal distractions for the sake of union with Him, which brings true life and peace.

We want to have life and peace, and we don’t want to have death, which comes from the flesh. May the Lord bless you, strengthen you, and fill you with joy as you prepare for the upcoming Lent. Amen.
