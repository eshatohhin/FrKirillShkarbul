# How to do Mission in the 21st century

Dear brothers and sisters, one subscriber wrote that he subscribed because he has an interest in mission, and some of my videos are not related to mission, especially recently. Well, today I want to talk about what mission is in our day, and whether I have lost focus and strayed from talking about mission. We will see that many things are related to mission, and these things, these apocalyptic topics, are also quite relevant. But first of all, let us talk about what mission is and what mission in today's world looks like. 

Sometimes when we hear the word "mission," we think of someone who goes to a faraway place, perhaps a jungle, to tell aboriginal people about the gospel and about Jesus. Maybe we also think of the apostles. Three thousand years ago, they were sent by Christ to go to all nations. They went to those so-called "savages," those wild people, and told them about Christ. They believed, their lives changed, they built churches, prayed, and became peaceful. In some ways, mission today is exactly the same as it was when it all began. In some ways, it is exactly the same because the Lord said, "You will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth," and we will talk about this. What does it mean to be a witness of Christ? What testimony do we bear? This hasn’t changed; it’s exactly the same. But many things have changed.

Today, if we are in a post-Christian world or in a nominally Orthodox world that used to be Orthodox, our mission would not be as simple as saying, "Okay, everyone, do you know that the Lord has risen? Do you know who your Savior is? That God is almighty? I will now preach to you." Well, everyone might say, "We already know all about this. In fact, we’ll tell you even more than you know. But we don’t want to go to church. We also want to do yoga, we want to do this, we want to do that. And actually, the church has these problems, so we don’t believe it. Even the gospel—maybe it’s not true, and so on."

They will tell you all kinds of things, okay? And this is why it's called post-Christian. People have turned away from Christ and returned to sinful ways of life, embracing neo-paganism, communism, existentialism, or whatever other misguided ideas. They don’t want Christianity. So, how do you deal with that kind of setting? And what do you do in other countries? We now have pagan countries that have heard about Christ but don’t know much about Him. They are more inclined to preach their own beliefs rather than receive Christianity, though some countries, like Korea, have recently embraced the Lord—even if it’s in a Protestant context. We also have communist countries, Muslim countries, and others. In the 21st century, mission work is different in each of these places. The methods and approaches have changed significantly from the past. But let’s go step by step.

First of all, we need to begin with ourselves. If we don’t have love for God, if we don’t feel connected to the kingdom of heaven, if we don’t have any experience or attachment to it as citizens of this kingdom of resurrection, if we don’t truly understand what resurrection means—if we’ve only read about it in a book and got excited, thinking, "Oh, it’s a nice book," and then just preached from it—this is not mission. We need to be standing on this path ourselves. Our faith must be well-grounded in our life in Christ. Only then can we begin to share it with others. If people don’t feel that we are truly people of Christ, if they see that we are jealous, selfish, or attached to worldly things, they will say, "You know what? This book you’re preaching—you don’t live by it. The gospel you preach is just another fairy tale, another utopian story that doesn’t work in real life." Your mission will fail. It’s like building on sand.

The first thing for us is spirituality. If we don’t have a well-grounded spirituality—I’m not saying we need to become saints who levitate and perform miracles—but we need to change our character. We need to be loving. People should feel that we are positive, that we care about them, that we love them, that we are not vain or self-centered. We should be approachable, with truth and kindness streaming from our hearts. This is so basic. No matter which society you’re in or what mission training you have, if you lack this foundation, you will fail. I want to emphasize this because mission is not just for special, paid missionaries who get a visa and go to another country. No, missionaries are everyone who believes in Jesus Christ. If we don’t bear testimony about Him, we’re not truly Christians—or we’re very poor ones. We don’t deserve to be called Christians. We need to bear some kind of testimony. This testimony doesn’t have to be preaching on a big stage to thousands of people. It could even be at home. People can receive this testimony from you about the love of Jesus Christ, and that makes you a witness of Him. You could be an old, uneducated woman washing dishes at home. It doesn’t have to be something grand. Through love, a kind heart, and prayer, she can bear testimony to the love of Jesus Christ.

Now, let’s move toward active mission. I’ve just talked about the internal aspect, directed at ourselves. Now, let’s talk about outreach. First of all, we need to see...

We need to see what we are testifying about. "You will be my witnesses"—but witnesses of what? There are three main things to remember. The first is **love**—the love that Jesus had for us. This is conceptual, and people will hear about it, but we need to feel it ourselves first. When we participate in this love, we will also have love toward God, and this love is what we testify about. That’s why martyrs, the saints who were venerated the most, are so significant. All the apostles, except John, were martyrs. They sacrificed their lives for Jesus Christ, enduring torture and death while bearing testimony to the resurrection and the love of Jesus that was in their hearts. Being a martyr isn’t just about dying; the most important thing is bearing witness. Martyrs are witnesses—they witness Jesus’ love, first and foremost. This love extends not only to fellow believers but even to their enemies, those who persecuted and killed them. This kind of love is beyond human ability—it comes from God Himself. It’s a powerful testimony that transcends human invention or sectarian ideas. To love those who hate you, torture you, or harm your family is a divine act. The acts of the martyrs show this clearly in their dialogues and responses. So, the first thing we testify about is **love**.

The second thing we testify about is **truth**—the true faith. This is where the Orthodox Church places its emphasis: the true, unaltered, and unadulterated faith. There is no room for ambiguity or compromise in the truth. We bear witness to the truth, and this is crucial because the truth must be clear and unwavering. However, there is a risk here. When we bear witness to the truth, some people may lack love and become legalistic, harsh, and judgmental. They might say, "This is heresy, you are bad, go to hell." This is not the way. Truth must always go hand in hand with love, prayer, and compassion for the human being—God’s creation. We must not fear false teachings because we have the true teaching from the Lord Himself. There is no fear in the gospel. So, the second thing we testify about is **truth**.

The third and super important thing we testify about is the **almighty power of God**—His omnipotence and glory. This is summed up in the resurrection. Jesus conquered death, rose again, and gives the power of resurrection to everyone who believes in Him. We bear witness to the resurrection as a historical event—it truly happened, and we are absolutely certain of it. But we also bear witness to the ongoing power of resurrection in our lives. This power is real; it changes us, resurrects our souls, and brings fruit in us. It’s not just a nice story or a distant idea. We have experienced this power, and we testify to its reality. 

So, in summary, we bear witness to **love**, **truth**, and the **power of resurrection**. These three elements are inseparable and form the foundation of our mission.

So, this is our witness about the resurrection of the Lord. These three important things—love, truth, and the power of resurrection—are what we must bring into our mission and evangelization, no matter the setting, country, or society we are in. There are many interesting examples, and I didn’t understand some of them at first. For instance, when I was in the parish—I wasn’t a priest yet, just a high school student—the priest there said, "We need to do some mission for the youth. Let’s have tennis after church." I thought, "This is really strange. How is tennis related to mission?" But later, I understood. Even though the young people in the parish knew about Jesus and had heard about the resurrection, they weren’t living in the union of love that we must have if we believe in Christ. Activities like tennis could help these young people come together, get to know each other, and build cohesion, love, and care for one another. It could also create opportunities for those outside the church who might not come directly to a service. They might see their peers—young men and women—doing something together, hear something about the gospel, and notice that these young people are different: kinder, more loving, and caring. This could lead them to explore faith and the resurrection further. So, while it’s indirect, it’s still related to mission. We can say it’s a form of mission.

There are many other examples, but I don’t want to make this video too long. Let’s conclude for today. Let us pray that the Lord gives us motivation and courage to discover how to do mission in whatever country or context we find ourselves. 

I mentioned apocalyptic topics earlier. The task of this channel is twofold: first, for those who are not yet Christians or Orthodox, to spark interest and break down false ideas about the Church. It’s not just about rules or restrictions but about love, truth, and resurrection. Second, this channel is for those who already believe in Jesus Christ but have drifted from the Church or are in another denomination. It’s here to strengthen them on their path, to help them come closer to the Lord and grow stronger in faith. The Lord told Apostle Peter, "When your brothers lose their faith, you will have to strengthen them. You are the rock, and you must have strong faith to support your brothers and sisters." I hope this channel can provide that kind of encouragement and help people grow stronger in their journey to the Lord.

This will also help mission work because if we have more motivated missionaries, we can accomplish more. One of our greatest weaknesses is that the Church often lacks motivated people for mission. Many think, "Mission isn’t for me. I believe, and that’s enough." Others come to the Church only to solve personal problems—like sickness or needing a baptism—and consider that sufficient. But without active faith, active spiritual life, and active mission, we are not truly Orthodox. Let’s think about this. Let’s ask for the Lord’s help, support, and guidance to strengthen us on this path before it’s too late. Life is very short, as we can see from what’s happening in the world today. May the Lord help us and bless us. Amen.
