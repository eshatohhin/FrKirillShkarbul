# Will the Kiev Lavra be given over to satanists

Dear brothers and sisters, we are now in the Great Land, and this is a time of deep repentance for the whole Church and of profound sorrow. It is also a time of great struggle against the evil and temptations that are arising. This year, the temptation is particularly severe—it is truly significant for the Church.

A few days ago, we learned that the government of Ukraine is planning to seize the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra monastery and expel the monks—more than 200 monks, priests, as well as the seminary and academy. The Kyiv Theological Academy, which is currently housed within the monastery, is also under threat. I myself studied and graduated from the Kyiv Theological Seminary and lived in the monastery for some time. I have a deep attachment to this place, and I know what life there is like, as well as the challenges that exist. Today, I want to share with you my thoughts on why this is happening, how we should respond, and what may ultimately occur.

We are living in a time when the world is moving toward the end times, toward the Kingdom of the Antichrist and the culmination of history. Of course, there will come a point when evil manifests itself fully. During the reign of the Antichrist, there will be no place for true Christians or the Church to exist. Those who refuse to pledge loyalty to him will face destruction. While we are not yet in those days, it is clear that after the Russian Revolution of 1917, the world entered a new era—an apocalyptic period, we might say. Figures like Lenin, Stalin, and others inflicted immense suffering on the world. They were not merely opposed to capitalism; they were part of a larger plan, a mission to create a socialist bloc. They targeted the Church, seeking to destroy it entirely across the Soviet Union.

We are now living in the aftermath of those events. Of course, we face new challenges and problems, but the devil's evil plan continues. Whenever an opportunity arises to strike at the Church, it will be taken. This is what is happening now. At some point, this had to occur, and it will not be limited to Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. It will happen everywhere. Do not think that if it does not affect you directly, you can simply watch from the sidelines, go to your church, pray, and assume everything will be fine. This monastery is a great pillar of the Orthodox Church, and its continued existence makes the Antichrist uneasy. Now, he is attempting to eliminate it.

First, I believe most of you are familiar with Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. It is one of the greatest monasteries of the Orthodox Church, established nearly a thousand years ago in the 11th century. It has been a center of spirituality, cultural development, and education. The culture and learning that emerged from this monastery shaped what we call Rus—the broader Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox tradition. Many talented writers, politicians, and Church hierarchs have come from this monastery. What is most important for us is that the blessed fathers of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra taught the Russian and Ukrainian people how to serve the Lord. They established monasteries throughout Ukraine and Russia, all stemming from this spiritual center. We cannot underestimate the spiritual and historical significance of this great monastery.

Now, if it is closed or handed over to a schismatic group—those who serve Satan, for I can call them nothing else—who claim to be Orthodox but are consumed by hatred for the Church and the Gospel of Christ, it would be a profound loss.

If the monastery is handed over to such people or turned into a museum controlled by these modern-day Satanists—who now govern most nations, not just Ukraine—it will undoubtedly be a significant victory for the devil. This would mark a major advance for him.  

When we hear painful or sorrowful news, the first thing we must do is repent. We must acknowledge our own guilt in what is happening. I, too, bear responsibility for these events through my sins, my failure to live a truly Christian life, and my lack of loyalty to Christ. This self-criticism is essential. The devil can only advance when we allow him to. If we remain steadfast in our faith and close to the Lord, he cannot harm us—unless, of course, we are called to martyrdom, which is a special and sacred mission. This may also be the case for the Lavra. Even if we suffer not because of our sins, we must still repent and consider that our sins may have contributed to the situation.  

Today, I do not wish to dwell on specific shortcomings or problems that may exist within the monastery, the clergy, the church authorities, or the faithful in Ukraine. Unlike the scandals often associated with other denominations, there is no such "dirt" here. However, we are weak in our zeal and in fulfilling our mission. We live in an age of declining faith and growing secularism, which has infiltrated every aspect of life. For this, we must repent.  

Today, I will not delve into these specifics, as the monastery is under immense pressure and may even face destruction. The faithful in Ukraine are deeply pained by these events. I will not discuss shortcomings further, but I must acknowledge that we in Russia also share responsibility for what is happening. The church authorities, in particular, bear some blame, especially due to their alignment with political agendas.  

Any political agenda is ultimately a myth, a narrative designed to deceive people. The Ukrainian government is now using political reasoning to justify its actions, but this is all manipulation. Politics is inherently manipulative. Do not trust newspapers or similar sources—they are tools of manipulation. The true goal of these actions is to destroy the Church, to pull people away from it, and to separate them from Christ. This is the underlying motive behind the attack on the monastery.  

Let me briefly recount what has happened to the monastery since the revolution, when these Satanists came to power over a century ago. In 1918, Metropolitan Vladimir was brutally murdered within the monastery, marking the beginning of the Red Terror, which brought rivers of blood across Ukraine and Russia. These revolutionaries initiated a massive bloodshed upon seizing power.  

In 1926, the monastery was converted into a museum, and by 1930, all traces of monastic life were eradicated. The monks were either killed, imprisoned, or sent to concentration camps, and nearly all were physically destroyed. Thankfully, such atrocities are unlikely to occur today. That period was a horrific and bloody chapter in history.  

There was a brief period of recovery from 1943 to 1961, but Khrushchev closed the monastery again in 1961. It was not reopened until the time of Perestroika in 1988. For the past 35 years, the Holy Church has regained possession of the monastery, its buildings, the caves, and the relics of the saints. This sacred place has been a beacon of faith and spirituality, and its potential loss would be a devastating blow to the Orthodox Church and all who hold it dear.

This period was a gift to us—a time to revive spiritual life, to engage in mission work, and to educate. Much has been accomplished over these years. When the monastery was returned to us, it was in ruins. Now, it stands as a testament to faith, with beautiful, bright churches restored to their former glory. At the time of its return, only one church was barely functional, and even it was in poor condition. Today, many churches within the monastery have been lovingly restored, adorned with holy icons, all through the efforts of the faithful, not the government.  

But now, the government claims, "This is ours. We will turn it into a museum. Everyone must leave." We will see what happens. They have set a deadline of March 29.  

Tomorrow, we will hold a *kathistos* in honor of the blessed fathers of the Kyiv Caves. On the night of the 28th, we will hold a prayer service, pleading for the Lord's mercy. It is the Lord Himself who will decide the fate of the monastery—not the Ukrainian government, not oligarchs, nor anyone else. If He allows these evil forces to achieve a temporary victory, it will be a heavy blow to the Church. Such an act would be a sacrilege against the holy relics of the saints and could mark the beginning of the last times, the era of the Antichrist.  

If they succeed, it will be a grave and serious development. But let us remember: without God, they will ultimately lose. Their victory, if it comes, will be brief.  

So, let us pray. Let us repent. Let us refrain from accusing others and instead pray for our enemies. We must pray for those who are persecuted, for blessed are we when we are persecuted. This is a great blessing, a sign that we carry the cross and remain loyal to Christ. He said, "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you." And this is what is happening now.  

Let us pray to our Lord, remaining faithful and loyal to Him through righteous living, selflessness, and sacrifice. Let us be eager to pray, to fast strictly, and to emphasize spiritual life. In these dark and terrible times, let us strive to overcome evil—both within our hearts and in the world around us.  

May the Lord bless you and grant you His peace. Amen. God bless.
