# Mission tips from Rota

Dear brothers and sisters, it has been quite a few days since I began my mission here on the island of Rota. I want to share with you the experiences, challenges, and methods I have discovered or tried here on this island. I believe this could be useful for you, no matter where you are. There is no need to travel to faraway islands to preach the gospel and carry out the mission. This is important for every Christian. I have discovered that being witnesses of Christ truly makes us feel that we belong to this mission, that we are following Christ and the apostles.

Here on the island of Rota, the people are mainly provincial. They have very close-knit groups, clans of friends. They gather together and celebrate often. Every day, you see people celebrating something or spending time on the beach. It is quite difficult to penetrate this closed society. Of course, the best scenario would be if someone from within the community could introduce you, vouch for you, and make the encounter more natural. However, when you don’t have such a luxury—for example, I don’t have any local connections here to help me meet others—there are still ways to overcome this challenge.

It is difficult to approach someone who is in a group, whether they are at a picnic or in a crowded shop. It feels very unnatural to start telling them something or handing out brochures. Instead, we need to "catch" people, as the apostles did. We are called to be fishers of men. We should approach people when they are alone or in small groups, perhaps two or three people. It is even better to approach them in places where they don’t expect to see you. For example, in rural settings, they rarely see foreigners. When they do, they become curious about who you are, why you are there, and where you are from. When they talk to you, they will likely remember the encounter for many years. This is an opportunity for us to carry out our mission.

When we do mission work, we should not worry too much about whether we have persuaded someone or not. No, we simply need to put ourselves out there, to be in places where people can see and meet us. The Lord will take it from there. Very often, I meet people at the exact moment I am supposed to meet them. For example, you might think that everything is under your control—what time you wake up, what time you go out, and that it’s all your project. But in reality, it is not. You simply do what you can to put yourself out there, to get involved in the mission in whatever way you can. You will see that the Lord will make you meet the right people at the right moment. At 4:26 p.m., you might meet someone you were meant to meet at that exact time. Even if you are just driving by, walking, pumping gas at a station, or doing something else, you will meet the right person at the right moment. This happens often because it is not us who are doing the mission; it is the Lord working through us.

Therefore, we should not think, "Oh, I am somewhere, and I have achieved something today or yesterday." No, you did not achieve anything. You were simply there because the Lord placed you there. Whatever happened was because the Lord allowed it to happen. At the same time, you need to do as much as you can.

So, who are the easiest people to approach? People who are working—construction workers, those cutting grass, or doing other manual labor. You might think they are busy, but never assume, "Oh, this person is too busy," or "This person is uneducated, just a peasant who doesn’t care about these things." We should not overthink it. If people are receptive, if they look at you or wave at you, you can approach them and share the message.

You need to break through this barrier, this psychological barrier. Talk to them. If you're an introvert—and most people are—you need to overcome that tendency. You need to sacrifice yourself for others. Be there for them, whether it’s him or her. Spend as much time as needed. If people want to talk to you, don’t think, "Oh, I have to go now; I have a meeting." No, you’re on a mission. Nothing else is more important. Simply be present and engage with that person. Perhaps this is the person the Lord has led you to find. Maybe, during an entire month of mission work, this is the only person the Lord intends for you to speak with. This is why we need to let go of our own concerns.

At the same time, we should not overburden ourselves. For example, I’ve discovered that roughly half of the time, if the whole day is dedicated to the mission, should be spent on mission work, and the other half on something else. Make it natural. Otherwise, you’ll break psychologically. If you push yourself non-stop, morning till night, every day, you’ll soon grow to hate it. So, take time to go sightseeing, record a video, read a book, or do something else. Switch things up. Don’t focus on just one thing all the time. Even with mission methods, try different approaches. Make it an adventure, not a monotonous routine. You need some variety to keep going, but your main goal should always remain the mission.

If something else becomes more interesting to you—like exploring the island—and it starts to take precedence, you’ll begin to fail. The Lord’s blessing will depart from you. This is what I’ve learned. You can have other interests, but they must remain secondary, not the main focus. Otherwise, the Lord will withdraw His presence.

I’m sharing this experience for everyone, including laypeople. As a layperson, you can do a lot. Mission work isn’t just for priests. I would advise laypeople to dedicate two or three weeks during the summer to intensive mission work, every day. Or, for example, set aside one day a week—say, every Friday—as a mission day. Or plan a mission weekend every second week. Go out and do it. It doesn’t matter where—another town, another neighborhood. This will help you develop a Christian understanding of how to do mission work. It will give you valuable experience and structure your efforts. It’s also good to receive Holy Communion regularly, every Sunday or even daily if possible, especially during a mission. At the very least, I suggest every Sunday. This will be incredibly helpful.

In terms of mission strategy, you need a basic plan. For example, if I see someone, I wave to them. That alone can be meaningful. Sometimes, that’s all you can do. You also need to learn to judge whether to approach someone or not. This takes experience and intuition. If you’re not a priest, you might consider wearing something that identifies you as a missionary—a T-shirt, a cap, or some kind of sign. People will notice and understand that you’re carrying a message. This is important when you’re on a mission. When you’re in mission mode, it’s like a derby—you’re fully engaged, focused, and ready to share the message.

You need to be ready to talk to people and introduce something meaningful. You’ll need some form of material—brochures with contact information, addresses, or a basic introduction to your mission. It’s also helpful to have small gifts, like icons, to offer as a token of goodwill. If possible, it’s ideal to have a partner. Two people can support each other psychologically, correct mistakes, and provide encouragement. This is why the Lord sent the apostles out in pairs. While working alone is possible, it’s more challenging. Having a companion makes the mission more effective and less isolating.

It’s also important to radiate the joy of life. People can sense if you’re depressed or struggling. If you’re in need of help yourself, how can you convincingly share salvation, enlightenment, or freedom? If you’re feeling broken, lonely, or overwhelmed, it might be better to take time for yourself before stepping out. This is why receiving Holy Communion is so vital. When you receive it properly, you feel Christ’s presence. You feel that He is with you, guiding you, and that you’re fulfilling His purpose. This gives you the energy, drive, and joy to carry out His work. Mission work should never be fake or pretentious. It must be authentic, rooted in your own experience and faith. You’re sharing something real, not playing a role.

When you have the opportunity to speak with someone, you need a basic strategy and a few prepared phrases. For example, I often start by saying, "I’m a priest from Russia." This immediately conveys two messages: "I’m a priest," which indicates this is about faith, and "from Russia," which shows I’m a foreigner in a new place. These two points can leave an impression, even if the conversation is brief. You could say, "I’m a missionary from Bangladesh," or any other country. That alone is a message. Then I usually add, "Orthodox." If the person is curious, they might ask, "What is Orthodox? Who are the Orthodox?" That opens the door for further discussion. Sometimes, that’s all you can say, and the person moves on. But if they engage, I might add, "It’s my first time on Rota," sharing a bit about my experience. Often, people respond warmly, saying, "Welcome! How do you like it here?" And from there, a dialogue begins. It might be short or long, but you’ve made a connection.

We need to have a strategy and be ready with phrases that steer the conversation toward faith. Avoid topics unrelated to the mission, like politics, vaccinations, or current events. If the person brings up such topics, listen respectfully, but don’t dwell on them. Our goal is to leave the impression that we are kind, genuine people sharing the word of God. We want them to remember, "That person was on a mission, spreading good news about Jesus." Months or even years later, they might recall that encounter and think, "Why am I wasting my life? Someone was out there sharing the gospel, and I’m stuck in my sinful ways." That memory could lead them to reflect and seek change. They might even recall, "That Orthodox person told me something important. Maybe the Orthodox are the true Christians."

In summary, mission work requires preparation, authenticity, and focus. Be ready with materials, simple phrases, and a clear message. Avoid distractions and stay centered on faith. Let your joy and sincerity shine through, and trust that the Lord will use your efforts to plant seeds in people’s hearts. Even if the impact isn’t immediate, your presence and words may one day lead someone to Christ.

Exactly. When you’re on a mission, ask yourself, "If I were a martyr in the second century AD, would I be talking about vaccines or politics? No, I would be sharing my love for Christ, my faith, how to pray, and what the Kingdom of Heaven is." That’s what the early Christians focused on, even in the face of persecution. If the martyrs in second-century Africa wouldn’t have brought up such topics, neither should we. Stay focused on what truly matters.

We also need to consider the mentality of the people we’re speaking to. Many people today lack genuine connections. They may have hundreds of Facebook friends, but those are superficial. They often feel lonely, depressed, and overwhelmed by life’s challenges. For them, having a real conversation with someone can be a rare and meaningful event—a light breaking through the darkness of their lives. Most people live without Christ, without God, and feel isolated. This is why they spend so much time on social media—they crave connection, feedback, and interaction. But what they find online is often fake and unsatisfying. It becomes a psychological addiction rooted in a real need for genuine human connection.

When you engage with people, you offer them something real: honest communication, a personal interaction, and a shared experience of faith. This is especially powerful in rural areas, where life can feel monotonous and uneventful. People there often welcome news, something new, or someone different. Your presence and message can be a refreshing and meaningful encounter for them.

However, it’s important to take care of yourself. If you feel psychologically tired, don’t push yourself too hard. Take a break for a day or two, rest, and then continue. The Lord will give you the guidance, wisdom, courage, and mental health you need to help others. But if you’re struggling yourself, it’s okay to step back and seek help. We must be in a good place spiritually, mentally, and emotionally to effectively continue Christ’s mission.

Let us keep going, no matter what, continuing the work of Christ. May the Lord bless you, guide you, and give you the courage and grace you need. Amen. God bless.
