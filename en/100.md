# Self conscience of the Church also needs a Reset

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in the southern part of Taiwan, in the city of Kaohsiung. Here, we have just recovered and held our first service after the lockdown. Glory to God that it's over, but now we have received this message, this lesson, that we need to be ready—perhaps for things much worse than what we have experienced.

Additionally, it is the beginning of the new school year. This new school year reminds us that we need to treat our Christian life as a form of study, learning, and growing in Christ, year by year, month after month. Our faith is not just about saying, "Okay, I belong to this faith; yes, I believe," and leaving it at that. No, if we are not growing, if we are not becoming more mature in Christ—as Apostle Paul said—if we are not striving to become the perfect man, the man in Christ, we are wasting our time and not truly following Christ.

So, let us today reflect on our understanding of ourselves and our roles as Christians, as the Church. What is our self-vision, our self-awareness as a Church in these times that are drawing closer to the last days? The changes happening now are part of the turns on the path toward these apocalyptic times. Humanity is moving along this winding road and will eventually arrive there. As this happens, we need to reconsider the Church's perception of itself. This perception also needs to change because we can see that the early days of the Church are resurfacing, but in a new form.

In those early times, the Church was a minority, often illegal, and persecuted by the government. The government was totalitarian, and the social structure was based on slavery. However, the slavery of that time was not as severe as what we are likely to face in the near future. Back then, slavery meant that a person's body or soul belonged to a ruler, and there were many different rulers. The enslaved person had no freedom but was conscious of their condition. The slavery that is coming, however, will be a mental slavery. A person's soul, heart, and mind will be completely enslaved, owned by a single, centralized ruler—unlike the past. This will resemble a large global sect or society.

This is where we are headed, through technology and various other means. The pressure on the true Christian message is increasing. We will face more censorship, more restrictions, and greater demands to comply with the system. In this sense, we are returning to those early times.

From the era of Saint Constantine the Great, when many people became Christians, up until now, we have enjoyed a relatively favorable period. During this time, the majority of people were not opposed to the Christian message, even if not all lived by it. Christianity held power, and most rulers in Europe and the United States professed Christian faith. But now, we are moving further and further away from that reality. Yet, our church mentality remains stuck in that past. This mentality has led us to believe that we can do nothing—that we are merely participants, waiting for church authorities to guide us, establish systems, manage finances, and handle other matters. We think, "I am nothing; I just need to have a relationship with God, pray, and then go home."

In the early Church, the mentality was very different. Believers saw themselves as witnesses of Christ. They understood that Christ expected something from them and that they needed to act for Christ. They did not wait for instructions from bishops or other authorities, especially since many of those leaders were often imprisoned. We saw this recently during the Soviet era.

So, I do not expect anything from bishops, patriarchs, or any external authority. Instead, I go and do as much as I can myself. The mission and preaching of the Church are now more critical than ever. When everyone was Christian, mission work seemed less urgent, but now it is of utmost importance. It is crucial that we do not wait for someone else to create a mission program or establish a department of mission. No, what matters most is small-scale, personal mission work. I go, I talk to people—my relatives, my friends—and I share my faith with them. I give my testimony. If even one person comes to faith through such efforts, it is a tremendous achievement, perhaps even greater than what any bureaucratic department could accomplish. Why? Because I am sharing a living faith, a faith that bears fruit and changes hearts. This kind of mission is vital.

The importance of the family church also becomes evident. In the early Church, we see Apostle Paul sending greetings to family churches, listing the people involved. The Church operated on a family scale, and we need to reflect on this. It is not enough to simply belong to a parish of 500 people. What matters is that, on a family level, we have this church. If we cannot establish it within our own families, we share it with our friends. This is another crucial aspect.

At the parish level, fostering a sense of community spirit is essential. Each of us must contribute to this by taking initiative, caring for one another, assisting the priest in various projects, proposing new ideas, and working to bring them to life. This is critical because, currently, many people are accustomed to attending church as part of a large crowd, praying, and then going home without a strong sense of community, belonging, or responsibility. If we lack this, the devil will easily break us, one by one. These elements are incredibly important in our times, especially as we face increasing persecution against the Church.

If we wait for a large parish to be established, it may never happen. But if we focus on small, intimate gatherings—even within a single household, with one or two families, or a few individuals—coming together to pray, that is incredibly powerful. Such gatherings strike a significant blow to the devil.

We can also see from history that significant changes and contributions to the Church often began on an individual scale. The Lord chose one willing person and, through them, accomplished great things. For example, Constantine the Great transformed the entire Roman Empire into a Christian one. Saint Athanasius the Great stood alone against heresy at one point, and through his efforts, true Orthodoxy prevailed. Alexander Nevsky defended the Church and Russia by rejecting Catholicism. Mark of Ephesus, as a single bishop, resisted the betrayal of Orthodox faith when everyone else had compromised. Because of him, the plan to undermine Orthodoxy failed. There are many such examples.

Therefore, we should not think, "I can do nothing; I am too small, uneducated, or insignificant." If we have a plan or a mission, we simply need a blessing, and then we act. We act as members of the Church, but we must be active and mission-oriented. We must feel that calling from the Lord and respond with a humble heart—not out of pride or a sense of self-importance, but because we recognize that this is our role in God's plan. It is not about being "super important," but about being faithful and obedient to the calling we have received.

The Lord helps me to become a small break in the system. As the Apostle Paul says, we are not unaware of the schemes of Satan. Satan’s plan today is to turn the entire population into a herd of swine, all running in the same direction. Everyone will work toward his goals, and his plan will succeed because people are being brainwashed to embrace whatever he desires. This is a spiritual battle. He can only achieve this when society is spiritually subjugated to his will. And society is increasingly manipulated now, far more than it was 50 or 70 years ago. 

We live in a consumerist society where people have no protection. They are bombarded with ads telling them, "Buy this, buy that," and they obey. The news instills fear, and people are consumed by it. People today are far more susceptible to such manipulation, even though it may seem like there is more education. In reality, people used to think much more independently, even 50 or 60 years ago. Now, however, people think in one direction. Whatever they are told, they believe and act upon it. 

In this situation, even one person can become a flaw in the system. Imagine a massive robot moving forward—if one small part breaks, the entire machine can be halted. Our goal now is to make the devil’s project fail, to stop it from progressing. This can be done on an individual level, as well as within small groups, families, churches, or small communities. We must feel this calling—to stand against the flow. While everyone else is moving in one direction, we must go in the opposite direction. This self-awareness is crucial. 

In the past, when everyone was Christian, it was easy to go with the flow, believing it was the direction the Lord wanted us to take. But that is no longer the case. Now, the flow is leading toward destruction, toward the Antichrist. We, however, must move in the opposite direction—toward Christ. The Lord said that a little leaven can leaven the whole loaf. The modern world is like this—it is easily influenced. People are becoming less and less autonomous, and we must use this to our advantage to bring about change in the right direction. 

Satan knows this method well and is also using it. We see how great destruction in the world is often accomplished through a few individuals. These are often fanatical, maniacal figures—Lenin, Trotsky, Napoleon, Hitler. They are usually Satanists, occultists, or perverts, driven by demonic forces. They act without fear, breaking everything in their path, while everyone else cowers and obeys. The devil often succeeds through these vessels of evil. 

Of course, we are not driven by fanaticism or mania. We are driven by the love of Christ. We love Christ, and because of that love, we can take risks and do extraordinary things for Him. He will give us vision, blessing, and guidance. We must remain humble, seek His blessing for whatever we do, and then act. 

Let us pray for this clarity and understanding. Let us recognize Satan’s plans and work to thwart them. We are against all his schemes, and we do not want our fellow human beings to be lost. We do not say, "Let the world go to hell." No, these are our people—our brothers and sisters in Christ, or in Adam, even if they are not yet part of the Church. We must fight for them, for their salvation, and for the glory of God.

We need to do whatever we can, whatever it takes, to help others avoid this delusion and destruction. The Lord will give us wisdom and help us in this mission. May the Lord's peace and wisdom be with you and me. Amen.
