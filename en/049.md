# Healthy criticism of the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about the church and modernity—modernization. Do we need to change things in the church? And why are we so often criticized for being too archaic, not being active, and not having as many people interested in the mission or in donations, as, say, in Protestant churches?

First, let’s address the issue of modernization. The main problem with modernization is that we cannot adjust to a fallen person. If society is moving further and further away from God, the church cannot also move further away from God and become just like society. We remember the words of the Lord: if salt loses its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out. The church does not want to lose its saltiness. It wants to bring the message of God to people in every historical period, to every nation, at any time, delivering the same message of God and maintaining the same spirit as received by the Holy Apostles—the Holy Spirit—without substituting it with anything else. Yet, the church must also find ways to bridge and communicate with people of any age and any society.

This unchanging nature comes from God Himself, who is eternal truth. Our Lord Jesus Christ said that heaven and earth will pass away, but His words will never pass away. They will not become irrelevant or outdated. They will remain valid and true for every generation, at any time. At the same time, we know that God is ever-renewing. He is life itself, and life is always becoming new. There is a constant newness in Him; He is not a fixed stone. Life always rejuvenates and brings forth new things. We cannot fully explain with our logic how these two truths coexist—God’s unchanging nature and His ever-renewing life. This is why it is difficult for us to understand, but we must remember that the Lord Himself does not change. His words are valid for all generations.

This is why the argument that we need to revise everything in the church—that we must get rid of all traditions, discard what the saints did in the past, and change the canons—is a wrong idea. It is a big mistake. However, we must also consider another situation that is causing trouble and creating problems for the church: the reduction of the church to mere religious culture. What do I mean by this? I mean when we think of faith as simply religious belonging and preserving traditions—doing things because "this is how we’ve always done them." We reduce Christianity to a checklist: you need to be baptized, read the Bible, pray, and go to church. If you’ve done these things, you’re fine. As long as we preserve these practices, we’re okay. But this is a big mistake because it reduces us to artifacts, like archaeological relics or antiques. We are not fixed, lifeless objects. We are alive, and if we become like artifacts, we will crack, perish, and become completely outdated.

We cannot become such a thing. To avoid this problem, we first need to understand what the church is, practically speaking. From the book of Revelation, we see that the church is depicted by Saint John the Apostle as a woman clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, with twelve stars crowning her head. She is radiant, shining, and full of life. Similarly, the Apostle Paul refers to the church as a bride. A bride, as we know, is typically a young woman—pure, full of life, and eager. This imagery shows us that the church is youthful, vibrant, and eager to act, to learn, and to grow.

At the same time, in the *Shepherd of Hermas*, a highly respected early Christian text from the beginning of the 2nd century, the church is depicted as an old woman. In one of his visions, Hermas sees a very old lady who guides him and explains the meaning of things. He later discovers that this old lady represents the church. This imagery reveals the church as ancient, wise, and experienced, like a grandmother who lovingly shares her wisdom with her grandchildren. The church carries the accumulated traditions, experiences, and spiritual wealth of centuries, offering it to us so that we may draw closer to God.

Now, let’s return to the question: Why is it that in the early church, many people were willing to sacrifice their lives for God? They gave up everything, donated their possessions, prayed fervently, and lived with Christ as their all. Yet today, we often lack that same spirit. Instead, we have become bureaucratic, lazy, divided within our communities and parishes, selfish, stingy, and more. Why are Christians today like this? Is it because the accumulated traditions, canons, rules, and prayers have become a burden, stifling the spirit? The answer is no. The answer is no because the church is both young and old—full of life and energy, yet also rich in wisdom and experience. These are not contradictions but different facets of the same mystery. The church cannot be reduced to a single description; it is a living mystery that we must view from multiple perspectives.

There is nothing wrong with the traditions and spiritual wealth the Holy Spirit has preserved in the church over the centuries. On the contrary, it is greatly beneficial. The problem lies not in the traditions themselves but in how we relate to them. So, you might ask, why do Protestants often seem more willing to donate, engage in missions, and act with zeal? One reason is psychological. In most Protestant denominations, there is no theology of sacraments in the same way as in the Orthodox Church. They do not experience the same mystical union with Christ in His body. While they have a different kind of connection, it is not as profound as the sacramental unity we have in Orthodoxy.

However, because many Protestant communities are relatively new—established a few years ago, a few decades ago, or at most a couple of centuries ago—they still carry a psychological sense of newness, vitality, and purpose. This freshness makes them eager and active. This is something we can learn from them. We, too, are called to embody this youthful zeal and vitality, even as we remain rooted in the ancient wisdom and traditions of the church. The church is both young and old, and we must live in the tension of these two realities, embracing the life and energy of the bride while drawing from the wisdom and experience of the grandmother.

But the problem is that we have developed a culture where, over hundreds of years, we have grown complacent. We see that everyone around us is not particularly eager, and we think, "Well, we’ve been like this for so long, and we have so many saints. Surely, we’ll go to heaven, so there’s no need to do anything more. Just stay as you are, and you’ll get there." This mindset, this culture, diminishes our eagerness to be with Christ, to take risks, to engage in mission, to sacrifice, and to give generously. As a result, we are not just clinging to the wisdom of the "old woman" (the church’s ancient experience) but sometimes slipping into the "archaeological artifact" mindset, which is far worse.

What we need to be aware of is this risk. We must understand why this happens and strive to avoid it. We need to cultivate a different mindset, set different goals, and deepen our spirituality. We must draw energy from Christ Himself—from His divine body and blood—and, having received this energy, put it into action in our lives. May the Lord grant us this blessing, strengthen us in our ministry and testimony, and fill us with His joy as we live this life with Him. Amen. God bless.
