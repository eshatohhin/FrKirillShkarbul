# Unbelief of Thomas & Dialectics

Dear brothers and sisters, this week the Holy Church celebrates Saint Thomas, an apostle who did not believe that Christ had resurrected. However, on the eighth day after Christ's first appearance to the disciples following His resurrection, the Lord also appeared to Thomas. This is a mystical and mysterious event that invites us to reflect deeply on the providence of God and the wisdom He employs in His plan to save humankind.

We see that the apostles themselves did not believe; they did not believe the women who received the message and reassurance from the angel and from Christ Himself. They did not believe the two disciples who came from Emmaus, who also saw the resurrected Lord. Despite their unbelief, the Lord appeared to them. He did not praise their unbelief; He scolded them for it, yet He still appeared to them.

Something similar happened with Thomas, but in his case, it was even more pronounced. All the disciples told him, "All of us, not just one, not just the women, not just a couple of people—all of us—we saw the resurrected Christ. He proved to us that He is resurrected in the body because He ate with us; we gave Him food." This was an absolute miracle. He came even though the doors were locked, but they could assure Thomas that it was indeed Him in His body, with all the wounds.

Apostle Thomas said, "Unless I touch Him myself, unless I put my fingers into His wounds, I will not believe." This radical unwillingness to believe is commemorated by the Church today. It leads us to ponder why the Lord still appeared to him. We see the end result, the fruits of this encounter, in Thomas's confession: "My Lord and my God." He was the first among the apostles to call Jesus God, a profound breakthrough for a Jew who believed that God is absolute and exists in spirit. For Thomas to call Jesus God required a significant shift in his understanding.

Later, we see that Thomas may have been the most radical and fearless of all the apostles. He traveled to the furthest countries—India, China, Babylon, and possibly even today's Pakistan—places very far away, unlike the other apostles who stayed closer to home. Thomas had no fear, perhaps because his love for the Lord was so great that he needed this hard, empirical proof of the resurrection to express his love fully. He was ready to die for Christ, as we remember from his willingness to go to Jerusalem. Thomas wanted this empirical proof, and the Lord granted it to him.

Thomas's unbelief was quite different from that of Judas, who also did not believe in Christ. Judas wanted a different kind of Messiah, which led him to betray Jesus for money and ultimately to his own destruction. The devil entered Judas's heart, and the end result of his unbelief was ruin. In contrast, the Lord was able to bring something good out of Thomas's initial doubt.

This reminds us of the dialectical process—thesis, antithesis, synthesis. We see this not only with Thomas and the apostles but also with many sinners who repented and followed the Lord. Meanwhile, some who appeared righteous and followed all the commandments did not follow Christ.

Today, let us reflect on the providence of the Lord, how He can bring good out of doubt and unbelief, and how even the most skeptical heart can be transformed into a vessel of profound faith and love.

So the Lord also brought good out of what seemed bad. Those who were once slaves to sin, under the dominion of Satan, were converted through repentance and became His disciples. They reached a synthesis in the Lord and gained salvation. There are many examples like this. I recommend everyone read Romans chapter 11, which addresses the issue of the Jews rejecting Christ. Through their fault, through their rejection and opposition to Christ's message and the Gospel, the Gentiles received grace and salvation. This is profoundly mysterious. If you read this chapter, you'll find it mind-blowing. There is a remnant of the Jews who will be saved, even though they now stand against God. Their hostility toward God deprives them of His blessings, but the Lord uses this to bring about the conversion of the Gentiles. This is something that is difficult for us to understand, but it reveals the depth of the Lord's wisdom—how He can use such circumstances to bring about good outcomes.

However, we should not think that all such dialectical processes come from God. We must judge by the results. Another example of God's wisdom is His allowance of Satan's existence. The Lord could destroy Satan at any moment, but He permits him to exist and to tempt people. Through these temptations and challenges brought by Satan, the Lord strengthens His disciples. He allows Satan to operate, not because He approves of him, but because even this can bring about good results. This is another example of the mind-blowing dialectics of God. The Lord does not bless Satan or endorse his actions, but He allows this hostile spirit, who seeks to destroy, to exist, limiting his power as needed. Through this, the Lord can bring about good outcomes. Yet, He warns sinners, "Do not sin again." We must not think, "Oh, I can sin or doubt, and it will bring good results." No, as long as we remain in the truth, we must strive to preserve it. If there is a need for some antithesis in our lives to help us grow toward synthesis in the Lord, He will allow it. We should not seek out sin or doubt as a means to grow in Christ.

Having said that, we now turn to the destructive dialectics of the devil. He is like a monkey trying to imitate God. He is called the ruler, the king, the prince of this world because he gains control over people through their passions, desires, and sins. He tries to play God, but he is not God. The results of his dialectics are death, destruction, sin, and hell—these are the fruits of his work. A good example of this can be seen in one of the videos I recorded a long time ago, titled *The Roulette of the Devil*. The devil often changes faces. For instance, in the 20th century, when most people drifted far from God, we saw the rise of the masses. People were cut off from their traditions, thrust into industrial production, and separated from one another by social distancing—not the kind we experience today, but a distancing from their traditions, families, and communities. This was one of the devil's tactics, creating alienation and spiritual emptiness. 

The devil's destructive dialectics aim to lead people away from God, but the Lord, in His infinite wisdom, can still bring good out of even the darkest situations. Let us remain steadfast in the truth, trusting in the Lord's providence and wisdom, and resist the devil's schemes, knowing that his end is destruction, while the Lord's purpose is always life and salvation.

And in this way, they became a mass. These masses were brainwashed by the devil, and part of this mass turned to socialism and communism, while another part turned to capitalism, mass culture, labor, and pop culture. These two camps emerged, and what they had in common was that both were ruled by Mammon. On one side, the communist camp, there was the promise of a bright future to be built through atheism—no God, only material production and materialistic ideals. While there were some lofty ideals, everything ultimately boiled down to materialism, well-being, and prosperity. On the capitalist side, there was also a focus on profit and the growth of production, but with an emphasis on freedom—freedom of religion, but also freedom to sin, which became increasingly evident. Morality was reduced to professional ethics, and later, consumerism took hold, with an obsession over material goods, prosperity, and well-being.

These two camps, though seemingly opposed, shared a common root in materialism and the rejection of God. Then came a synthesis, also inspired by the devil, which combined the worst aspects of both systems. From capitalism, it took the unchecked sin and consumerism, and from communism, it took the totalitarian control and regime. The result is something even worse, which is what we are witnessing today. On a societal level, people are cut off from God, though on an individual level, Christians—those who are part of the body of Christ—should not be afraid. They must understand that things are more complicated than they appear. The devil is constantly using conflicts to divide and conquer. Whether it’s political divisions like the blue and green camps in Taiwan, monarchism versus democracy, or other ideological splits, the devil thrives on creating division. In almost every deep debate, there are two opposing camps, and this is the devil's strategy: divide and conquer.

Whenever we see a new trend, ideology, or movement, we must ask ourselves: Is this part of the devil's divide-and-conquer tactic? Is he masking himself, pitting one side against another, each with a kernel of truth but ultimately leading to destruction? In almost all conflicts, whether wars or ideological battles, the hostility and division come from the devil. It is very rare to see a clear battle between God on one side and the devil on the other. To engage in such a spiritual battle, we must be spiritual warriors, not political or military ones. We need spiritual weapons—not money or material power, but the strength and power of God's Word, the life in Christ, to withstand these schemes.

May we be wise, strong, and decisive in following Christ, refusing to be dragged into false directions by the deceitful schemes of the devil. May God bless you with wisdom and fill your hearts with His love. Christ is risen!
