# The New Year will give us Unique Opportunities

Dear brothers and sisters, we are approaching the new year, and even though the secular new year is not a church celebration, it almost coincides with Christmas, with the Nativity of the Lord and our expectations for the new life with Him. So today, I want to take this opportunity to share with you some thoughts about the year that is passing and especially about the year that is upcoming.

As Christians, the great virtue for us is thankfulness. First of all, we should be thankful to the Lord for the year that is almost over, for all the joyful things, and especially for the sorrowful and painful things that the Lord allowed to happen so that we can be challenged, grow, gain experience, and become better. We should also express repentance to the Lord for everything that we have not done, that He was expecting us to do in this past year, but we did not do what we were supposed to do, or did not do it well enough. This is the greatest grief and sorrow that we can have, okay? Not about what happened in politics, technology, or elsewhere—no, the main thing is us and the Lord. For the Lord, the relationship between His children and Himself is what matters; everything else is secondary. We need to understand this spiritually.

Having said that, let us look into the upcoming year. First of all, we need to distinguish two things, okay? The worldly affairs, turmoil, and crises that are coming—and we can be almost sure that they are coming, maybe not this year, but the next year, but they are coming soon, okay? And the spiritual realm, which is what really matters because the real world is happening in the spiritual realm, and there are no earthly ways to solve those spiritual problems. Some people think that if we sign a peace treaty or provide better healthcare, things are going to get better. Then we are worldly if we think that can solve spiritual problems. But as Christians, we have to be concerned first and foremost about the spiritual struggle and warfare that is going on.

This is why the first thing I wanted to share with you is my hope that we are not emotionally involved or dragged into all those narratives we hear every day in the media, which are constantly trying to program us, okay? Think about this: the war, taxes, tariffs, or whatever—just this, this, this is what matters. We need to break away from that dependency and emotional involvement in all those issues. Who is going to be the president? What is he going to do after coming into office? These kinds of things. We should not be drawn into that, okay? Yes, we know it is going on, but it is not something that is touching us so much, okay? So this is the first thing we need to do if we want to remain loyal to Christ. Because if we lose peace over worldly matters, the peace that comes from above would not matter. We would lose Christ in the midst of all that turmoil that is coming. So this is the first thing I want to say before talking about some details.

The Church is both on earth and in the heavens; it is uniting. On the cross, the Lord united and brought peace to the earthly and heavenly things. So we cannot avoid being part of the earthly reality—the things that are going on with us, with our families, with our friends, with our parish. And we need to be ready for the challenges to come. I am not a political or economic observer, to be sure. So today, I am not going to get into a detailed analysis of some of those issues which are out there. But I want to indicate some of the things that might occur quite likely in this coming year or maybe within a couple of years, very soon.

That we need to be ready because they have a spiritual context, spiritual implications, I would say. It's not just a secular thing. What are those? First, one thing that is coming is digital currencies. In Russia, they've announced that they will introduce digital currency widely on July 1, 2025. What is digital currency? You could do your research. Most of you already know what it means. How is this preparation for the New World Order, the new version of the New World Order, which will bring humanity closer to the kingdom of the Antichrist in some way? We need to be ready for that. This is something to watch out for. We don't want to become victims of this regime.

One other remark: basically, whatever crisis or change happens in this world, for us Christians, it is an opportunity to give a better testimony of our loyalty to Christ. Let's face it this way. Some people are very pessimistic and think, "Oh, it's just Satan overcoming humanity, and it's all over, it's all done. Humans are accepting this, so it's all just going to hell, and we're all going to hell." This is a heavy section because, for us Christians, this is nothing more than another opportunity to testify, to witness our love for Christ, to witness our faith, and to witness our willingness to sacrifice for Christ. Without these challenges, we wouldn't have this opportunity. Maybe we would have something else, but it would be different. I would tell you that if everything is peaceful and fine, and everyone is spiritually asleep and slowly going to hell, it might be much more difficult to wake up and much more difficult to testify. This is just something for you to think about. I'm not saying that crises and all these satanic agendas are fine, good, or useful—no. But we, as Christians, have to take it, as long as God allows such things to happen, as an opportunity.

And I would say that the last two tests, we've failed—most people, most Christians, including Orthodox, maybe not so much, but also failed. I'm talking about the sickness and the war, the recent two big calamities that came upon Earth. We've failed, okay? So, the coming ones—if we are not faithful to Christ, if we don't become spiritually sound and strong, we will fail. If we don't learn how to rely on Christ, we will also fail. We will become victims of this deceit that is coming upon the whole Earth, according to the prophecies. According to Saint Apostle Paul, who said in Thessalonians chapter 2 that the Lord will allow the spirit of deception to capture all the people on Earth—most of the people—we don't want to be among them. So, that was the first thing to expect.

The other thing to be ready for is the abolition—or not the abolition, but the prohibition—of the canonical Church in Ukraine, which has been announced. Now, there are only five months left, so it's going to be implemented at the end of March—sorry, May—the end of May 2025. This is a big thing because it's a huge canonical Orthodox Church of Christ on the territory of Ukraine, and it will be forbidden; it will become illegal. What exactly is going to happen, we don't know for sure. But these are serious things that the devil is also planning. He's planning to do something about it, so we also need to pray strongly and see how this evil plan unfolds, or if it's stopped, or what's going to happen. We'll see.

Another thing that is coming in this upcoming year, with the big political change that has taken place this year—especially with the elections in the US and in most countries of the world—now we can expect big changes.

What exactly is going to happen is hard to say for sure. Will we have a war with Iran—US and Iran—or some conflict between the US and China? Or something else in the Middle East? Or are we going to have a global tariff, the breaking up of the whole economic system? Are we going to have something like that? We'll see, but this is also something that will be coming, and it will pave the way for the kingdom of the Antichrist. We cannot be naive. I hope people are not naive, thinking there are good guys and bad guys in the government, and the good guys are winning, or something like that. We need to be ready for the worst. From the past, we can say that the people implementing all these things are tools of the devil—let's put it this way—consciously or unconsciously. But they will do only as much as the Lord allows them to do. We need to be sure about that, so there’s no need to worry too much.

The fourth thing we could expect would be anything—any tribulation. Just be ready for that. I'm not trying to be apocalyptic here, but just be ready for whatever may come. Be it hunger, poverty, nuclear war, I don’t know, another big pandemic—much worse, like Ebola or something like that—or it could be anything: a technological shutdown, a computer virus spreading everywhere, an electricity shutdown, or something else. It could be anything, brothers and sisters. We need to be ready for that, and we need to remain loyal to Christ. In a moment, I will share what we can do to get ready for all these things—to be spiritually prepared. Because the devil wants your soul. To him, your soul is much more important than the whole world. So, if you fail today, tomorrow, or next year, that would be his victory—far more significant than causing an economic crisis, for example.

Basically, this is how they operate—these occultists, Satanists. If they cannot achieve their goals peacefully, they will do it through war, through crisis, by breaking humanity. This is their method. So, we need to be ready for that, and we need to be ready to give a better testimony of our love and dedication to Christ in such situations.

There was a great book by a saint, Eugene Pozilanyan, who wrote in Russia during the First World War. The book was called *In Quietness and in the Tempest*. It means that we need to remain loyal to God, faithful to Him, no matter whether it is quiet times or tempest, turmoil, war, revolution—whatever. The heart of a Christian should have peace, no matter what. No matter the news, no matter what is happening, with Christ, we have peace from above. This is something that is much more precious to us than anything else, because our hope, our comfort, is not in this world—it is in the next world, in the heavens, in Him, in our Lord.

So, I would summarize my advice for this upcoming year in five statements—five goals to set. I would advise setting these five goals:

1. **Spiritual life must become the core of our life.** The Jesus Prayer, hesychasm, life in Christ, with Christ—this has to become the direction, the core, the absolutely necessary part of our daily life. Let’s set this goal, brothers and sisters.

2. **A very active Eucharistic life.** We need to be living from one Eucharist to the next Eucharist—Eucharist to Eucharist. Confession and Eucharist.

Confession and Eucharist. This must be at the center of our lives. No matter what happens—even if everything is falling apart, even if the whole world is going nuts, going crazy, and anything is happening—we must live from one Eucharist to the next Eucharist. From one Eucharist to the next Eucharist, we will win—spiritually and physically. We will give the right testimony of our love and faith.

The third goal is to **cut all addictions**. No matter if it’s a digital addiction, an addiction to a habit, watching movies, going for a walk, or communicating with someone—any addiction, anything we’re dependent on, we have to break away from it. We must depend only on Christ and become spiritually free. This is done through fasting. Whoever has tried to break away from these things knows how hard it is. It’s much harder to do than to say. May the Lord give us strength on this path. This is a big task, brothers and sisters. Let’s pay great attention to fasting—to killing, mortifying our old self on the cross, and squeezing our desires. "I want to buy this, I want that." No. We must restrict ourselves. We live not for these things; we live for the Lord.

The fourth goal is to **seek strong spiritual people**. We are not dependent on people, but it is important to have some. We are saved as a Church, not just individually. When tough times come, we need to know—or at least communicate with—people who are not "nuts." If everyone goes nuts, we need to know some people who are not. We’ve seen with the past two tests—the sickness and the war—that most people failed, including Orthodox Christians, including priests, including bishops. So, you can check: have these people understood what happened? If until now they haven’t realized the deceit, they will not be able to withstand what is coming next. So, let us be ready for that. Let us set this task of seeking faithful priests and communities that can remain spiritual no matter what happens. If mobile communications fail, if everything fails, we need to know where they live. We can go to them, see them, and help each other. This is also important.

The fifth and final goal is to **get much more serious about our ministry**. We need to actively minister to the Lord and bring forth fruits of faith every day. Let’s set this goal for the upcoming year: every day, I want to leave with the feeling that I have brought fruits of my faith to the Lord. Not just making money, feeding my family, or doing regular things like everyone else—like pagans or Muslims do. We have a special task: to bring forth fruits of faith through ministry, through spiritual life, through changing and growing in virtue. There must be this ministry, and it has to be every day. The Lord said that if the sycamore tree doesn’t bear fruit, next year He will come and cut it down. He wanted to do it this year, but He was persuaded to wait one more year. But if it doesn’t bear fruit again, He will cut it. This is the greatest reminder to us: we need to bear fruit. If we bear fruit, we will not be cut down by Christ, no matter what else happens. Even if everything collapses, we will not collapse. We will remain with Christ. This link to true life will preserve us in faith, in truth, and in holiness. This is the goal.

Otherwise, He will cut us. In what way? Either it will be a spiritual cutting, or it will be that we will die, or something else—suffering, I don’t know. But there will be this cutting unless we rectify our lives and begin bringing forth fruits of faith every day. Brothers and sisters, let us focus on these spiritual goals. Let us not relax and simply enjoy the joyful celebration of the new year. Let us be ready for spiritual warfare. Let us be vigilant and study the Word of God, becoming His soldiers—better soldiers. We are already soldiers, but let us become better soldiers, overthrowing every evil within and without. For us, this must become much, much more. Our self-awareness as ministers and warriors of Christ must grow day by day.

May the Lord grant us such spiritual gifts—strength, wisdom, direction, and guidance—and make us victorious in whatever challenges are to come. Amen. God bless, brothers and sisters, and happy new year!
