# The New Martyrs of Russia Teach Us True Christianity

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a time when everyone has their own idea about Christianity, about the Gospel, and we wonder what the right way is. Of course, we know that in the Protestant world, there are thousands of different congregations. Everyone reads the Gospel but has different ideas about what it means to be a true Christian. Eventually, we come to the Orthodox faith, which offers us the true faith. But even within the Orthodox Church, it can be very difficult to find the right example or spiritual guidance that will help us become true Christians. There are many reasons for this.

One reason is that we are selfish and don't really want any guidance. That's one of the reasons. Another reason is that we are lazy; even when we know that we need to read the Gospel, pray, and fast, we don't do it. Additionally, there are few spiritual pastors, and not many Orthodox Christians provide us with a vivid example of Christian life in our day and age. With all these difficulties, it becomes especially challenging to become a good, true Christian, to have the right worldview, and to lead a holy life.

To overcome this problem, we look to the examples of saints. However, most of these examples are of ancient saints, the most famous ones. We perceive their stories as fairy tales or nice legends about great heroes who lived thousands of years ago, who prayed on a pillar for 80 years or did other extraordinary things. We think, "Well, that's not for me. I appreciate that it's great, but what does it mean for me?"

To help us overcome this problem, we have the new martyrs of Russia, and actually, China also has new martyrs, though fewer in number, and we don't know much about them. There are 222 new martyrs of China who were martyred in Beijing in 1900. Today, I want to talk about the new martyrs of Russia. Many Orthodox people, including Russians, don't have a deep appreciation or understanding of the new martyrs. There are many reasons for this.

Very often, when we talk about the new martyrs today, we approach them from a secular perspective that we don't fully grasp. Why were there martyrs? Well, there was a political change, a new government, and they were not in line with the new policy. The Bolshevik government came, persecuted them, and destroyed them as political rivals and obstacles. This is seen as a political matter, unrelated to Christianity, unlike the early martyrs who were asked, "Do you believe in Christ?" and when they said, "I do," they were killed. If they denied Christ, they were spared. So, when people had this choice, they died for their faith, for confessing their love for Christ.

However, things are not always so clear-cut. Today, I want to begin by giving you some clues on how to think about this. I truly believe that understanding the new martyrs of Russia can help us understand what is happening right now and give us a better worldview. Part of the reason why many Russians now support the ongoing war is that they don't understand the new martyrs of Russia. They don't understand what happened. They might even think they are Orthodox, but they are still deceived by the Antichrist, who was behind the Bolshevik government and who is still behind much of the government today. Because what's happening now, the two sides are playing the same game, as I've talked about before.

All right, so to understand why they were killed and why they are important for us, let's begin by examining the reasons. I can tell you that the stated reasons were not the true motivations for killing them; they were merely political tricks, formalities that the Bolsheviks used to justify their actions. These political accusations were not the real reason behind the persecutions. We see this in the many tortures and the satanic joy the perpetrators experienced while carrying out these acts. Many of the murders were ritualistic, carried out with great zeal as they destroyed churches, clergy, and everyone associated with them.

So, what was the true reason? The true reason behind this massive movement, the Red Terror, which began immediately after the revolution (the revolution took place on October 25, and by October 31, the first priest was martyred near Petrograd), was not political but spiritual. From 1917 until 1939, or even 1942, when the persecution truly ended, approximately 300,000 priests were persecuted, and around 5 million or more regular Orthodox faithful were killed. Of course, not everyone who died was a saint. To date, we recognize roughly 2,000 new martyrs by name, as determined by a commission for canonization. However, the actual number of saints is likely much higher—perhaps at least half of those killed by the Bolsheviks were martyrs.

Why were they killed? Why did this brutal episode occur in Russian history? The true reason was Christianity. When we read the diaries of people who lived during that time and examine the instances of these killings, it becomes clear that it was Christ whom the Bolsheviks were trying to eradicate from Russia. They were not fighting monarchism, capitalism, or any other ideology—they were fighting Christ.

Let me provide some examples. When you have a Christian worldview and live according to Christian principles, you sacrifice yourself for others and love your enemies. Such a worldview is incompatible with the communist or Bolshevik ideology, which thrives on class hatred and strife. Christians do not believe in hating exploiters or other classes, nor do they accept the idea that class struggle leads to progress. People with such a Christian worldview were seen as obstacles to the Bolshevik vision of a "bright future" and a "paradise on earth." If people continued to go to church, pray, and live according to Christian values, they would not support the Bolshevik agenda. The totalitarian government wanted a society that fully embraced its ideology, and anything that did not fit had to be eliminated. The most effective way to achieve this was through terror—torture, murder, and fear—to ensure that everyone else was too terrified to resist or would flee the country.

This understanding is crucial for us today. Most Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians alive today are descendants of people who either supported socialism at some point or did not openly oppose it. We must recognize this. Most of us belong to the generation that, in one way or another, allowed Christ to be chased away. If we do not understand this history, we cannot effectively combat the spirit of the Antichrist, which still lingers in Russia today. We cannot discern who is good and who is evil, nor can we fully grasp what is happening around us. Even though today's government is not Soviet or communist, it has inherited many elements from that era. The spirit of the Antichrist manifests in many shapes and forms, and recognizing this is essential for understanding our present reality.

It's not only a Soviet or Bolshevik issue, but for now, let's focus on the Bolsheviks and the Soviet regime. This ideology pushed people toward materialism. People were taught to prioritize well-being—not just personal well-being, but the well-being of the country. However, it was still rooted in materialism: production, economics, and technology. Materialistic well-being in this world became the highest value. Everything else was considered worthless. If you didn't buy into this ideology, you were cast out. 

Moreover, this system bred distrust. You couldn't trust your neighbor, your family, or anyone else, because they might report you to the authorities for making a joke or expressing dissent. The principle was clear: you could only trust yourself. This distrust was intentional—it prevented people from uniting against the government. People became suspicious of one another, spiritually and morally broken. This entire system was antithetical to Christian values, Christian life, and the Gospel. These are just a few examples of what the Bolsheviks introduced, and many of these elements persist today, not just in Russia but around the world.

Socialism was merely one tool used by the Antichrist, and Russia became the instrument of this tool. The Antichrist employs different tools in different times, places, and contexts. The Bolshevik era was a stark example of how the Antichrist revealed his true nature. Most of those who were persecuted, killed, or destroyed were not necessarily opposing the government directly. Instead, they were resisting the Antichristian forces that had infiltrated society. Some didn't even actively resist—they simply wanted to live a Christian life. But even that was intolerable. The Antichristian machine of destruction was created, and anyone who fell into its grasp was killed.

Of course, people are weak. Many who were caught in this death machine gave up, cooperated, accused others, and were broken. They did not become saints. But some remained faithful to Christ until the end, faithful to the truth. Christ said, "I am the truth." These individuals loved Christ, prayed, and lived Christian lives. We can see this in their diaries, memoirs, and other surviving records from those terrible years. There are countless examples of such faithfulness.

The entire system was Antichristian. For instance, in one village, a priest was killed by the Bolsheviks. His wife died from grief and suffering, leaving behind two small children, perhaps four or five years old. The entire village was too afraid to help these children because they were considered "enemies of the nation." Helping them would have meant death. These innocent children were left locked in their house during winter, told not to go outside or cause trouble. They were slowly dying. Occasionally, people would secretly bring them food at night. Eventually, one child was taken by a government employee to a facility that collected such children, but only one could be taken. The other child was left to die. A distant relative of the priest, a young woman, came and took the remaining child to another village to care for him. This act of compassion led to her arrest and execution by the Bolsheviks. 

This story illustrates how even basic human compassion—let alone high Christian values—was incompatible with the satanic nature of that government. The system was designed to crush anything that resembled love, mercy, or humanity. It was a machine of destruction, and those who resisted it, even in small ways, paid the ultimate price.

And you want to say that it was just political? No, it was not merely political—it was anti-Christian in nature, aimed at destroying Christianity. This is what truly happened. From the example of these new martyrs, who remained faithful to the end and died for their faith, we see that it was Christ in Russia who was martyred on Golgotha. We can learn a great deal from these people: how they viewed the world, how they understood prayer for their enemies, and how they discerned the true nature of communism, capitalism, society, globalism, and the divisions between East and West. By examining their lives, we can gain a much clearer understanding of these issues through the prism of their holiness.

I highly advise everyone to read more about the new martyrs of Russia. Find a martyr whose story resonates with you, and read their diaries, letters, or writings. Learn more about them, ask for their prayers, and appreciate what it means to be a true Christian in the modern world. Understand how to fight evil, both within ourselves and in the world around us. Do not be swayed by social media, mass media, or the spirit of this world, regardless of which political party or ideology they promote—right, left, green, or otherwise. These forces seek to drag us astray.

Let us remain faithful to the Lord. Let us feel that we do not belong to the spirit of this world. Let us recognize how harmful this spirit can be, distance ourselves from it, and instead align ourselves with the company of these new martyrs. Let us be faithful and loyal to Christ, even to the end, even if it requires martyrdom. May the Lord help us, bless us, and teach us to live according to His Spirit—the Spirit of God, the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of holiness. May the Lord be with you. Amen. God bless.
