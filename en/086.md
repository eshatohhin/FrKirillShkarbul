# Pentecost vs Anti-Pentecost

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Pentecost!  
The Holy Church is celebrating Pentecost, the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, which occurred 50 days after the resurrection of Christ.  
This is the culmination, the final result of Christ’s entire life, for He rose again and appeared to the apostles for 40 days before ascending into heaven in glory. Yet, all of this was so that the apostles could receive His glory, His power, and His teachings through the descent of the Holy Spirit, which occurred 10 days after His ascension.  

On this Feast of Pentecost—which was also the Old Testament Pentecost—the Holy Spirit descended and established the new Pentecost, the new covenant between humanity and God. The old Pentecost celebrated the establishment of the law, when God gave Moses and the people of Israel the commandments on Mount Sinai, forming the Old Testament Church.  
But now, the fullness of time has come, and the true New Testament Church, the New Israel, has been established through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles.  

This event brought about three outcomes:  
First, the apostles became one. They achieved unity of mind, unity of heart, and shared the same understanding of the truth that Christ had given them. They were united in will, all eager to proclaim the Gospel and serve Christ.  

Second, they transcended all national and linguistic barriers. They preached the Gospel, and people from different nations could understand them. This overcame the divisions between nations that had existed since the time of Babylon, the ancient Babylon. The barriers of language and nationality were dissolved through the diverse tongues they spoke.  

Third, they attained a metaphysical dimension to their unity by being united to the head of the Church, Christ Himself. This metaphysical reality became manifest, revealing that they were no longer merely individuals but one body—the unseen yet known body of Christ.  

These three outcomes were made possible by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. These gifts were manifold, manifesting both in supernatural abilities and in the apostles’ unity of mind, courage, and boldness to preach the Gospel. Immediately after receiving the Spirit, they left the house where they had been praying and began to proclaim the Gospel fearlessly, undeterred by the Pharisees, the Jews, or any threats of persecution. They bore witness to the Gospel with unwavering resolve.  

Today, we must reflect on two things. In modern times, we do not see as many supernatural gifts bestowed upon Christians, leading some to question whether the Holy Spirit’s gifts have ceased or if we no longer share in communion with the Holy Spirit. Some turn to sects, cults, or the charismatic movement, attempting to force the Holy Spirit to descend. This is futile, for the Holy Spirit comes when He wills, not by human coercion. Such practices lead people to spiritual ruin, leaving them empty, wounded, and even vulnerable to demonic influence.  

The essence of the apostles’ experience was not their supernatural abilities but their unity, love for one another, and their unwavering commitment to Christ. This is what the Church today requires: unity founded on Christ Himself, not on anything else. Let us strive for this unity, rooted in love and truth, as we bear witness to the Gospel in our time.

Not because we are from the same country, share the same church jurisdiction, speak the same language, or anything else, but because we are united with Christ and love Christ.  
This is what we often lack today, and it is the root of many internal problems within the Church—divisions between different jurisdictions, conflicts among clergy, and other fractures. These divisions arise from a lack of the Holy Spirit’s presence.  

Therefore, we must reflect deeply on Pentecost. It is not merely a celebration of a historical event; we must consider what it means for us today. One crucial aspect is this: the unity and peace among people, the elimination of wars, do not necessarily come from Pentecost or the Holy Spirit.  

There is a substitute for Pentecost: Babylon. Babylon represents when people seek to build a common project not rooted in the Gospel, one that lacks Christ as its foundation. There are many local and global initiatives of this nature, uniting people for purposes other than Christ. For example, consider globalization. Some countries find it more profitable to cooperate—production happens in China, resources come from Russia, and technology originates in the United States. These globalized systems combine the strengths of different nations, and many embrace them because they bring higher standards of living, greater welfare, and peace. People avoid war because they recognize that conflict would harm their mutual interests.  

While this unity may seem beneficial, it has nothing to do with Christ. Ultimately, the Antichrist will unite everyone in this way. The New Babylon, the anti-Pentecost, will also exhibit three characteristics:  
1. A unifying ideology that brings people together.  
2. The erasure of national boundaries, as we already see in many nations where people coexist without Christ, simply for convenience or partnership.  
3. A metaphysical dimension, as seen in socialism, which sought to build unity without Christ. Socialism had a strong ideology and even a quasi-religious aspect, with the worship of Lenin and the Communist Party. It claimed its own spirit, a metaphysical reality apart from God.  

This is the anti-Pentecost. Today, the new model of unity will likely combine materialism (mammon) and socialism but will lack a strong ideological foundation. Instead, a new ideology will emerge to underpin the next wave of globalization following the pandemic, forming the basis of a new world order.  

When we see people living peacefully, cooperating, and coexisting, it is not inherently bad. Peace is good, and the absence of war is desirable. However, we must recognize that this unity is fundamentally different from the unity of Pentecost, where the apostles and disciples were united through the Holy Spirit in their love for Christ.  

The New Babylon harbors enmity toward the true Pentecost. This is why, even as people unite economically, there is a growing tendency to divide along religious lines. We see more splits, sects, schisms, and divisions. The devil works in this way: he unites people on the foundation of the New Babylon while sowing division among those who seek unity in truth and Pentecost.  

Let us, therefore, strive for true unity—not through worldly systems or ideologies, but through the Holy Spirit, rooted in Christ and His love. Only then can we overcome the divisions of this age and bear witness to the Gospel in its fullness.

This is the reality we live in, and we must discern what is happening, not confusing one thing with another. We ask our Lord to send us the Holy Spirit so that we, as Christians, may be united in the body of Christ, standing together in strength and overcoming weakness, even when the path seems difficult or mundane.  

May the joy of Pentecost be with you. Merry Pentecost!  
God bless.
