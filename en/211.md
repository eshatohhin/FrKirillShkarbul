# Pentecost The Holy Spirit vs other spirits

Dear brothers and sisters, we approach Holy Pentecost, and at this time, both before and after Pentecost, we reflect deeply on the Holy Spirit. This is the culmination of the entire cycle that begins with the preparation for Great Lent, followed by Great Lent itself, Holy Passion Week, Pascha, the 40 days after Pascha leading to the Ascension, and now we arrive at the fruits of this journey. The goal of the Lord is to establish His Church and to enter into the New Covenant, which is fulfilled at Pentecost. This Covenant is realized when He says, "I will send you the power from on high," and adds, "If I do not go, I cannot send you the Holy Spirit." It is through the power of the Holy Spirit that we are united with Christ and become one in the body of the Church.

There are two common misconceptions about the Holy Spirit. The first is the belief that the Holy Spirit is not relevant to one's personal life. Some think, "I am just a regular person; I am not a saint. I cannot change so much to become holy, so the Holy Spirit is not for me. It is something we read about in books or in the lives of the saints, but it is too lofty, too holy for me to experience." This is a tragic misunderstanding. The second error, perhaps even more significant, is the assumption that every feeling or experience is attributed to the Holy Spirit. Some sects emphasize ecstatic experiences, such as speaking in tongues, falling down, losing consciousness, or being overcome by uncontrollable laughter, claiming these as manifestations of the Holy Spirit. These phenomena, however, are not genuine expressions of the Holy Spirit. They may stem from psychological disturbances, emotional excesses, or even evil spirits, but they are not the work of the Holy Spirit.

Today, I wish to share a few words about the Holy Spirit, as this is the time when we pray for His presence. If we desire to renew our covenant with the Lord, we must actively seek and receive the Holy Spirit. It is not a passive "maybe"; it requires intentional communication with the Holy Spirit. 

What does this mean? First, the common division of the human being into body, soul, and spirit is an oversimplification. Typically, we think of the body as the physical aspect, the soul as the psychological and personality dimension, and the spirit as the part responsible for communication with God and spiritual matters. However, this is not entirely accurate. The Spirit is not a "part" of us. There is the Holy Spirit, and there are other spirits. When we speak of the "spirit" of someone, we refer to a mode or frequency, much like a vibration or state of being. For example, we might say, "I am not in good spirits today," or "I am in high spirits," indicating a temporary state rather than an inherent part of our being. The Holy Spirit is described as filling us as vessels, a concept rooted in biblical understanding, even from the Old Testament. King David prayed, "Do not take Your Holy Spirit from me," acknowledging that the Spirit can be given or withdrawn.

The Lord Himself emphasized the importance of attitude, saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit," referring to those who have emptied themselves of their own spirit to be filled with His.

What is my own spirit? It is the mode or frequency, if you will, that is shaped by my inner world—my thoughts about myself, my goals, and my internal passions. If my soul is tainted, if my heart is filled with impure thoughts or evil intentions, this will attract a corresponding spirit. This spirit becomes intertwined with my personality, as it aligns with the way I am accustomed to thinking and acting. For example, if I have a certain self-image—perhaps as "John Smith, PhD, the professor"—this identity carries with it a particular spirit. I present myself in a certain way, dress accordingly, and behave in a manner consistent with this persona. This is what is meant by "personal spirit."

The Lord said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit," referring to those who have emptied themselves of their own spirit. Humility, therefore, is the absence of this personal spirit. It involves dismantling the grandiose self-images we construct—whether as a professor, a professional, or any other identity—and recognizing that these are not our true essence. If we cling to our own spirit, why would we need the Holy Spirit? The Lord cannot enter a heart that is already filled with its own spirit. This is why those who are attached to their personal spirit are not blessed. To be blessed, we must rid ourselves of our own spirit, crushing and destroying the false images we hold about ourselves.

What happens when we receive the Holy Spirit? There are misconceptions here as well. Some believe that receiving the Holy Spirit will result in overwhelming joy, ecstatic feelings, or other dramatic experiences. However, the Lord Himself said that the kingdom of heaven does not come in a noticeable way. It is not something external that can be pointed to, saying, "Here it is," or "There it is." Rather, the kingdom of heaven is within us, but only when we are in communion with the Holy Spirit. It is not a constant, unchanging presence; it is a dynamic relationship. The Holy Spirit does not manifest in predictable physical sensations—warmth, a breeze, or light—though these may occur as exceptions, as when the Holy Spirit descended as fire upon the apostles. The true sign of the Holy Spirit's presence is a transformation of the heart.

So, how do we know if we are in communion with the Holy Spirit? How can we discern that we are on the right spiritual path? Let us begin by reflecting on a poor choice we have made in our lives. We all have moments we regret, decisions we wish we could undo. When we examine the mindset we were in at that time, we often find that we believed we were making the best choice for ourselves in that moment. We were driven by a passion—whether greed, lust, vainglory, or another—and this passion carried with it a certain spirit. This spirit influenced our thoughts, our judgment, and our desires, aligning them with the passion at hand. Even if we knew, deep down, that what we were doing was wrong, the spirit associated with that passion overpowered our better judgment. 

This is why the Holy Spirit is essential. It counteracts these destructive spirits, aligning our hearts and minds with God's will rather than our own passions. To receive the Holy Spirit, we must first empty ourselves of our own spirit, humbling ourselves before God and opening our hearts to His transformative presence. Only then can we truly experience the blessings of the Holy Spirit and walk in communion with Him.

but very often, especially before we became Christians, we acted under the influence of a spirit that convinced us our actions were good and right. We believed we were supposed to do those things, even if they were misguided. This same principle applies to our desire for the Holy Spirit. When He comes into our lives, it becomes easier and more natural for us to pray, to sacrifice for Christ, to let go of attachments, and to make choices aligned with the Holy Gospel. What once felt unnatural—opening the Gospel, praying, or living sacrificially—becomes a joyful and natural response to the Holy Spirit's presence.

The more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more our judgment, inner world, and life direction align with the teachings of Christ. We gain the strength and clarity to live according to the Gospel, and many aspects of our lives begin to change. Our part in this process is to prepare our hearts as clean vessels, ready to receive the Holy Spirit. This is especially important during this time. Anything in our lives that we know is wrong will hinder us from receiving the Holy Spirit. We must cleanse our hearts, ensuring there is nothing within us that opposes God's will. He will not enter a heart that is filled with filth, selfishness, or sin.

We live in a world that shapes us with its own spirit—its logic, values, and priorities. This is why it often feels unnatural to truly live as Christians and receive the Holy Spirit. We must be willing to break away from the world's influence. This is why the saints were often misunderstood or even called foolish by those around them. People could not comprehend why the saints would sacrifice their lives for someone who was crucified, or why they would reject worldly success and comfort. But the saints saw with spiritual eyes. They craved Christ's kingdom, and the Holy Spirit empowered them to live lives of extraordinary love and testimony.

Christ warned that our enemies might often be those closest to us—our relatives and friends. They may urge us to pursue worldly goals: "You need to make more money, get a better job, marry this person, or achieve this or that." While their intentions may be good, their advice is rooted in earthly benefits, not eternal ones. As the Apostle Paul teaches, the flesh follows its own desires, and the fruits of the flesh are death and corruption. But the fruits of the Spirit are life eternal. Our goal is to live according to the Spirit, not the flesh. This is the choice we must make, the desire we must cultivate, and the direction we must aim our lives toward.

Let us ask the Lord to help us in this evil and corrupted world, a world driven by sin and delusion. May He guide us to be led by the Holy Spirit, not by the false or evil spirits that deceive so many. May we learn to discern spirits, loving only what comes from the Lord and rejecting what belongs to this world. May the Lord's blessing and His Holy Spirit be with you always, preserving you in His grace. May He grant us the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are abundant and varied, for we are in great need of them. These gifts are essential for our spiritual growth and the fulfillment of our calling. May the Lord's blessing be upon you, and may you have a blessed and joyous Pentecost.
