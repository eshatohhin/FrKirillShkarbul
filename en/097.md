# Spiritual situation in Los Angeles

To you, brothers and sisters, today I am in Los Angeles, and I want to share with you my observations and my feelings about this place, about the spiritual atmosphere of what's happening here now. The car behind me is a good illustration of the point I want to make.

I've been to the United States many times and to Los Angeles a few times. But this time, I have some new observations and thoughts that I want to share. What I have discovered is the choice that people are facing between Christ and mammon. Unfortunately, the majority of people have chosen mammon. They have chosen consumption, well-being, and all the material comforts of this earthly life. Here in Los Angeles, in California, we know that this is the avant-garde of capitalism. This is a place that has wealth, that has all the best things that there are—okay? The best technologies, the best products, the best medicine, the best houses in Beverly Hills—anything you want, you can find it here. Maybe it will be expensive, but it’s cheaper than anywhere else, okay? 

Take vaccination, for example. The whole world is struggling to get vaccines. Taiwan doesn’t have it yet. But here, it’s been half a year since you could get the best vaccine available anytime, anywhere. You can choose whatever you like, and there’s no problem. This is just a small example to illustrate that this place has it all, okay? You name it, and it has it.

At the same time, I can see a large number of homeless people on the streets. There are so many homeless, and a lot of psychologically unbalanced people—just crazy, okay? You can see them anywhere, not just in certain neighborhoods. In downtown, in the outskirts, even in places like Beverly Hills, they’re everywhere, okay? And there are a lot of them. They say that they’re trying to force them away, but they’re still everywhere. 

We can see this great social injustice, but there is something that unites these people who are apparently from different social classes and situations. This something is evident, okay? I could see the drugs, the drug use. People on the bus are doing those things, smoking, and the same goes for wealthy people—they also use drugs. The propaganda of Sodom, the scene of Sodom and Gomorrah, okay? You know what I’m talking about. It’s everywhere. Even some churches seem to have that propaganda symbolism of that scene, okay? 

And now, even with the sickness, there is a new outbreak of COVID, and it’s due to these parties and clubs where people are dancing together, packed in every night. Many of these places have that Sodom and Gomorrah style, okay? This lifestyle has open freedom; there’s nothing restricting it, and it’s trying to grasp as many people as possible—both the poor and the rich. The prostitution, the poor providing services for the rich—it’s all related. It’s based on the scene and the greed for money, which is common everywhere. You can feel it everywhere.

This spirit of capitalism, this spirit of rich cars, nice houses, mansions—you can illustrate it with the car behind me. We can see that it has some pretense, some spirit, okay? It’s got some power, some drive to it, but now it’s just a piece of junk, a metal scrap behind me. You can’t ride it; it’s just taking up space, okay? So all of that wealthy stuff is going to end up like that. We’ve seen big empires, like the Soviet Union, destroyed in an instant, okay? Very soon, it became just metal scrap, like we can see here. It’s collecting garbage; this is what’s left behind. Everything is going to become garbage, okay? Just this collector will be going around to collect garbage, and everyone will become garbage, okay? It will all turn to dust.

So all of that is just to trick people, okay? And they become crazy because this mental sickness is something that’s common to both the poor and the rich—all of them suffer. People buy so many drugs in pharmacies; they’re hooked, addicted to these drugs, and need to take them all the time, okay?

So I also asked myself, is there Christ here? I talked to people, visited some bookshops—Christian bookshops, Protestant ones—and some churches. And I can say that yes, there is Christ here, okay? There is Christ here, but it’s very narrow for Him to be here. He is squeezed, and it’s hard for Him to find a place to rest because people are dragged away by something else, by other spirits. 

There are people who are trying to find Christ. There are many—not a majority, of course, but a small minority—who are seeking Christ. But it’s hard to find Him here because all these different sects and churches, many of them, are spiritually corrupt and misleading people more than helping them find Christ. This way of living, these values, this lifestyle—it all makes people feel like they don’t need any religion at all. Or they turn to New Age or something else. Just consume, just buy, and you don’t need any faith, any search for Christ or the Kingdom of Heaven. 

So many theological differences that are important—now, for the majority of people, Christians and non-Christians alike, it’s not important. They just don’t want to read about those things. They’re completely dragged away, separated from this search and craving for Christ. This need is replaced by something else—Antichrist, basically. 

The only hope I have is in Orthodox mission. The Orthodox Church can bring people out of this delusion, out of this shadow of death that is so evident here. But the Orthodox mission here is very weak and very small, and it’s pretty much limited to national groups—Russians, Serbians, Greeks. But it’s important to have a mission that would be noticed by everyone. This melting pot, this English-speaking melting pot, this big culture that is dragging all people into it—it has to hear this true message. There should be a witnessing about the Lord in there, and I don’t see much being done in that sense. 

It’s almost unnoticed by people. If they want to find it, where do they look for it? It’s important to do more. It’s not that nothing has been done—there are American Orthodox Christians, purely American, who do mission work. But it’s very small, minuscule, and there are few people. 

We need to pray more about mission work here in the United States, in the heart of Mammon, in the heart of capitalism. And this capitalism is being replaced. We can see this garbage car—it’s now replacing and throwing out this capitalist thing. What’s coming up is something else, and it’s not going to be closer to Christ.

So let us think more about Christ, let us pray more, and let us not be afraid of anything. Another thing I wanted to say is that here, people are quite educated. Most have a high level of education—not all, of course; the poor often don’t—but the majority, I think, are quite well-educated. Yet, this doesn’t bring them closer to God. Education without spiritual life is worthless. Without spiritual life, with this consumerism, with this serving of Mammon, people think about money, numbers, and consumption. They are easily programmed. You can see that most people think in the exact same way, and this way of thinking is far from logic. 

Take the COVID situation, for example. People are driven by fear. Even when there is complete protection from COVID, they still ask the taxi driver to wear a mask, which is nonsense. So we can see that education doesn’t free people from delusion or from being spiritually asleep. It doesn’t help them think or use their minds. 

These are the things I want to share. I also want to say that even though there are different ethnic groups, and everything is divided among them—for example, drivers are usually Muslims or Arabs, some hotels and parking lots are run by Indian people—all these communities are still grasped and dragged by a common spirit. This is done, I don’t know how, through music, through a sense of belonging to this place, to this common culture. It all pulls them into a shared spirit. 

So it’s important for us to talk to these people, to be present, to challenge this way of life, this spirit, and to bring the message of Christ. We must show that true joy is not found in drugs, not in homosexual parties, not in consumption, nice products, cars, or mansions. True joy is in Christ, in prayer, in the Holy Communion. 

Let us think about how we can contribute to this mission. We are English speakers listening to this video, and we can do something to chase Mammon out and bring people closer to Christ. May the Lord help us in this, and God bless.
