# From Pascha to Pentecost What tasks God gave us in THIS world

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen.  
Today, I am trying a new microphone arrangement. I hope you can hear me well.  
I am currently in Taichung. We had a divine service here yesterday, along with a meeting of our faithful community.  
I want to share with you about mission, which is closely related to what we discussed last time.  
Last time, we talked about how important it is to detach ourselves from the overwhelming flood of information and agendas that consume everyone.  
Today, I want to explore what it means for us, as a church—as the New Israel—to be on this journey from Pascha to Pentecost.  
We are already approaching Pentecost, but it is still worthwhile to reflect on this.  

We live in a world that is building a new Babylon, with its gates and constructions.  
The Lord asked, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?"  
People will be building houses, getting married, buying, selling, and going about their lives.  
Suddenly, judgment will come, and it will be a surprise to everyone.  
We do not want to be caught off guard. We want to live with the Lord every day of our lives.  
Instead of building Babylon, we must focus on building the temple of our souls.  

When I arrived here this time, I was struck by the prevalence of paganism.  
Even in this small place where I am staying, the caretaker is a pagan.  
He has various items related to idol worship, such as sticks for incense and other objects tied to pagan faith.  
It is a reminder that, despite our mission, many around us are still deeply rooted in idolatry.  

Another point is about ourselves. Yesterday, I heard confessions.  
Before we can unite with Christ, we must cleanse our souls.  
We must rid ourselves of passions, garbage, and the dirt within.  
Confession is essential, yet many still struggle with passions and inner turmoil.  
This is a painful and difficult struggle that even Christians face.  

All of this connects to what I want to discuss today.  
If we reflect on Pascha and Pentecost, let us look back to the Old Testament.  
In the Old Testament, there was Pesach and Pentecost, which occurred 50 days after Pesach.  
These were foreshadowings of the future Pascha and Pentecost for the New Israel, the Holy Church.  
The meaning of Pesach is liberation from slavery in Egypt, passing through the Red Sea, and escaping Pharaoh.  
This was no easy feat. The ten plagues and calamities in Egypt caused great suffering for the Jews, who were not yet the people of Israel.  
Their escape was a tremendous struggle.  

Similarly, we experience the struggle of Great Lent and Holy Week leading up to Pascha.  
Pascha brings liberation from death and victory over sin, achieved through Christ’s own Pesach—His suffering, death, and triumph over Hades.  
He had to endure this to break the gates of Hades and bring us salvation.  

However, after the Israelites escaped Egypt, they found themselves in the desert of the Arabian Peninsula.  
They had no certainty about the future. Moses spoke of a promised land, but where was it?  
They had no guarantees, no income, and no clear path forward.  
Yes, they had freedom, but it came with uncertainty and challenges.

Now, no one tells them, but they no longer have the security they had in Egypt.  
Though it was called slavery, it wasn’t entirely unbearable.  
Many of them said, "Let’s go back to Egypt."  
They longed to return because it felt safe and familiar.  
There were good crops, steady income, and stability.  
But now, having gained freedom, they gained it for a purpose.  
The purpose was to establish the covenant with the Lord on Mount Sinai.  
This happened after 50 days of wandering in the wilderness.  
It was necessary for them to be free people so that the Lord could make this covenant with them—not with slaves.  
You cannot make an agreement with someone who is bound to another.  
Just as you cannot marry someone who is already married, the Israelites could not enter into a covenant with God while still enslaved to Pharaoh.  
Only after their liberation could they become the chosen nation of God, tasked with bringing His message to all nations.  

Similarly, in our spiritual journey, the liberation we experience through Pascha is not the final goal.  
Yes, Pascha brings freedom from sin and death through Christ’s resurrection.  
We become children of resurrection, but this is not the end.  
The liberation is given to us so that the Lord can establish a new covenant with us, His disciples.  
This covenant is fulfilled at Pentecost with the descent of the Holy Spirit, establishing the Church, the new Israel.  
The goal is for every Christian to become an apostle, sharing the gospel and bringing the message of salvation to all nations.  
This mission is only possible through the union with the Holy Spirit.  

As the Church, we are not merely individuals.  
When we pray, we say, "Our Father," not "My Father," because we are part of the body of Christ.  
Even in private prayer, the Lord hears us as members of His Church.  
Now, as the Church, we are on the path of renewing our covenant with God.  
For most of us, this is not our first Pentecost.  
Our personal Pentecost occurred at Chrismation, when we received the Holy Spirit after baptism.  
However, we often grow weaker, fall back into sin, and return to our "Egypt."  
Yet, the Lord calls us to renew our union with Him, especially at Pentecost.  
This renewal requires us to crave and expect the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives.  

We must not be distracted by other agendas—what someone is wearing, the economy, military conflicts, or political summits.  
While these things happen, they are not our primary focus.  
Even family matters or career concerns, though important, are not the most critical.  
Our ultimate priority is to renew our covenant with God and prepare our hearts for the coming of the Holy Spirit.

The most important thing is that I, as a member of the Church, am on the journey to Pentecost during these days.  
I am waiting for the Holy Spirit to descend, to guide me, to preserve me in His holiness, and to teach me how to serve Him in ministry.  

So, how do we prepare? What should we do practically?  
Practically, we must keep our hearts clean.  
We must not allow "Egypt" to creep back into our lives.  
We gained resurrection and liberation through Pascha, and we must strive to remain in that liberation.  
We must be careful not to lose our union with the Lord or the gifts He has given us.  
We must guard the spiritual freedom we gained by overthrowing sin and passions.  
Staying in this state is crucial because, without it, we cannot enter into or renew the covenant with God.  

May the Lord grant us the willingness and renewal we seek at Pentecost.  
May He help each of us stay focused on this path and not be distracted or misled by the "Babylonian construction" of this world—whether it is old paganism, new paganism, or the influences of neo-paganism and New Age practices.  

Some of our Russian students ask about yoga or visiting Buddhist temples out of curiosity.  
These practices are also influenced by paganism and can lead us astray.  
May the Lord protect us from all evil, keep us in His holiness, and bless us with the Holy Spirit we eagerly await.  

Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen.  
God bless.
