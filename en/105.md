# Former priest says sermon from the prison what’s going on

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about what is happening in the Orthodox Church, specifically in the Russian Orthodox Church. This will not be about faith or spiritual life per se, but about the actual events that are taking place. I will share with you my own perspective on these events. It is not the absolute truth, as my knowledge and the information I have are limited. However, I feel it is important to discuss because this concerns the Orthodox Church in 2021, not 2000 years ago. These are events happening right now, here and today. 

It is also important because through these events, we gain experience. We see that the Old Testament recounts the life of ancient Israel, of the Old Testament Church. Now, we are the new Israel—not me personally, but the Orthodox Church. In the New Testament, the life of the apostles is about the Church and what happened then. Similarly, what is happening now is also significant, in my view. This situation has both negative and positive aspects, but it shows that the Church is alive. It is not dead. 

I also want to stress that I have love for everyone involved in this situation. This is not gossip or an attempt to criticize anyone. I want to make it clear that I am praying and that I can understand the reasoning behind what everyone does or says. I truly hope that the Lord grants wisdom to all.

The situation involves a monastery and its former priest, Sergei Romanov. Last year, he spoke out against Putin and the patriarch. He held a conspiratorial position, which may have some truth to it—I am not saying it is entirely false. He claimed that evil powers control Russia and declared, "Give me all the power, and I will fix everything in Russia in three days." He also made other statements, such as cursing those who closed churches due to the coronavirus. I spoke with him over the phone last summer when all this was unfolding, so I have some understanding of the situation, though my knowledge is limited.

Recently, we learned that Father Sergei was taken into custody last December and remains in prison. Just recently, a seven-minute sermon he recorded from prison was released online. In this sermon, he urges people not to stir up trouble, to remain peaceful, to pray to God, and to place their reliance on Him. He also asks people to pray for the president and the government. It is clear that his position has changed in this sermon.

Today, I want to discuss his position, the government's actions in Russia, and the Church's role in all of this. There is a talk show on one of the major official channels that has covered this topic, as well as reactions from some members of the Russian elite. For example, Maria Shukchinat, an actress and daughter of a prominent film director, has also commented on the situation.

What we can see from the speech of the former priest—now known as Nicholas Romanov, as he has been defrocked and excommunicated by the Church—is that we must first have compassion for him. He is in prison, and the reason for his imprisonment appears to be fabricated. They claim he was encouraging people to commit suicide, but in reality, he was asking, "Are you ready to die for your country? Are you ready to die for Christ?" This question was reported as incitement, but it seems to have been taken out of context.

And they claimed that this showed he was convincing an immature person underage to commit suicide. This is nonsense. We can understand that it is a fabricated accusation. They simply wanted to silence him, to ensure he would not speak out. Now he is in prison, and his current position, as expressed in his statements, reveals two things. First, it is clear that he has been broken in some way. However, what he is saying now reflects his genuine beliefs—it is not fabricated. This tells us two things. 

First, through his interactions with the officials and those who imprisoned him—and I am sure there has been significant communication between them—he has come to realize that the situation is not as dire as he had claimed. It is not a case of the Antichrist controlling everything. The government is attempting to maintain stability, and this includes providing support to the Church. While there are certainly problems in how Russia is governed, the government is generally supportive of the Church. This is not a persecution akin to Soviet times, nor is it complete indifference. 

This raises another topic: the complex relationship between the Church and the government. Both are using each other in various ways. The government uses the Church, and the Church uses the government. It is a complicated dynamic, but overall, the situation is not as bad for the Church as some might think. The government’s current stance is one of support, and Romanov seems to have come to understand this. That is why he now expresses direct support for the government, urging people to pray for it, avoid excessive involvement, and rely on Christ. This is his main message.

Second, this situation reveals something about the government: there are individuals within it who, if they decide to target someone they dislike—perhaps because that person has said things deemed too extreme—have the means to do so. They can use any method, including fabricated accusations, to silence or punish individuals. This is not to say that the entire government operates this way, but there are people within it who have the power and influence to act in such a manner. However, this is done on an individual level; it is not systematic or indicative of totalitarian control and censorship.

Now, regarding the talk show on the Russian Church channel, it serves two purposes. First, it aims to promote peace and unity, emphasizing that there is no split or quarrel within the Church. It presents a black-and-white narrative: the Church’s position is right and good, while Romanov is portrayed as the bad actor who created division. Second, the show seeks to justify the Church’s official decisions regarding Romanov, portraying them as correct and justified. These are systematic goals, and the outcome is not entirely positive.

One troubling aspect of the talk show is the lack of compassion shown toward Romanov, who served the Church for many years, even decades, and is now accused of wrongdoing. Regardless of his controversial views or sectarian mindset, the Church should demonstrate compassion. As the Church, we are called to care and pray for everyone, especially those who may have been wrongfully accused. Yet, there is no acknowledgment of potential injustice in his case, nor is there any criticism of the government’s actions. This is another concerning aspect of the situation.

If the Church cannot speak the full truth, it would be better to remain silent rather than produce a show that comes across as hypocritical to viewers. The lack of nuance and compassion in such portrayals undermines the Church’s moral authority and risks alienating those who seek truth and justice.

This is the situation as it stands. The position taken by the Church is understandable and, in some ways, reasonable. We can agree that they are expected to say the things they are saying. However, this does not necessarily reflect the full truth. People want to hear the truth from the Church, not just assurances that everything is fine and good. This is the issue with the Church channel and its approach.

Another point discussed on the channel was the speech by Maria Shukchina, who received a medal from the government, presented by the prime minister. In her acceptance speech, she heavily criticized the state of culture in Russia, stating that it is dead, neglected, and that the government is doing nothing to address it. She lamented the lack of heroes in modern society, pointing out that even when heroes do exist, they are often dismissed or labeled as crazy or bad. While she did not mention Romanov by name, it was clear she was referring to him, as she had been a vocal supporter of his during the events of last year.

What does this tell us? It highlights a gap in the Church’s public voice. The Church has priests and bishops who work tirelessly, like an army, fighting against evil on a daily basis. They focus on individual spiritual battles, combating the devil in the lives of the people they serve. This work has a profoundly positive influence on society and the people of God. However, these priests and bishops are not typically the ones who step onto high platforms, appear on TV talk shows, or publicly criticize the systemic evils in government or Church leadership. They are not empowered to do so, nor do they dare to, because doing so could jeopardize their daily work. This is not because they are cowardly, thoughtless, or indifferent—many of them understand the issues deeply—but because it is not their role or position to engage in such public critiques. There is nothing inherently wrong with this.

However, this creates a void. There is a lack of a strong Church voice at the higher levels, addressing the systemic evils in society and the world. This is why people like Maria Shukchina, especially those in the elite, do not hear the Church speaking out on these issues. They seek individuals who care deeply and are willing to speak truthfully, which is why Shukchina found herself drawn to Romanov. She supported him not for his sectarian ideas or questionable practices like exorcisms, but for his courage to speak freely and openly about truths that others would not dare to address. She admired his independence from the system and his willingness to challenge the status quo.

People like Shukchina are rare. As a layperson without theological training, her approach may be clumsy or imperfect when discussing matters of faith and the Church. Yet, she carries a deep pain for the injustices she sees and desires to confront evil at a systemic level. We need to understand this and offer support to individuals like her. Perhaps we can guide them to avoid major errors or mistakes, but we should not dismiss them outright. 

The Church channel, however, takes a different stance. If Romanov is portrayed as a bad actor, then anyone who supports him is also labeled as foolish, misguided, or problematic. This black-and-white approach is unfortunate and lacks nuance. It fails to recognize the genuine concerns and motivations of those who align with figures like Romanov.

In conclusion, we must understand the broader context. The Church is alive and engaged in a spiritual battle against evil. Its priests and bishops work diligently on the ground, fighting for the souls of individuals. However, there is a need for a stronger, more courageous voice at the higher levels to address systemic injustices and speak truth to power. This is where figures like Maria Shukchina and, to some extent, Romanov, step in. While their methods may be imperfect, their desire to confront evil and seek justice should not be dismissed. The Church must find a way to bridge this gap, offering both spiritual guidance and a prophetic voice that resonates with those who seek truth and justice in a complex world.

Indeed, the situation is highly complex, and the devil seeks to exploit this complexity to sow division, provoke quarrels, and lead people into wrongdoing. In such times, we must strive for wisdom and approach everyone with love, seeking to understand their actions and words rather than rushing to judgment. It is important to recognize the goodness in people and not assume evil intentions at every turn.

Let us pray for this entire situation, asking the Lord to strengthen our faith. Often, problems arise from a lack of faith or trust in God. By deepening our reliance on Him, we gain the wisdom and strength needed to overcome all challenges, both visible and invisible. Through faith, we find victory over the forces that seek to divide and destroy.

May God bless us all and guide us through these difficult times. Amen.
