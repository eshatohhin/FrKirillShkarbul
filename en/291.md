# Why the Baptism of Christ makes us Children of God

Dear brothers and sisters, on January 19th, the Holy Church celebrates the Epiphany, or the Baptism, of the Lord.  
We begin this celebration on January 18th, and it continues until January 27th—spanning 10 days.  
Why is this so important? In the early Church, Epiphany was more significant than Christmas.  
It originally encompassed Christmas within itself, and only later were the two feasts separated.  
Even now, one flows into the other. You see, we celebrate Christmas all the way until January 17th,  
and on the 18th, the very next day, we begin celebrating Epiphany. What unites these two feasts?  
And how is the baptism of Christ related to us? Why is it significant? Why was it so important in the early Church?  
Let us address these questions one by one, so that we may gain a deep understanding and appreciation of this great celebration,  
this profound event, and its significance.  

First, let us read how this event unfolded.  
We turn to Matthew 3:13-15:  
"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.  
But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?  
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.  
Then he suffered him."  

Here, "suffered" means "allowed," correct? So, to fulfill all righteousness, or to complete,  
to accomplish all truth, all righteousness. What does this mean? What righteousness?  
This is very important, brothers and sisters. We see our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,  
coming to receive baptism from a man, John the Baptist. There is a tension here,  
which is why John himself hesitated, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and yet You come to me?"  

So, what is this righteousness? Righteousness is alignment with the law of God.  
When you are in line with the law of God, you are righteous.  
The Lord Himself was sinless. He fulfilled every commandment.  
He completed and satisfied every requirement of the law, and now He seeks to be verified.  
The baptism of John was a method of demonstrating that a person had turned from sin  
and now stood on the path of righteousness. It was a public declaration of repentance and alignment with God's will.  

But here lies the mystery: the Lord had no sins to repent of. He was already perfectly righteous.  
Yet, He underwent baptism to fulfill all righteousness—to fully identify with humanity  
and to sanctify the waters of baptism for our sake. Through His baptism in the Jordan,  
He not only affirmed His sinlessness but also inaugurated a new path of grace for us.  

I hope this clarifies the profound significance of this event. Let us reflect on this great mystery  
and draw closer to the Lord, who humbled Himself for our salvation.

So, this act of baptism can be seen as the final commandment that Jesus had to fulfill to demonstrate the validity of this baptism. This was the truth—accomplishing all righteousness had to be sealed by undergoing the rite of baptism in the Jordan by John. By doing this, He not only fulfilled the requirement but also blessed and approved what John was doing. In other words, Jesus affirmed that John was not a false prophet or a sectarian heretic. The Lord essentially said, "I approve of John's ministry." This is the second reason for His baptism.  

Additionally, by being baptized, Jesus established that the path to knowing the Messiah requires repentance through John the Baptist. When questioned about His identity as the Messiah, Jesus responded by asking about John the Baptist: "Was John's authority from heaven or from men?" When they refused to answer, He said, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I am doing these things." This exchange highlights that recognizing John as a true prophet of God and repenting through his baptism were prerequisites for understanding and following the Messiah. Repentance is the only way to Christ—there is no shortcut or alternative. It requires turning away from sin, repenting, and committing to follow God.  

The third significant aspect of Jesus' baptism is this: while people normally come to baptism to be washed and sanctified, in Jesus' case, He was baptized to sanctify the waters for all of humanity. He blessed the waters and established the sacrament of baptism for the Church. By being baptized Himself, He sanctified the act of baptism for all who would follow. This is why baptism is a sacrament—a sacred means of grace.  

Moreover, during His baptism, we see the Holy Spirit descending upon Him. This signifies that everyone who is baptized in the future will also receive the Holy Spirit. This is of immense importance, brothers and sisters. Many Protestants and other groups reject the sacramental nature of baptism, but the Lord Himself said, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." The Holy Spirit is given to us in baptism, and this is how we are reborn spiritually.  

John the Baptist prophesied this when he said, "I baptize you with water, but He who comes after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire." This prophecy is fulfilled in Jesus' baptism, where we see the Holy Spirit descending. Thus, Jesus' baptism is not only for Himself but for us. Through His baptism, He sanctified the waters, established the sacrament, and opened the way for us to receive the Holy Spirit. This is why His baptism is of such great significance.

This is indeed a profound paradox. Let us explore the fourth point: John initially resists baptizing Jesus, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and yet You come to me?" By doing this, John publicly acknowledges that Jesus does not need repentance because He is sinless. This public declaration by John, a recognized prophet, serves as a confirmation that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. This moment marks the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, as we read in John 1:31: "I myself did not know Him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that He might be revealed to Israel." Thus, Jesus' baptism is not only a personal act but also a public revelation of His identity and mission.  

Now, let us turn to the fifth and final point, which ties everything together. In the Old Testament, to become a priest, one had to be at least 30 years old—a sign of maturity. Before assuming the priestly role, the individual had to undergo a ritual cleansing, a baptism of sorts, to prepare for service to God. Similarly, before offering sacrifices, priests had to cleanse themselves in the *mikveh* (a ritual bath), and even the sacrificial animals had to be washed.  

At the age of 30, Jesus, having fully experienced human life—childhood, youth, and adulthood—is now ready to fulfill His mission. Through His baptism, He symbolically takes on the role of both priest and sacrifice. He becomes the High Priest who offers Himself as the perfect Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of the world. His baptism is a pivotal moment where He steps into this dual role, sanctifying the waters and inaugurating His ministry of redemption.  

This brings us back to the connection between His birth, baptism, and death. His birth was an act of profound humility—God becoming man, limited by human frailty. His baptism is another act of humility, as He submits to the law and fulfills all righteousness. The voice from heaven declares, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," affirming His perfect obedience to the Father's will.  

Finally, His baptism is directly linked to His death. The ultimate act of humility is displayed on the cross, where He suffers and dies for our salvation. As St. Paul explains, we are baptized into His death (Romans 6:3-4). Through baptism, we participate in His death and resurrection, dying to sin and rising to new life in Him.  

Thus, the baptism of the Lord is a moment of profound significance—it reveals His identity, inaugurates His ministry, sanctifies the waters for our baptism, and foreshadows His sacrificial death. It is a bridge between His humble birth and His redemptive death, uniting the mysteries of His life and mission. Let us reflect deeply on this great mystery and draw closer to the Lord, who humbled Himself for our sake.

Indeed, we see that the birth, baptism, and death of Christ are intricately connected, forming a unified mystery of salvation. These events are not isolated but are deeply interwoven, and they are directly linked to our own baptism. In our baptism, the power of Christ's passion, His cross, and His resurrection are at work, making us dead to sin, to the flesh, and to the world, while simultaneously making us alive to Christ and the Kingdom of Heaven. This transformation is accomplished and manifested in the sacrament of baptism.  

This is why the feast is called Epiphany—it is a revelation, not only of the Holy Trinity but also of the great project of Christ's salvation. At His baptism, the heavens are torn open, and the Holy Trinity is revealed: the voice of the Father is heard, declaring, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"; the Son is being baptized in the Jordan; and the Holy Spirit descends like a dove. This manifestation of the Trinity is a profound moment of revelation, witnessed by John the Baptist and likely others, as recorded in Scripture.  

Brothers and sisters, let us reflect deeply on these truths. Our baptism is essential to our salvation. It is not merely a symbolic act but a participation in the death and resurrection of Christ. Through baptism, we are born anew for the Kingdom of Heaven, and our entire spiritual life is a continuation of this baptismal grace.  

The Lord also uses powerful symbols to teach us about the meaning of baptism. In Matthew 3:12, we read: "His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." Baptism, like the winnowing fan, separates what is holy from what is unholy. It purifies us, burning away what is irrelevant and sinful, leaving only what is precious and eternal.  

Similarly, the imagery of the axe and the sword is tied to baptism. The axe cuts away the corrupted and unrepentant parts of our souls, while the sword of God's Word divides truth from falsehood, good from evil. These symbols remind us that baptism is not only a moment of grace but also a call to ongoing repentance and transformation.  

I also want to emphasize one more point about the righteousness of Christ. Why did He need to be baptized? Because He took upon Himself the entirety of humanity, which, after Adam, was under the curse of sin. To remove this curse, He had to participate fully in our humanity, even undergoing baptism. By fulfilling the law through His life, ministry, and obedience, He broke the curse and became the one who is fully pleasing to God. Through His baptism, He opened the way for all of us to be liberated from sin and death, inviting us into the Kingdom of Heaven, which was revealed when the heavens were torn open.  

This is the life to which the Lord calls us—a life of holiness, repentance, and union with Him. Let us embrace the grace of our baptism and live as children of the Kingdom, ever mindful of the great mystery of Christ's birth, baptism, and death, which have brought us salvation.

Amen. May we indeed be children of this divine life, dear brothers and sisters. Let us pray that during these holy days of Epiphany, we may become worthy children of our heavenly Father. May our actions, thoughts, and words be pleasing to God, and may Jesus Christ truly live in us, being born anew in our hearts. This is the fulfillment of what He brought into the world through His Nativity, His Christmas.  

I hope, brothers and sisters, that you now see the profound connection between the Nativity, the Baptism, the death, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. These mysteries are not separate but are deeply intertwined, revealing the fullness of God's plan for our salvation.  

Christmas is often called the "winter Pascha," highlighting its deep relationship with the Paschal mystery—the death and resurrection of Christ. Let us rejoice during these days, allowing ourselves to be washed and cleansed, renewing the grace of our baptism through confession and the reception of the Holy Eucharist.  

May the Lord keep us in His holiness and guide us to live as true children of the light. A blessed and merry Epiphany to all of you, brothers and sisters. May the Lord's blessing be upon each of you, now and always. Amen.
