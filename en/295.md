# We are in GOLEM. How to get out

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord has called us to be vigilant. To be spiritually vigilant means, first and foremost, to embrace repentance—to examine ourselves, to be watchful over our own souls, and to recognize how far we may have strayed from God. We must acknowledge our unworthiness. This is the first step. We must also be vigilant about His will, attentive to what He is revealing to us today, and mindful of how He is guiding us. Additionally, we must be alert to the dangers that surround us, ready at any moment to counteract and block any threat, ensuring we do not fall into error or enslavement.

To achieve this, we as Christians must understand the deceptions orchestrated by the devil. When I speak of topics such as the beast, enslavement, or elements from the apocalypse, it is not out of fear, phobia, or paranoia—unlike those who see the Antichrist in every shadow. No, we are not afraid of such things. Rather, we seek a deeper understanding and preparation for any threats that may arise. In fact, we aim to free ourselves from traps we may already have fallen into. Today, I wish to discuss one such trap—a significant one—that many of us are already ensnared in. To achieve spiritual freedom, we must recognize this trap and seek the Lord's help to escape it.

What is this trap? I describe it as a "golem," a creation that grows increasingly destructive. What is a golem? You may have heard of the Jewish medieval legend about a rabbi who fashioned a creature from dust—an artificial man—to assist him in his tasks. While this is merely a legend, the concept of creating a homunculus, or an artificial being to serve one's purposes, has persisted throughout history, even among alchemists and occultists. Though it may seem strange, it is, in fact, a logical pursuit for those driven by power and control.

The primary goal of secret societies, occultists, Kabbalists, and others consumed by the maniacal desire to dominate the world—those who serve as instruments of the devil's plan and embody the spirit of the Antichrist—is to create golems. These golems, in the past, manifested in wars where nations were brainwashed into fighting one another. In other instances, they took the form of heresies, often crafted by Kabbalists and Gnostics to undermine the Church. Even the structure of Roman Catholicism, with its rigid hierarchy and bureaucratic mechanisms, can be seen as a successful "golem" project of the devil—a counterfeit church designed to control and manipulate.

These creations are not random; they share a common nature. Why create an artificial being? Consider this: if you are consumed by sin—say, a lust for power—you would want others to carry out your dirty work. A gangster, for example, would not do the deed himself but would command others to act on his behalf. Similarly, if you seek to expand your empire or fulfill carnal desires, you would desire obedient followers who blindly execute your will. This is the essence of slavery—total subjugation to another's desires.

Both capitalist and socialist systems are rooted in this principle of control and exploitation. The spirit of creating golems—artificial entities or systems that serve the ambitions of the powerful—pervades human history. As Christians, we must remain vigilant, recognizing these traps and seeking the Lord's guidance to free ourselves from them. Only through His grace can we overcome the deceptions of the devil and achieve true spiritual freedom.

To achieve control over others, you need mechanisms to make people do what you desire. This is where the power of money, science, and technology comes into play. These tools are wielded to manipulate and dominate. At the heart of this lies an idea rooted in the devil's ambition to be like God. God created humanity in His image and likeness, but the devil seeks to create a distorted version of humanity—a new mankind fashioned in his own image and likeness. This is the essence of the transhumanist vision, where humanity is reshaped and enslaved, willingly embracing its own subjugation.

This concept of making people "love their slavery" was famously articulated by Aldous Huxley in his 1962 lecture at Berkeley. It represents the ultimate revolution: not merely forcing people into submission, but convincing them to desire and cherish their chains. Throughout history, those driven by this spirit of control have achieved significant success. Their efforts bore fruit particularly after the Renaissance, as Christian nations drifted into apostasy, abandoning God. The creation of modernity, symbolized by the Leviathan—a political and social construct—marked the beginning of this shift. The Industrial Revolution further entrenched this system, binding people to machines and giving rise to the automaton—a society of mechanized, dehumanized individuals.

This evolution culminated in the birth of mass society, where entire nations or even humanity could be molded to think alike. This was achieved through media, education, and the propagation of "common sense" or widely accepted values. In the 19th century, Western Europe saw the realization of this vision, where individuals were expected to conform to ideologies like Darwinism or risk being marginalized as outsiders—conspiracy theorists or fringe thinkers. This mass society was built on the idea of a new religion, where nationhood, blood, and ethnicity were elevated to sacred status. This ideology fueled the First World War, as nations destroyed one another in the name of these false idols.

The aftermath of the war demolished much of what remained of the Christian past, paving the way for even larger "golems" in the 20th century. The bipolar world of the Cold War era, with its two dominant narratives, represented these colossal golems. Today, there is an effort to consolidate these into a single, unified golem, with smaller factions like conservatives and liberals serving as minor golems within the larger framework. The ultimate goal is one overarching narrative, achieved through media, moral degradation, and other tools of manipulation. Media, in particular, has become the primary instrument of control, encompassing social networks, chats, and platforms like YouTube. The more dependent we become on these tools, the more we are drawn into the narrative of the golem, often without realizing it, becoming objects of manipulation.

This grand plan, spanning centuries, may seem impossible for any group of individuals, even secret societies like the so-called "Committee of 300." However, behind this lies a spiritual force—the spirit of the Devil, the spirit of the Antichrist. The individuals who carry out this plan—figures like Lenin, Trotsky, the Rothschilds, Marx, and Hegel—come and go, often quickly. They are mere instruments of a deeper, more malevolent will. Their actions are part of a larger, spiritual battle, one that we as Christians must recognize and resist through vigilance, repentance, and reliance on the Lord. Only by understanding this can we hope to free ourselves from the traps of the golem and reclaim our spiritual freedom.

The list of individuals who have contributed directly to this grand plan is endless, and most of them have long since passed away. Many met painful ends, as the Lord foretold, likening their fate to ash blown away by the wind. Yet, while these individuals are gone, the larger plan continues to unfold. Today, we live in a world where technocrats are attempting to construct a global panopticon—a system of total surveillance and control—rising from the ashes of the chaos and destruction they themselves have orchestrated. This is yet another attempt by the spirit of the Antichrist to dominate humanity.

We must think spiritually to understand this. The spirit of the Antichrist is like a giant, periodically awakening to attempt control over the world. Whether through figures like Lenin, Hitler, or others, this spirit manifests in different forms, testing new strategies to achieve its goal. Each attempt may fail, but the underlying idea remains the same. Over time, these cycles bring both lessons for the Church and a gradual descent for humanity toward the precipice of destruction. We can see this progression across generations.

Take, for example, the modern technocrat Elon Musk. His grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a technocrat who admired apartheid, Nazism, and fascism—ideologies centered on the idea of a select few controlling society without democracy, justified by their supposed superior knowledge and technological prowess. Haldeman envisioned a world running like a factory, a dehumanized system of control. In the 1950s and 1960s, his ideas were rejected, and he was sued and expelled from Canada. Yet, decades later, his grandson, Elon Musk, pursues similar ambitions, leveraging modern technology and circumstances to implement a comparable vision. This pattern reveals the persistence of the spirit behind these plans, adapting to new eras and tools.

While figures like Musk may fail in their attempts, we, as Christians, must remain vigilant and informed. Understanding the source of these dangers empowers us to resist them. We should not succumb to fear or phobia but instead focus on spiritual strength and discernment. Our primary agenda must always be spiritual, transcending family, political, or technological concerns. We must strive for spiritual freedom, breaking free from addictions and dependencies, including those on social media.

Social media, while seemingly an extension of human abilities, is a tool of entrapment. It promises greater influence and power but at the cost of our souls. This is part of the broader "gamification of reality," where values, behaviors, and even language are increasingly shaped by these platforms. The new, Orwellian language they create further entrenches their control over thought and behavior.

As brothers and sisters in Christ, we must recognize these dangers and guard our hearts and minds. By staying rooted in our spiritual agenda, we can resist the traps of the golem and remain free in Christ. Let us not be deceived by the allure of technology or the false promises of control. Instead, let us focus on the eternal truths of the Gospel, ensuring that our lives reflect the freedom and light of Christ in a world increasingly dominated by darkness.

The monks, living in the desert, have demonstrated for centuries that it is possible to be close to God without the distractions of modern technology. They thrived without the internet, social media, or any of the so-called "extensions" of human ability that we rely on today. In fact, they often lived in greater spiritual freedom and fulfillment than many of us do now, despite all our technological advancements. Their example reminds us that true connection with God does not depend on gadgets or devices but on a heart and mind focused on Him.

Let us strive to free ourselves from any dependency or influence that comes through these modern tools. We must guard against the subtle brainwashing that can occur through constant exposure to social media, apps, and other digital platforms. Instead, let us prioritize our spiritual lives, ensuring that our ministry to the Lord and our witness of His love remain at the center of our existence.

A critical question we must ask ourselves is: Where is the boundary? When we use technology, are we truly in control, or is it controlling us? This distinction is vital but often difficult to discern. It is easy to deceive ourselves into thinking we are using technology for good, while in reality, it may be shaping our thoughts, behaviors, and priorities in ways that pull us away from God. We must remain vigilant, constantly evaluating whether we are using these tools as instruments for God's work or allowing them to use us as instruments of the world.

May the Lord protect us from slipping into this trap. May He guide us to use technology wisely, setting boundaries that keep us free from its enslaving grip. Let us not become puppets or slaves of the golem that the spirit of the Antichrist is building. Instead, may we remain steadfast in our faith, rooted in the divine kingdom, and focused on serving our Lord with pure hearts and minds.

God bless you, brothers and sisters. May we walk in spiritual freedom, ever mindful of the dangers around us, and ever faithful to the call of Christ. Amen.
