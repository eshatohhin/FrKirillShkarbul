# Why evil gets worse Is catastrophe coming Should we avoid news

Dear Brothers and Sisters, we see how much evil there is in this world, and even more is coming. The world is facing a significant global crisis, and it can happen very suddenly—maybe next year. We don't know exactly when, but it's going to be much worse than what we have experienced, including the sickness, the war, and everything else.

Of course, to talk about evil in this world, first of all, we need to recognize the evil within ourselves. We need to repent and refrain from blaming others. The whole world is corrupt—society is corrupt, politics are corrupt, governments are corrupt—everything is in a dire state. But let us not think, "I am the best." No. If we want to discuss these issues, first and foremost, we need to repent deeply and acknowledge that we ourselves are part of the reason why all these things are happening. Me. This is how we should feel. It is because I have not done what the Lord has called me to do. I did not become a great saint who could inspire everyone and accomplish great things so that the world could be different. I did not do all of those things. Every one of us is guilty.

Moreover, when we see these things happening, we should recognize that it is the work of the devil, who is behind it all, not merely the individuals who become his servants, blinded or inspired by him.

So today, I want to speak about why this evil is approaching and growing worse, and why it will eventually lead to the rise of the Antichrist at some point. Why is this happening? Essentially, this is happening not because evil is becoming stronger, but because goodness and righteousness are becoming less and less prevalent, weaker and weaker.

For example, consider a perverted individual, someone with a truly ugly mind—a pedophile or the like. When such a person does something evil, of course, they operate in darkness, where no one can see. But if they step out into the street or a public place, they will dress properly and behave appropriately, especially if they are in a setting where they are expected to be polite, kind, and presentable. They will conform to these expectations, but this does not mean that this is who they truly are.

This is what the Apostle Paul speaks of regarding the mystery of lawlessness. This mystery arises from its ability to disguise itself. Those who propose and push this agenda have had their plans in place for a long time and are eager to implement them as soon as possible. However, they are afraid that people will not accept or embrace their ideas. They fear that people will say, "No, we don't want this." So, they live in constant fear and frustration, unable to carry out their desires. These individuals are deeply miserable, suffering every day from this internal conflict. It is a form of torture imposed by the devil to be in such a role. You would never want to be in their position, no matter how much money or power they possess. It is a wretched existence, and ultimately, it leads to eternal condemnation, for they become enemies of Christ, enemies of Truth.

Wherever Christ is present, there is Truth, righteousness, the Kingdom of Heaven, and victory over every evil and every demon. This is crucial: if we live with Christ, if we are filled with righteousness, everything around us will change, and it will become much more difficult for evil to accomplish its goals.

Consider, for example, going to church. You attend, pray for a few hours, repent of your sins, and listen to the Holy Gospel. If this experience is genuine—if it is not mere hypocrisy—and if you truly pray and leave the church, you will be far less likely to engage in sinful or harmful behavior immediately afterward.

Perhaps after some time, our corrupt nature resurfaces, and we find ourselves grappling with despondency, greed, anger, lust, accusations, arrogance, and all manner of sinful tendencies. These things may not manifest immediately, but they emerge as we drift away from Christ and lose the Spirit of God, allowing evil to creep back into our hearts. This reminds us that only through Christ can we conquer all forms of evil.

With this in mind, we must consider what lies ahead and how to prepare ourselves. People today are bombarded with news—each story worse than the last. There are reports of economic crises, wars, potential famine, and countless other problems looming on the horizon. Many, upon hearing such news daily, feel overwhelmed and think, "I’m tired of this. I don’t want to be part of it anymore. I’ll just focus on my own life, my own projects, and be done with it all." But is this the right choice?

The answer depends on your motivation. Your choice may be right or wrong based on the underlying reason for your decision. How can we discern our motivation? We can tell by examining what we intend to do. If you withdraw from the world, what will you focus on? Will you simply concentrate on your personal life, hobbies, vacations, and living peacefully without engaging with others? If this is your plan, it is an act of escape—an attempt to avoid facing reality and the evil in the world, refusing to fight against it. This is not the right path, as it leads to spiritual slumber. We become like the walking dead, like zombies, fleeing from painful realities that will still unfold. Whether it’s war, digital control, or other changes, these things will happen, and by avoiding them, you will ultimately embrace them and become enslaved. This is the wrong choice.

The right motivation for withdrawing from the world is to enter into a deeper spiritual life—to embrace asceticism, join a monastery, pray, read the Gospels, study theology, and focus on prayer, fasting, and pursuing Jesus Christ. If this is your goal, then withdrawing from worldly distractions can be beneficial. It allows you to focus entirely on pursuing God, who will reveal everything you need to know and do, ensuring you do not fall into spiritual sleep. This is a special calling.

Of course, some are called to remain in the world and fight against its evils—to bear witness to the truth, oppose the devil’s schemes, and fulfill their mission in that way. This is another calling, another mission. Regardless of your specific calling, the goal must always be to become a soldier of Christ. It should never be about simply running away, burying your head in the sand, and pretending the world’s problems don’t exist.

What could happen in the future? It’s possible that the world could be shut down, and people might be told that the only way to survive is to adopt electronic currency. There may be no other choice—everyone would be required to use it. This could lead to total control: monitoring every transaction, implementing social ratings, and other forms of surveillance. This would be part of the new world order, a more advanced and pervasive version of control. I believe this shift will not happen gradually but rather as a sudden, large-scale event. Right now, preparations are being made—people are being conditioned, and systems are being put in place to ensure this can be implemented globally and simultaneously. They will convince everyone that this is the only solution to our problems. Whether you are in Russia and told that adopting this system is necessary to win the war, or in another country and told it is the only way to overcome the economic crisis, the message will be the same: this is the only way forward.

And everyone will believe it, and everyone will happily accept it. The world will slip into this new form of slavery. So, what should we do? This is the critical question. What can we do about it? We must be spiritually strong. We need to recognize that this is a lie, should it come to pass. But at some point, it will happen. We must be prepared to make sacrifices—perhaps our careers, our property, or other worldly possessions.

Even as I speak to you now, there is an earthquake. You can see everything shaking. At this very moment, the ground trembles. But no matter how great the earthquake or the challenges that come, we must stand firm in Christ, rooted in His righteousness. May the Lord be with us, granting us His blessing. May He strengthen us in our spiritual lives, cleanse our hearts of all impurities and evil, and help us remain loyal to Him until the end, no matter what trials we face.

May it be so. God bless.
