# How to measure true success

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about the results of our lives, the fruits of our lives.  
Because sometimes, when we believe in God, we don’t fully understand how our values and goals should change.  
Very often, people believe in Christ, yet their lives remain exactly the same as they were before.  
They have the same goals, the same way of life, and pretty much everything stays unchanged.  
Perhaps there are a few extras—sometimes they go to church, sometimes they do something—but overall, it’s all the same.  
This is a significant risk that we must avoid.  

We see that humans need some kind of goal and a way to measure the results of their work and their lives.  
Are they reaching these goals? Are they meeting these aims? Do they have any achievements?  
We were talking about successful people versus unsuccessful people.  
So, what is the standard of success that we, as Christians, need to be aware of and constantly evaluate?  
Do I have any progress? Do I have any fruits in my life that the Lord expects from me?  

We see that for an economy or a country, growth is essential. GDP must grow, production volumes must increase, and assets must expand.  
These are the goals of an economy, as it is understood.  
For a company, it’s the same. They need profit, expanded operations, new markets—they need growth.  
For individuals, it’s often about money, savings, salary increases, career advancement, and an improved quality of life.  
They want better things—a better house, a better car. This is the product of their lives.  
This is what they dedicate themselves to. This is what they strive to accumulate as a result of their daily efforts.  

Yet, all these things are largely irrelevant to Christ.  
He said that when the Son of Man returns to earth—referring to the time of the Second Coming—will He find any faith on earth?  
This exclamation from our Lord tells us that there will be very little faith, very little indeed.  
And what is faith? Faith is not merely belief in something.  
Belief in Christ, belief in aliens—that’s not faith. Faith is something that changes our hearts, our lives, and our minds.  
Faith must bring transformation. If it doesn’t, it’s not faith.  
If it’s just a belief that something is true, then it’s nothing.  
What’s important is that faith, like a seed, brings change.  

The Lord will look at the society of that time and ask, “Is this society any different from one where there is no Bible, no commandments, no knowledge of Christ or the church? Would it be the same?”  
Are people living just as they would if He had not come and they knew nothing about Him?  
If that’s the case, then there is no faith. There are no fruits of faith.  
This is the situation we find ourselves in right now.  

We are in a spiritual desert because people are preoccupied with everything but faith.  
They can talk about anything—food, music, whatever—but few think or speak about faith.  
This is because they want to live as though there is no God, no Christ, no commandments.  
They just live. They just have fun. They eat, drink, and carry on as if nothing else matters.  

This is the greatest risk and the greatest temptation we face.  
The results and products of our efforts must be tied to faith—to increasing faith.  
The measure by which faith grows is the outcome, the GDP, the profit, the income that will matter to God.  
This is what He will value when He looks at us each day and when we stand before Him after death.  
This is what He will examine and care about.  

So, let’s talk more practically, because very often, people believe in Christ but don’t understand this.

They think, "Okay, we’ll just build more churches or do some other projects."  
But we need to ask: Is this project related to increasing faith—strengthening it in ourselves and in others?  
So, let’s consider the two basic conditions that enable us to bear more fruit.  

The first is studying the Gospel and the lives of the saints—those who are now in heaven and whose lives led them there.  
Not through their own efforts, but through how the Lord worked in their lives,  
how they were able to serve Him and build a relationship with Him that allowed them to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  
By studying their lives, we can see concrete examples that help us better understand the Gospel and what it calls us to become.  

The second essential condition is our participation in church life.  
We are not saved individually; we are saved within the Church.  
We are parts of the Body of Christ, and our involvement in church life—through the Divine Liturgy, the holy sacraments, and communal worship—is an absolute requirement.  
This is how we gain the spiritual strength needed to bear fruit in terms of increasing faith in our lives.  

Now, let’s look at the specific fruits of faith.  
First, prayer and fasting are essential.  
Prayer requires us to dedicate time and sometimes even force ourselves to engage in it.  
This is a real fruit that the Lord looks for—evidence that our faith is producing something tangible.  
Fasting, on the other hand, involves limiting our passions and desires, submitting our bodies and minds to Christ.  
It’s a way of disciplining ourselves to become better and stronger in serving Him, especially during fasting periods.  

The third fruit is how we approach our main occupation—our job, studies, or whatever fills our daily lives.  
This must become a place where we live out our faith.  
Whether we’re serving people, cleaning, or creating a product, we need to see that we are serving Christ through our work.  
It’s not just about making money, advancing our careers, or gaining status—it’s about ministry and service to Christ.  
This mindset should shape the content of our lives.  

The fourth area is our communication with others.  
How do we interact with people? Do we talk about everything except Christ?  
If our conversations revolve solely around food, travel, shopping, or politics, something is wrong with our faith.  
Our primary interest should be Christ and faith.  
This doesn’t mean we become fanatics who refuse to discuss anything else, but Christ should be our main priority.  
If He is truly in our hearts, many of our conversations will naturally turn to Him and faith.  
This is what the Lord desires from us, and it can inspire others to shift their focus from worldly matters to Christ and His teachings.  

Finally, self-education about faith is crucial.  
We need to be eager to learn more—to read about theology, church history, and Christian morals.  
There’s so much to explore, and we should continually feed ourselves with knowledge that deepens our faith.  
However, the most important source of knowledge is the Gospel itself.  
It’s not optional; it must be central to our lives.  
We need to draw all our understanding, revelation, and answers from the Gospel—from what Christ has said and done.  

These are the ways we can bear fruit in our faith and live lives that truly honor God.

And of course, our hobbies—what we do in our free time when we relax—should also reflect our faith.  
Whether it’s collecting something, gardening, or any other activity, it’s better if it’s somehow connected to Christ, to God, or to faith.  
This will make it more meaningful and aligned with our spiritual journey.  

So, let us reflect on this and strive to bear more fruit for Christ every day.  
Let us be grateful that He gives us countless opportunities to grow and serve Him.  
Each day that comes is a new chance to move forward, to go somewhere, to do something meaningful.  

The biggest risk we face today, especially with the challenges of the pandemic, is that many people feel lost.  
They don’t understand where they’re going, what they’re doing, or what the future holds.  
This uncertainty can drive people to despair or confusion.  
But we must always remember that we are moving in a clear direction—toward Christ.  
Every day, we are becoming stronger and drawing closer to Him.  

May the Lord help us on this path.  
May He give us hearts that are eager to increase these fruits of faith—to grow it, strengthen it, and share it with others.  
May He bless us and guide us as we strive to live lives that honor Him and bear witness to His love and truth.  
Amen.
