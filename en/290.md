# 7 Churches of the Apocalypse, and which one are we in now

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share with you not the official Church teaching, but some thoughts and reflections on the Book of Revelation. It is perfectly acceptable to have unique insights or personal applications of the Holy Scripture to your own life or to the current state of the world. Although this is my interpretation of certain parts of Revelation, it is not based solely on my subjective feelings or ideas. The methods and concepts I will be using have been employed by other thinkers, researchers, and theologians—particularly Orthodox theologians—who have deeply studied and explored various interpretations and applications of Revelation. This is all part of a rich and longstanding tradition.

However, these particular insights or applications are not official teachings. You are free to take from them whatever you find useful. You do not have to accept them as absolute truth, because Revelation was written in such a way that each individual, according to their own experience and spiritual life, can uncover as much as they are meant to at any given time—no more, no less. Therefore, please do not take what I will be saying too critically. These are simply ideas to ponder and reflect upon. If we can find something useful in them, then I believe they have served their purpose.

To help you understand what I will be discussing, I first want to introduce the idea of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation, chapters 2 and 3. These seven churches can be interpreted as representing seven periods in Church history. Of course, they could also symbolize different degrees or situations within the same church during the same period, or different churches coexisting in the same era. Your own parish might even resonate more closely with one of these churches. Essentially, there are seven archetypes, and while this framework may not be perfect, it works quite well when applied to the broader scope of Church history. Even if this interpretation is not entirely accurate, it is still worth considering.

According to this reading, I will not delve into every period in detail, as that would take many hours. Instead, I will share my perspective that we are currently at the end of the sixth period and transitioning into the seventh period—the Laodicean period. The sixth period is the Philadelphian, and the seventh is the Laodicean, which is not a favorable period. The Philadelphian period was spiritually stronger than the Laodicean period. However, this does not mean that everything in the Church will be bad during this time. The predominant paradigm of any given period does not determine everything or everyone. The Holy Spirit has been guiding the Church since the Lord ascended and sent His disciples, who received the Holy Spirit, and He will continue to guide the Church until the end of the world. When the Lord criticizes the Church, it is out of love, as He desires her to grow and change. And when someone falls away, they are no longer part of the Church.

Here, we are specifically discussing the Orthodox Church, which we believe to be the true Church of Christ. We reject the adulterous spirit of ecumenism and recognize that, unfortunately, members of other groups who call themselves Christian—heretical groups—do not possess the grace of the Lord. They have fallen away, and we hope they will return.

Now, let us briefly discuss the sixth period, the Philadelphian. The Philadelphian Church is externally weak and limited in its capacity to act, but spiritually it is very strong. This period of weakness followed the fall of the Orthodox empires and the rise of secularism and post-Christianity in the world. As a result, Orthodox Christians today come to the Church only if they are truly motivated. It is a free choice.

It is not merely due to cultural tradition or certain privileges that people come to the Church. That was characteristic of the earlier period, represented by the Church of Sardis, and some remnants of that mindset still remain. However, after the revolutions, the rise of secularism, and other societal shifts, those who attend church every Sunday today do so because they genuinely understand what they are doing—not out of habit or external pressures. While their numbers may be few, they possess great spiritual charisma, and many will be drawn to and converted into the Church, including Jews—not all, but those who are earnestly seeking the truth. During the Philadelphian period, the true Israel—not the "synagogue of Satan," which will persist until the end—but those Jews who sincerely seek the truth, will enter the Church of Christ. This has been unfolding throughout the 20th century and continues today. However, that is a topic for another time.

Now, let us turn our attention to what is coming with the Laodicean Church. This transition does not happen overnight. Just as it is impossible to pinpoint an exact date for the end of the Middle Ages or the beginning of modernity or postmodernism in secular history, we cannot identify a precise moment when the Church moved from one period to the next. Nevertheless, in my view, we are currently in the midst of this transition. You may have different thoughts on this, but this is my perspective.

So, what does the Laodicean Church represent? Let us turn directly to the Book of Revelation, chapter 3, verses 14 to 22, and I will provide commentary as I read:

*"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth."*

This is a stern rebuke to the Church. What does it mean? While it carries many layers of meaning, at its core, it reflects a spirit of indifference. The attitude is: *"As long as things are running smoothly—we have services, funding, and support from donors, the government, or whoever—we don’t care about anything else."* When injustice arises, we remain silent. When harmful trends like ecumenism emerge, we turn a blind eye. If a priest is an ecumenist or a liberal, it’s fine as long as he remains with us. Whether he is conservative or a zealot, it doesn’t matter—just as long as he stays. This is the sickness that has taken hold.

Consider the events of 2020: *"You need to do this, you need to do that, you need to comply with many things."* The response? *"We don’t care. Oh, we’re supposed to do this? Fine, let’s do it."* Then came the war in 2022, and the media declared who the "bad guys" and "good guys" were. In one place, the media said these were the bad guys and those were the good guys—so we agreed. In another place, the media said the exact opposite—so we agreed with that too. As long as the funding and activities continue, everything is fine. This is the essence of being neither cold nor hot, brothers and sisters.

The Gospel teaches, *"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake"* (Matthew 5:10). Those who hold fast to the righteousness of Christ are called to speak out—whether against the government, society, or any other force—and declare, *"This is evil."* Do we hear much of that today? Almost none. If criticism does arise, it is often aligned with propaganda. If the propaganda says certain groups are bad, then the Church echoes, *"Yes, they are bad—the sodomites and others."* But this is not true courage or faithfulness. It is lukewarmness, and it is precisely what the Lord condemns.

If the propaganda says the opposite, we remain silent—or worse, we support it. God does not need such a church. He says, *"I will spit you out."* If you continue in this lukewarm state, He will reject you. But now, He criticizes you because He loves you. He has hope that you will change, that you will repent. And He tells you what to do. Let us continue with verse 18:

*"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see."*

What does this mean? The *"gold tried in the fire"* refers to the saints—the people or movements within the Church who have remained faithful to the truth despite trials and tribulations. The Lord is saying, *"Now, as a Church, you must value these people. Seek them out, make them part of you, so that you may become rich in spirit and fulfill your purpose."* These individuals, traditions, publications, methods of spiritual life, or true monasteries—these are the treasures that can transform the Church if you embrace them.

The *"white raiment"* symbolizes purity—the truly pure in heart. You must seek after such people, for they will cover your spiritual nakedness. And the *"eyesalve"* represents spiritual practices: the Jesus Prayer, hesychasm, the struggle against passions, chastity, and other disciplines. Engage in these practices, and you will gain spiritual sight. Without them, you are lost.

*"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."* Despite all the problems, the Lord has hope for this Church. He says, *"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."* The Lord is knocking at the hearts of those within the Church. Entering the Orthodox Church is not the end—it is the beginning of the journey. Do not think that anything is guaranteed. You must seek the truth with all your strength, every day, and open your heart to the Lord so that He may transform your thoughts, your life, and your heart. Only then will you truly find Christ, and He will come and dwell with you.

Do not assume that a baptismal certificate guarantees salvation. No, it does not. You can remain at the superficial level of the Laodicean Church, and that will be your downfall if you do not take the next step. You must hear the voice of Jesus Christ, the living God. *"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."*

Even within this Laodicean period, there will be those who overcome—those who defeat the enemy. Do not be mistaken; you must be among them, brothers and sisters. We must prepare for this spiritual struggle. Just as in a university, most people may not want to study, but if you are diligent, you can excel and become a great mathematician, scientist, or whatever you aspire to be. Do not let the overall lack of zeal discourage you. This is still the right place to be. There is no better place; everything else is counterfeit. Only here, in the Orthodox Church, can you attain the grace of the Lord and be among those who overcome and triumph.

During this time, as we celebrate Christmas, brothers and sisters, let us ask the Lord to awaken us. Let us pray for hearts that are alive, hearts that seek Him earnestly, hearts that cast away everything opposed to the love of Christ—everything contrary to holiness, chastity, truth, and righteousness. With such hearts and such a purpose, we can be among those who overcome. We will be victorious with Christ and will sit with Him on His throne, at the right hand of God the Father. 

Amen. May this be so. And Merry Christmas, brothers and sisters. Amen.
