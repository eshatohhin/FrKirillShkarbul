# Points of Hacking the Orthodox Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about how the devil is attempting to deceive Orthodox Christians. For him, this is the greatest prize, the ultimate success, because those who are united with the Body of Christ possess the promises and the rightful path to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Essentially, they are the presence of God in this world, as they are His witnesses. Deceiving them would deprive the world of truth and even the hope of salvation. Indeed, there is no salvation outside the Church—the Orthodox Church. Other denominations that believe in Jesus have a chance to be saved only if they align themselves with the truth found within the Orthodox Church. In doing so, they become catechumens.

This brings me to another point I wish to address today: how the devil is infiltrating the Orthodox Church. In fact, he is also targeting other Christians, including heterodox groups. I have identified at least ten of these points of infiltration, and it is quite alarming how the devil uses true Christian ideas and faith to deceive. He twists them, imposing his own meanings and drawing false conclusions. We see that he even attempted to deceive Christ Himself by misusing Scripture in the desert. This demonstrates his cunning nature.

Often, we assume that danger comes from obvious sins we commit or from external threats—heresies, sects, or philosophies outside the Church. We tend to think that everything within the Church is inherently good. However, today we will see that this is not as straightforward as it seems. The current conflicts and divisions within the Orthodox Church between different factions are partly a result of this deception. The devil seeks to deceive even the chosen ones, as stated in Matthew 24 and Mark 13. For example, in Matthew 24:24, it is written, "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect." The devil strives, to the extent possible, to deceive the elect, and I can attest that he has succeeded on many occasions.

So, how does he accomplish this? Before delving deeper, I want to reference 1 Peter 5:8, where the Apostle Peter warns, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world." The original Greek text emphasizes not merely resisting passively but engaging in active spiritual warfare. The word used implies a fight, a battle, not avoidance or indifference. Therefore, our aim is to stand firm and confront the devil, not to relax or ignore the threat.

This is in stark contrast to the Protestant notion of "relax, hallelujah, you're justified, hallelujah." There is no room for complacency in the Christian life. If you wish to be a true Christian, you must remain vigilant, for you are called to withstand the devil and evil, both within yourself and in the world.

Now, let us examine the tactics the devil employs. One of his primary strategies, especially evident in times of war, is to undermine the value of life. For Christians, there are things more important than life itself. Those who incite others to go to war often misuse the words of Christ to justify their actions.

There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for a friend. However, the devil twists this truth, leading some to believe that taking up arms and killing others is an act of love. This is the distorted conclusion many reach. People often tell me, "To avoid going to war is to go against the Christian faith because Christianity teaches that life is not the most important thing." Do you see how twisted and sick this reasoning becomes? It suggests that no matter the reason, killing your brother is justified because life itself is deemed worthless. "Don’t worry about your life," they say, "there are tasks more important than preserving it." 

Of course, there are things more important than life, but not the tasks they demand we die for. I would willingly die for Christ if called to do so, but not for a political agenda or some other worldly cause—certainly not to help the Antichrist build his new world order. This is another tactic the devil employs. He misuses the words of Christ, who said, "Whoever is not against you is for you" (Luke 9:50). The devil twists this to create division, claiming, "Whoever is not with you is against you." In doing so, he polarizes people, forcing them to choose sides in conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia-NATO tensions, or the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

People are told, "You must be on one side. If you are with us, you are on the side of truth and blessing. Everyone else is from the devil—satanists, bringers of darkness, less than human. They are demons, worse than beasts. Kill them." The devil uses this twisted logic to divide and conquer, brainwashing people into believing that anyone who disagrees is an enemy. "If you are not with us, you are against us," they say, echoing the devil’s deception. This is how the devil manipulates minds and incites hatred.

Another common tactic in the Orthodox world is the misuse of the teaching that Christ established the Church, and salvation is found within the Church, not as individuals. Some twist this to say, "Your individual understanding is from the devil. Just do what everyone else does. We must have one mind. If everyone goes, you must follow. Any independent thought comes from your sinful mind—get rid of it. Comply. Solidarity." This mindset, reminiscent of the herd mentality seen during the French Revolution and other historical movements, replaces personal responsibility with blind obedience. 

People are told, "You don’t have to think; someone else will think for you. You don’t have to take responsibility for your actions; you are safe as long as you follow the crowd." This is an irresponsible and lazy way of life, yet many embrace it, using Orthodox theology to justify their herd mentality. In reality, they are being spiritually hacked, becoming like the herd of demon-possessed swine that rushed into the sea and drowned (Matthew 8:32). The devil uses Christian teachings to lead people into spiritual destruction, stripping them of their individuality and responsibility.

The Bible is clear that each person will be held accountable for their actions. There are countless passages that emphasize personal responsibility. Yet the devil distorts this truth, too. He misuses the words of the Apostle Paul, who said, "Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God" (Romans 13:1). Some interpret this to mean that all governments, even corrupt ones, are divinely ordained, and therefore, we must comply without question. 

This is a misunderstanding. Paul was speaking about authority in the context of order and mutual respect, such as the authority within a family, where the head of the household is respected, and there is a balance of love and sacrifice. It does not mean blind obedience to unjust or evil rulers. The devil exploits this teaching to promote compliance with oppressive systems, but true Christian faith calls us to discern and resist evil while upholding justice and truth. 

In conclusion, the devil is cunning and relentless in his efforts to deceive, even using Scripture and Christian teachings to lead people astray. We must remain vigilant, grounded in the truth, and steadfast in our faith, resisting his lies and standing firm in the love and truth of Christ.

In the past, societies were built on hierarchies not of power and domination, but of mutual respect, trust, and love. However, this has been destroyed. What we have now is a perversion of authority—anti-authority. We have an "anti-elite elite" that is irresponsible and self-serving, using power solely for personal gain. Even within families, the authority described by the Apostle Paul—rooted in love and mutual sacrifice—has been replaced by a transactional mindset: "your rights, my rights, your responsibilities, my responsibilities." Families have become more like partnerships or contracts rather than communities of love and trust. In society, the concept of a "social contract" has replaced divine authority, reducing relationships to legal agreements devoid of love and spiritual meaning. This rejection of God-given authority has led to widespread distortion and moral decay.

Another point of spiritual vulnerability is the misunderstanding of God’s providence. Some believe that everything—war, epidemics, famine—is part of God’s plan and must be passively accepted. They say, "This is God’s providence; it’s all written in prophecy, so we shouldn’t resist or act." This belief in predestination is not Orthodox. It resembles pagan fatalism, Buddhist samsara, or the worship of fortune as a goddess. True Christianity does not teach blind acceptance of suffering as divine will. Instead, it calls us to actively resist evil, alleviate suffering, and trust in God’s love and mercy, not in a deterministic view of fate.

A further issue is the tendency toward formalism, where people believe that merely performing religious rituals guarantees salvation. This mindset mirrors the legalism found in Catholicism and Protestantism. In the Orthodox world, some say, "As long as you are baptized, confess before you die, and receive Holy Communion, you’ll go to heaven. Don’t worry about the state of your heart." This is a dangerous heresy. If Christ does not dwell in your heart, no amount of sacraments, liturgy, or confession will save you. History is filled with examples of people who participated in religious rituals but lived lives devoid of love and faith. For instance, many revolutionaries who grew up in religious households and attended Sunday school later committed atrocities. When questioned, they admitted they had never truly engaged with the Gospel’s message of love—they had only kissed the Bible as a ritual. This formalism reduces faith to empty tradition, stripping it of its transformative power.

This legalistic approach, whether in the form of Catholic "opera operata" or Protestant "justification by faith alone," reduces salvation to a checklist of external actions. It portrays God as a distant judge who evaluates us based on formalities rather than the state of our hearts. True Orthodoxy rejects this. Salvation is not about ticking boxes; it is about a living, dynamic relationship with Christ, rooted in repentance, love, and transformation.

To overcome these spiritual pitfalls, we must recognize them for what they are: deceptions planted by the devil to lead us astray. These are just a few examples of how the devil infiltrates and distorts our faith. If you’re interested, I can delve deeper into other points of spiritual vulnerability and how the devil plants these "spiritual viruses" in our lives. The reason these deceptions succeed is that many people live in sin, neglecting fasting, prayer, and ascetic practices. When we fail to cultivate a life of spiritual discipline, our minds and hearts become darkened, making us easy targets for the devil’s lies.

Let us strive to live authentically, rejecting formalism, legalism, and fatalism. Let us embrace a faith that transforms our hearts, aligns us with God’s will, and equips us to resist the devil’s schemes. Only through vigilance, repentance, and a genuine relationship with Christ can we overcome these spiritual dangers and walk in the light of truth.

That is how the devil seeks to hack Orthodox Christians. May we remain vigilant, keeping watch and seeking the wisdom of Christ, His true love, and His divine guidance. In doing so, we can avoid these deceptions, errors, and traps set by the devil against the chosen ones—the children of Christ. May the Lord be with you, your families, and your friends, protecting and guiding you in all things. Amen.
