# Orthodox Papism Trying to Hack the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, the If Only Church is facing great challenges at this time. To understand and address these challenges, we need to examine what happened in the past and how the devil is attempting to destroy the Church.

One of the key temptations, even in the time of the Old Testament, was the temptation to control the Church. This temptation targeted the leaders of Israel, Judea, and the Old Testament Church, urging them not to bring people closer to the Lord but to control them. This desire for control became their ultimate goal—their pursuit of power.

Interestingly, even modern authors who discuss politics in our age, such as George Orwell in *1984*, highlight that the goal of those in power is not to improve people's lives or change their mindset or ideology. Instead, the ultimate goal is power itself. This mirrors the temptation of the devil, who said, "You will be like gods." Why obey God when you can obey yourself and create your own little world without His help? You are smart, capable, and can do it on your own. The devil himself fell victim to this temptation, desiring to be like God.

This temptation was present in the Old Testament and later manifested in the Papacy. We see this problem of Papacy infiltrating the Roman Church, then spreading to the Protestants, and eventually affecting the Orthodox Church itself. This issue of Papacy remains with us today, even within the Orthodox Church—I am not referring to the Catholics here. This temptation of Papism is now destroying the world and leading us, meaning humanity, toward the eventual rule of the Antichrist.

How is all of this connected? It is not merely a problem of administrative structure but a problem of faith. What do you believe? How do you follow Christ? How do you live by your beliefs and faith?

Imagine you want to influence someone to accept your ideas or do something they are reluctant to do. You try to persuade them but fail. What do you do next? You find someone they trust—a spouse, a child—and attempt to influence them through that person. Similarly, when the devil sought to lead Christians away from true faith and worship, he could not influence everyone directly. Instead, he needed someone they trusted to lead them astray. Thus, he persuaded people to believe in the Pope—a single figure they could trust to represent Christ. They were told to simply follow what he said.

This was the temptation, but its ultimate goal was to establish a single leader through whom the devil could transmit his influence. Over time, we see how subsequent heresies and errors in Catholicism and various spiritual practices were accepted by everyone because they were approved by the Pope. This includes the Charismatic movement of the 1970s, which was also approved by the Pope and became part of the Catholic Church—though it is not the true Church. We believe in one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, which is the Orthodox Church.

The Roman Church, once Orthodox, was tempted and pulled away from the body of Christ, the true Church. Later, the virus of Papism infiltrated the minds of everyone in the Roman Catholic world. This is why, when the Protestants broke away, their mindset was that each individual was a small Pope, needing no authority or guidance from anyone else.
