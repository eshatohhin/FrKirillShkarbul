# The Day of the Lord & the Day of the Beast

Dear brothers and sisters, all of us want to know what is going on in this world, where things are headed, what to expect, and what to prepare for.  
Well, there are different theories—conspiracy theories, official narratives, and a few others. It may sound very disorienting when we think about all these things, but in reality, things are not so difficult or complicated. However, they are not that simple either.  

Today, I want to share some thoughts and reflections in light of the Holy Gospel, what Scripture tells us, and what the revelation of St. John reveals. We know about the coming of the Day of the Lord, which will come upon everyone on this earth. In Luke 21:35, we read that this day will come like a net upon everyone who is sitting on the earth.  

First of all, we see that this day will be one for the whole world—the final day, the day of judgment, like the day of the flood. It will come upon those who are sitting on this earth. St. Gregory Palamas tells us that these words refer to people immersed in the things of this world, those who have attached their hearts completely to this world.  

In Isaiah 13:11, we also read that the Lord will burn all the lawless and sinners with fire. And in Philippians 3:20, the Apostle Paul tells us that our citizenship is in heaven, from where we await our Savior. There is a very small minority of people whose hearts will remain in heaven until the end. These people will be the holy ones, the saints. But everyone else will be immersed in and grasped by this world.  

If we look back 200 years, we see that the number of people who think about heaven today is much smaller than it was then. People don’t go to churches anymore. I’ve been to many places where the population is ten times larger, but the churches—perhaps ten in a town—are still there. Despite the population growth, those churches are empty, with perhaps ten times fewer people attending.  

This tells us that the spirit of the Antichrist is already here. It’s already coming. This apostasy, this total falling away that is happening before our very eyes, is taking place. However, don’t be surprised when something happens and people depart even further from God. They are already far away, but they will drift even further.  

We are approaching that time. We can call this the day of the prince of this world, the day of Christ. This will be the final singularity, the endpoint of this world. We, as Christians, await the new heavens and new earth. But before that, we know that the Antichrist will come. And before his coming, there will be several revolutions, so to speak.  

We have already seen many revolutions. There were the bourgeois revolutions in Europe, the so-called democratic revolutions, the industrial revolution, the financial revolution, socialist revolutions, the sexual revolution, and many religious transformations. Some of these were local, some global, and some began locally and became global. Each of these revolutions promised something good, and perhaps they brought some good. However, they also took more people away from Christ.  

Society as a whole has become more materialistic and less Christian. Today, I want to examine what happened in the Russian Empire—the Bolshevik Revolution, the October Revolution of the Bolsheviks. This revolution was essentially a rehearsal for the final revolution of the Antichrist, which is coming. You can call it inclusive capitalism, the fourth industrial revolution, human digital singularity, or other names. These terms may refer to different realities, but they all point toward the same ultimate event.

But generally speaking, that is the direction in which the world is moving. If we look back about 130 years ago, let’s consider the work of Peter Kropotkin. He was an anarchist intellectual who wrote about society, the problems of the world, and the issues facing Russia, Europe, and the United States at that time. He wrote about the global revolution that was coming.  

His views, his critiques, and the propaganda he produced painted a picture of a bright new future. He promised a more just society, free from exploitation, class wars, and conflicts. He envisioned a world of enlightenment, education, technological progress, and abundance.  

But we see what it led to. Yes, there were technological advances. Yes, more goods were produced, especially during the Soviet Union’s better days. However, all of this came at the expense of countless lives destroyed. Almost all Christians were brutally eradicated. Everyone else was brainwashed. People were given a new idol—in the capitalist system, it was money and consumption; in the socialist bloc, it was production and economic growth.  

In the socialist system, the idol was production—produce more, no matter what. People were made to feel that their value lay in their ability to produce. This materialistic thinking, coupled with the atheism that accompanied it, became pervasive. Much of what Kropotkin envisioned came true, though not all of it.  

This shows us that before that revolution, there were 100 years of preparation. Similarly, we are now in the process of preparing for the final revolution of the Antichrist. In those days, there were three types of people. The first were people like Kropotkin, who craved this new world and worked tirelessly to bring it about. The majority, however, were indifferent. They simply lived their lives, going to work, buying things, and spiritually sleeping, so to speak.  

Then there were the spiritually aware, those who understood the evil and darkness that would come with this so-called revolution. Most of these people were killed or silenced after the revolution took place.  

Today, we see similar dynamics. There are three types of people. Some are actively pushing for this new world order, each with their own vision of what it should look like. In Kropotkin’s time, revolutionaries had differing ideas, but they shared many common goals. Today, it’s the same. Some advocate for a more just world, others for diversity, social justice, peace, security, or technological advancement.  

At its core, however, this movement is about transhumanism and the creation of a new world. The blueprint for this world is no longer a secret. If we look deeply, we can see that it will push people even further away from God.  

For example, consider the push for digital currency. The problem with digital currency is not just that it will enable greater control over people’s behavior, attitudes, and values. The bigger issue is that it will materialize every aspect of life. Your thoughts, beliefs, and actions will influence your financial score, your ability to buy, and your access to resources.

What you do, what you think, whom you meet, whether you follow certain procedures—all of this will be materialized, and you will feel its impact. You cannot avoid it because it will all be linked to your digital identity and your ability to pay digitally. Everything—your thoughts, your words, your actions—will be tied to this system. Unless you completely disconnect and retreat into the forest or something similar, you will be part of it. But let’s be honest, not many people will do that.  

Even Christians may rationalize it, saying, “I’m not rejecting Christ by accepting this digital system. Why should I cut myself off from everything? It doesn’t mean I’m abandoning my faith.” Most people will accept and embrace this new world, but in doing so, they will become even more materialistic than they are now. This is just one example of how this new world will integrate and control every aspect of life.  

The majority of people today don’t know or care about these implications. They simply go with the flow, thinking, “Oh, it’s more convenient. Let’s just accept it.” Those who resist, like modern-day anarchists, will be spiritually and mentally subdued unless they find refuge in Christ. Resistance will be futile because this system will be everywhere, controlling everything.  

Very few people understand the spiritual dangers of what is coming. Those who do are often labeled as crazy, alarmist, paranoid, or conspiracy theorists. Many saints have warned that in the days of the Antichrist, anyone who speaks against the system will be seen as a madman, marginalized and dismissed.  

It’s true that we can go crazy in a bad sense if we let fear consume us or if we try to run away from everything digital. What we need is a strong spiritual life. To remain with Christ, to stay calm, to preserve peace in our hearts, and to be ready for anything—even death—we must stay close to Him. This is the answer.  

We must also remember that our spiritual battle is not against the people pushing this agenda—the so-called “bad guys” conspiring against humanity. The real problem is the spirit of apostasy that has become prevalent in the world. It’s the spirit of indifference toward Christ, God, the Gospel, and anything spiritual. People care more about shopping, earning money, and seeking pleasure than about God. This spirit is only going to grow stronger.  

May the Lord help us. May He give us courage, wisdom, and the ability to pray. May He teach us how to withstand the deception of the Antichrist and remain steadfast in Christ. Let us strive to be among those about whom the Apostle Paul says, “Our citizenship is in heaven” (Philippians 3:20). No matter what happens to us in this world, our true life is with Christ in the heavens.  

In these days, which are already upon us, even many Christians will be deceived and fall into the traps of the devil, the prince of this world. May the Lord keep us free from all this deception. May He give us pure hearts, free from the passions and temptations that torment humanity, so that we may dedicate ourselves to Christ every day of our lives.  

May the Lord give you strength and blessing. Amen.
