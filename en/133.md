# The war Why What to do What to expect

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about the war—not about our mission, but we know that on February 24th, war broke out between Russia and Ukraine, and I felt deeply depressed during those days. I could not think clearly because this was something I knew could happen, but I did not want to believe that there would come a day when it actually did.

I want to share with you some of my thoughts regarding what is happening now: why this occurred, how it came to be, how we should react to the situation, what might happen in the near future, and what the spiritual meaning of all this is. I simply wish to share some reflections on these matters.

First of all, I find it quite strange when people worry about the economy, politics, whether Ukraine will become part of Russia or Russia part of Ukraine, or if China will invade Taiwan. What will happen? The first thing to remember is that every day, hundreds of people die—children, the elderly, and innocent individuals who had no animosity toward anyone. They simply perish. Today, so many lives are lost. This is far more important than any economic crisis, lockdown, or similar concerns. Who cares about such things when a person dies—someone who lived and could have lived longer? This is not to say that these issues are unimportant, but the loss of human life is profoundly significant.

However, the struggle between Christ and the Antichrist, the coming deception of the world by Satan, is even more critical than the life or death of an individual. In this context, we turn to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, where every gospel speaks of the end times, the last days, and the years leading up to the end of the world. In Matthew 24:7, we read that nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, pandemics, and earthquakes in various places. In Matthew 10:21, the Lord says that brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death. This is what we are witnessing now.

What is happening today shatters our conventional understanding. There are Orthodox countries that trace their roots back to the baptism in the Dnieper River. The key to the kingdom is developing and maturing in the Orthodox faith, and it is glorious and good. Yet, in the broader world, society is becoming more moral and developed. It is the 21st century, and no one is supposed to kill anyone. All these myths and fairy tales are crumbling. We see that there is no faith in the majority of people. What is happening now reveals that most people are far from God. The stories about Orthodox countries are just that—stories. They are not real anymore, and perhaps they never were. At one time, more people had faith, but after 70 years of an atheist regime—marked by the killing of priests, the destruction of churches, and the eradication of religion—the people of Russia and Ukraine were deprived of their faith. This faith was not truly restored after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

I am quite familiar with the situation in Ukraine and Russia, dating back to the Soviet era. I have visited Ukraine many times because I have relatives there. Every summer, we would go there for vacation, and it felt like traveling to another part of the same country—same people, same language, everything the same. Back then, no one could have imagined a war between Ukraine and Russia. It would have been utter nonsense to suggest such a thing. No one would have believed it. But over time, hatred was promoted year after year for 30 years, leading to what we see today. This is the result of that hatred, nationalistic propaganda, and a lifestyle that prioritizes money above all else.

That is why these young people go to fight—not out of love for their homeland or any noble cause, but for money. When the conflict in Donbas began, I visited the area several times and saw the soldiers who were fighting. There were about 200 soldiers, and when a priest arrived, no one cared. They were more interested in showing off their machine guns to one another. "Priest, what are you doing here?" they asked. These are the people who are fighting. What Orthodoxy? There is nothing Orthodox about them. They are ready to fight, ready to kill, and most do it for money. This is the outcome of an atheistic era—a whole generation that cares nothing for faith, morals, or the lives of others. They are willing to kill without hesitation, and they go and do it. They will continue to kill each other. This is the reality we face today.

We should not harbor any illusions that "Oh, this is an Orthodox country; everyone must be Christian." The Orthodox Church consists of only a few scattered individuals, and I hope that everyone listening can be part of the true Church of Christ, the body and blood of Christ. These true members are few and far between—in Russia, Ukraine, and all countries. They are the Lord's flock. The rest of the world remains in darkness and hatred. It is naive to think that war would not happen. Sooner or later, it was inevitable.

Why is this happening? I believe part of the reason is the Antichrist's plan to remake the world and introduce a new system—an electronic concentration camp that people will willingly accept, even crave. To achieve this, the COVID crisis has already been exploited. Everything that could be done has been done, and people are tired of it. It is no longer enough. Therefore, it is necessary to create chaos, war, and crisis to destabilize the world. This is the next step in the Antichrist's plan to reformat the world, with an agenda to reach certain goals by 2030.

In the Bible, we read how the people cried, "Give us a king! Everything is so bad that we need a king to rule us." Similarly, the situation will worsen until people cry out for salvation. They will seek salvation through a system of electronic control, a more unified global government, or other measures. But this salvation will be Antichristian. It is all part of a larger scheme. I would be happy to be wrong, but it seems this is not a simple or straightforward matter.

So, what can we do now? I believe this is the best time to pray and to put more effort into prayer. Do not think it is pointless or that your prayers go unheard. Do not say, "I cannot influence anything," or "I do not know how to pray." Just pray as you can. Pray for the people in Ukraine, for those who suffer and die, for those filled with hatred, and for those who carry weapons. Pray that the Lord may grant them meekness of heart, break their hatred and evil intentions, and lead them to repentance. Pray that the plans of the Antichrist may be thwarted.

What we should not do is obsessively watch the news. If you constantly follow every detail of what is happening, you will drive yourself mad. I cannot bear to watch it myself. Seeing how people are killed here and there breaks my heart. If you immerse yourself in it, you may develop psychological problems. Therefore, it is better not to watch too much or follow the news too closely. Instead, focus on prayer and trust in God's plan.
