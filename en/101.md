# Heresy & Heretics

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about heresy and heretics because the spirit of ecumenism and delusion is very strong at this time. Even within the true Church, the Orthodox Church, there are people who are misled by this spirit and the ideas behind it. When we talk about heresy, we must always remember to show love toward everyone, including heretics. We must remember repentance, acknowledging that we ourselves are far worse than they are as people. We simply happen to be in the true Church, but this is not our own merit.

We also need to remember not to accuse anyone. The Lord is both just and merciful. To whom is He just? He is just to those who do not ask for His mercy. He will demand everything from them. He has said, "The judgment is mine; it is not yours." Therefore, do not judge anyone. Do not accuse anyone of anything. However, He also gave us the commandment to speak about the sins of sinners and to witness when someone is in error. We do not focus solely on our own sins. If someone is sinning or making errors that harm the Church, we must, on behalf of the Church and with the authority of the Church—not our own—indicate that this is wrong and false. We do this with love, hoping that people will repent and find the truth.

Today, we also recall the beheading of Saint John the Baptist. This occurred as a result of a dance. Remember the daughter of Herodias, who danced before Herod and his guests. They were pleased with her performance. This was, of course, an adult dance, the kind that it was. Herod, in his excitement, said, "I will give you anything, even half of my kingdom." She then asked her mother, "What should I request?" Her mother replied, "The head of John the Baptist." The girl went back and said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist." Herod, bound by his oath, had John executed and his head presented on a platter.

This event reveals the dangers of adultery, as it was an adulterous occasion when they watched this woman dance. It serves as a warning about the consequences of adult entertainment, which can lead to sin, betrayal of true love, broken marriages, and even murder. The murder of Saint John the Baptist is connected to these themes. Similarly, the idea that there is no heresy, that everyone believes in Jesus, and that everything is fine, reflects the spirit of ecumenism. This spirit is akin to adultery—a betrayal of Christ and the true Church. It may appear friendly and peaceful, but ultimately, it is a betrayal of Jesus.

To guard against this, we must understand what heresy is and who heretics are. There are at least two definitions of heresy. First, heresy is the teaching or distortion of the true faith. It involves people who believe in Christ but in the wrong way. Second, heresy can refer to a group or organization that promotes such distortions. These are two distinct concepts.

As for heretics, there are at least two types. The first type is the aggressive heretic. These individuals are convinced that their errors are correct. They do not listen to the Church, are hostile toward it, and seek to harm it by misleading thousands of people. This is a grave danger to the Church. The second type is the non-aggressive heretic. These are individuals who may have been born into a heretical family or were pagans or atheists who heard about Christ from heretics. They are drawn to the faith in Christ, not to the distortions of heresy. They are humble and seeking Christ. I am convinced that such heretics will eventually come to the true faith and the Church of Christ.

So, there are two types of heretics, and perhaps a third type could be described as the nominal heretic—someone who identifies as Catholic or Protestant but is indifferent to their faith. We won’t focus on this type now. Instead, let us discuss the main problems with heresy and why we must be cautious and avoid it entirely. In the Old Testament, there were strict prohibitions against marrying or even associating with Samaritans, pagans, Babylonians, Philistines, or other nations. Why? Because of the religious influence they could exert, which could corrupt the true and authentic faith in God. The same principle applies to heretics. Their influence can distort and spoil genuine faith in Christ.

Let us examine the kinds of influence heresy can have. The first is hidden Gnosticism. Gnostic ideas are numerous and varied. They include theism, theosophy (such as the occult teachings of Blavatsky), and other heretical beliefs that promise secret knowledge or power. These ideas often claim that through some form of magic or wisdom, one can become "chosen," superior, and enlightened compared to others. Such beliefs are rooted in pride, selfishness, and egoism. Historically, these ideas have led to destructive movements, including those associated with figures like Hitler. Gnosticism also includes capitalist ideologies that dehumanize ordinary people, treating them as expendable, as well as Masonic teachings.

In ancient times, Gnostic sects promoted ideas such as the belief that matter is inherently evil. This notion has influenced modern Protestantism. Other Gnostic ideas include the separation of God and humanity into entirely different realms—God as divine and distant, and humanity as merely carnal. These distortions have impacted both Protestantism and Catholicism. Another dangerous idea is that God is an impersonal principle of the universe rather than a personal being with whom one can have a relationship. These false teachings often disguise themselves as Christianity, claiming to believe in Christ and read the Bible, while in reality, they are filled with Gnostic and occult ideas. This is harmful because it leads people away from salvation and toward destruction and error. In essence, heresy is a form of Gnostic or occult teaching that has nothing to do with Christ but uses His name to promote its own agenda.

Another danger of heresy is syncretism. Syncretism is a form of spiritual communism that claims all religions and beliefs are essentially the same. It dismisses differences as mere historical or political constructs and encourages unity at the expense of truth. For example, it might say, "You believe in Christ, I believe in Christ, and someone else believes in Buddha—but we’re all basically the same. Let’s come together, eat pizza, and aim for unity." This spirit of syncretism appears peaceful and loving, but it is actually a form of spiritual adultery. It mimics love but lacks true connection to the living God. People who fall into this mindset are alienated from God’s protection, guidance, and wisdom. Their only recourse is to unite among themselves, creating a shallow sense of community without divine truth.

Of course, not all heresies are syncretistic. Some heresies are sectarian, emphasizing their own superiority and claiming to be the only true believers while labeling everyone else as anti-Christ. This radical, exclusionary mindset is equally dangerous and must be avoided. As members of the true Church, we must guard against this sectarian mentality. Sects are characterized by fear, a lack of love, and a closed-off, self-centered attitude. They are like a fortress of isolation, cut off from the grace and truth of God. We must strive to remain rooted in the true faith, avoiding both the false unity of syncretism and the divisiveness of sectarianism.

And we are not like that. The Holy Church cannot be like that. We must avoid this mindset when confronting heresies, as it represents another extreme on the spectrum. 

The third problem with heresies is their destructive practices. Many charismatic groups, for example, employ hypnosis, uncontrolled emotional outbursts like laughing or crying, and other behaviors that harm the human spirit, soul, and psychological health. These practices lead to family problems, personal struggles, and even demonic influence. Similarly, meditative practices in some Catholic environments, romanticized ideas about God, and other so-called "spiritual exercises" often distance people from God, distort their personalities, and create unhealthy addictions. These practices are deeply concerning. 

Not all heresies engage in such extreme practices, of course. Some are more conservative and avoid these harmful behaviors, but this does not mean they are not heresies. They are simply less overtly destructive. 

The fourth problem is that heresies, by definition, exist outside the Orthodox Church. While some heresies may appear benign or even well-intentioned, their separation from the living God leads to spiritual disorders. This spiritual decay manifests in the embrace of worldly philosophies and ideologies. For example, secular psychology rooted in Freudianism, socialism, or modern environmentalism—which can devolve into eco-terrorism or biocentrism, placing animals above humans—are often adopted by those in heretical environments. New Age ideas, elements of Buddhism and Hinduism, yoga, and other foreign practices are also embraced, despite being far removed from the Christian message. This occurs because those in heresy are spiritually decaying and lose the ability to discern what is true, right, and healthy. 

The fifth and final issue is that heresies often masquerade as churches. They claim to be churches but lack the true theology and essence of the Church. They substitute the true Church, saying, "We are the same; just come here. We have the Bible, prayer, and services." Yet, many who spend years in these denominations or congregations describe them as empty and meaningless. After decades in such places, they conclude there is no substance—only gatherings, dancing, and superficial rituals. This emptiness is a significant reason why the West is turning away from Christ. People are disillusioned with every church they attend, unable to find the true Church. This widespread disappointment leads many to abandon Christianity altogether, turning instead to New Age beliefs, Buddhism, Islam, or other sects. Some simply abandon faith entirely, worshiping money, comfort, or materialism as their new religion. 

This is the reality we face, though not everyone can see it, especially in mission environments like Taiwan. The challenge is to remain steadfast in the true faith, avoiding the pitfalls of heresy while guiding others toward the light of Christ and His Church.

People often see these things as foreign or new. They observe that everyone claims to speak about God and holds a Bible in their hands. Yet, there is a lack of true understanding, and what is presented often turns out to be empty and meaningless. Let us reflect on this.

Again, we must remember to avoid judging or accusing others. This is a significant challenge for us, and we must guard against the Pharisee spirit or the mindset of a legalist. It is wrong to dismiss everything outside the canonical Church as garbage. People are not garbage; they are precious treasures of Christ. We must be willing to die for them, pray for them, and love them. We are in the true Church not because we are exceptionally wise or righteous, but because we are great sinners—perhaps worse than anyone else. The Lord, in His mercy, brought us here, and this is not due to any merit on our part. We fail Him constantly, while many heretics, despite their errors, often serve Christ more diligently than we do, even if they lack a full understanding of Him.

The issue of spiritual adultery is crucial. Why is it important not to go along with the ecumenist agenda? Because its aim is to corrupt the Church from within. We see how pseudo-churches and false churches have been spoiled over time. They were not always ecumenist, but gradually, like the progression of adultery in society, they drifted away. Society once upheld Christian values and strong families, but over time, through literature and movies, the idea of adultery was normalized. First, it was portrayed as noble—a wife and another man loving each other while the husband was depicted as evil. Then, the next step was to question the need for marriage altogether: "If you love someone, why marry? Just live together." Eventually, this led to living with multiple partners. Adultery crept in step by step.

In the same way, ecumenist and perverse ideas infiltrate gradually, leading even those who were once strict and traditional into liberal and ecumenist thinking. We must remain vigilant and guard against this. We must stay close to Christ. When we are united with Him, living in Him, we will recognize these deceptive influences immediately. He will keep us in the truth, and we will overcome with Him. We will carry His message and let it shine brightly to everyone in this world. Amen.

May the Lord help us in this endeavor and grant us His blessing. Amen.
