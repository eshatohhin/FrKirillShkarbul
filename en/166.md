# Mission in Sri-Lanka and Mission in general (reflection)

Dear brothers and sisters, in January this year, I embarked on a mission to Sri Lanka, and it was remarkably successful. Several hundred people decided to convert to Orthodoxy. Some of them were baptized, but there is still a great project to be developed. The mission is growing, and we are in constant communication. Many initiatives, youth groups, and communities are converting to Orthodoxy in various parts of the island. Such success is quite extraordinary in our times.

Today, I want to share some thoughts on the developments there and on the mission overall, as there are many areas we need to improve in terms of our approach to mission—our attitude, what should be done, what can be done, and how it should be done. Recently, Sri Lanka has been in the news due to revolts and political issues, but that is not why I decided to talk about it. 

In fact, we should ask ourselves: if I only pay attention to the news or YouTube channels when they cover topics that everyone is talking about—some trending agenda or crisis—then there is something wrong with me. This is called worldliness. For a Christian, this is a disease. If we live only where the world lives, concerned only with what the world is concerned about—some crisis, for example—then we are missing the point. 

Sri Lanka? What about Sri Lanka? We should be completely separate from such worldly concerns. For us, the great agenda, the main agenda, is the Lord Jesus Christ and how to reach His kingdom of heaven. People might say, "Oh, no, everybody knows about that. What’s happening now?" That’s a big mistake. We are completely reversing the order of priorities. 

I want to talk about this because I have some new thoughts, and more than half a year has passed since the mission. I also want to draw some conclusions. When I was there, I recorded a couple of videos, but it was quite hectic and not very well thought through. 

So, what do I want to say today? First, let me tell you about Sri Lanka and its spiritual and religious atmosphere. It is not a healthy one. There is no place on earth that is entirely healthy, but in Sri Lanka—and in similar countries like Bali, where I have also been—the situation is particularly challenging. In Sri Lanka, the dominant religion is Buddhism, but it is a unique style of Buddhism, deeply intertwined with Sri Lankan culture. It is much worse than even here in Taiwan, where 97% of the population are pagans, many of whom are nominally Buddhist. 

In Sri Lanka, about 95-97% of the population are Buddhists and Hindus, and the spiritual environment is much worse. People worship idols everywhere, all the time. You hear strange sounds—I can’t call it prayer; it’s more like mantras. You smell the offerings brought to demons. You see demonized people on the streets, individuals who cannot control themselves. The atmosphere is deeply unhealthy, not just socially but spiritually. 

Despite this, Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with wonderful people. When they come to believe in the Lord, they are truly remarkable. On an individual level, you can talk to them, make friends with them—they are wonderful people. I don’t want to accuse the people, but I must say that the overall spiritual and religious atmosphere is very hostile to the Lord and to the individual. It is much worse than here. 

Preaching the Gospel there is very difficult. If we are talking about Sri Lanka, it is much closer to Europe and other countries where Christianity has been present for thousands of years.

To Russia, you have direct flights to Moscow, and there are other countries, like Ethiopia in Africa, that have a significant Christian population. Sri Lanka is not far from these regions, and it was colonized by the British, who were supposedly Christian—Protestants—yet there is almost no Christian presence there today. The Orthodox mission in Sri Lanka is still in its infancy, just beginning to take root. 

There are some Catholics in Sri Lanka, primarily in an enclave in the north of Colombo, likely due to historical reasons—the Portuguese arrived there and may have done some work in that area. There are also quite a few Catholics in the seashore villages. However, their influence is limited. I haven’t noticed much of a Catholic presence elsewhere on the island. 

What is more active are sects, primarily of a Protestant or charismatic nature. These groups are not tied to traditional Protestant denominations but are more fragmented and individualistic. Often, their practices are based on personal interpretations: if someone believes dancing works, they dance; if they believe in chasing demons, they chase demons. It’s a mix of rock and roll, the Bible, and "Alleluia," with everyone doing things their own way. This has led to highly heretical, sect-like worship practices. 

These groups are very active in terms of mission work, but their success is limited. Less than one percent of the population has embraced Christianity, despite their widespread efforts. Their success is even lower than in India. 

The Orthodox mission, however, has found success among these groups. Unlike the larger, more structured Protestant denominations, these sects are not heavily financed or controlled by bigger churches. As a result, they are more open to exploring different paths. Some individuals are egoistic and seek what they like, but others are genuinely pious and searching for the truth. These are the ones who find the truth in the Orthodox Church and decide to convert, often bringing their entire communities with them. 

This is how we had a strong start in the central part of the island. One pastor converted, along with his family and his entire community. He then introduced Orthodoxy to other pastors and influential community leaders across the country, leading to a rapid expansion of the mission. 

Now, more than half a year later, the Orthodox mission is growing. There are youth groups, educational programs, and plans for rescue initiatives, as the country faces severe economic challenges. Prices have skyrocketed, and basic supplies like gas are either expensive or unavailable. We hope to address some of these needs soon. 

What I can say about this mission is that there is now a significant willingness among people to become Orthodox. The challenge is not in finding people who are interested but in how much we are able to receive and support them. In many countries, like Taiwan, Mexico, or the Mariana Islands, you often struggle to find people interested in Orthodoxy. But in Sri Lanka, it’s the opposite. You go to many places, and people are eager and willing to join. 

This is a unique situation for our Orthodox mission. The growth is not just in numbers but in the depth of faith and community. It’s a promising development, and we are hopeful for what lies ahead.

They see the truth and recognize the heresy in what they once believed. They realize that their previous practices were flawed and that they desire the truth and the Kingdom of Heaven—not as they imagine it, but as it truly is. They want to be united with the Lord. The challenge now lies in whether we, as a Church, are willing to go there, guide them into Orthodoxy, and nurture their spiritual lives moving forward. 

This is where the pain lies: we lack enough missionaries and people willing to dedicate themselves to this mission. This is why I want to reflect on today’s Gospel reading from Matthew, chapter 10, verse 37. The Lord says: 

*"He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross and followeth me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life or his soul shall lose it. And he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."* 

This is the answer to our struggles. The problem is that we are unwilling to sacrifice anything for the Lord. From childhood, we are conditioned to care about our own futures, our hobbies, our interests, our desires, our health, our friends, and our careers. Everything revolves around us—our world, our family, our comfort. But when the Lord enters our lives, we are faced with a choice: Are we ready to sacrifice these things for His sake? Are we willing to break out of our comfortable worlds to follow Him, rather than our own plans? 

If we are not willing to do this, what can we possibly offer to people in distant countries and villages? Can we simply hand them a book, the Bible, and say, "Believe this and go"? That is nothing. True faith requires us to share something far deeper—the willingness to sacrifice ourselves, to follow Christ, and to reorient our entire lives and souls toward the Kingdom of Heaven. This is a profound sacrifice and a radical change, one that many of us are unwilling to make. We fear it will be painful, that we will lose everything. And yes, it will not be easy, and we will lose much. But in return, we will gain the treasures of the Kingdom of Heaven and the Lord Himself. We will live with Him in His kingdom, but it demands great sacrifice from us. 

Let us think deeply about these things. There are people out there who are willing and eager to receive the Word of God, yet here we are—lazy, selfish, and incapable of bearing fruit for the world. What kind of mission are we talking about if we are unwilling to make sacrifices? We will have no mission at all. 

Some may argue that it’s not so simple, that people in these places only follow those who give them money. While this may be partly true for some, it is not the case for the majority. Many people there do not care about money more than they care about the truth. I have seen this firsthand. I have met these people, and I am certain that when they find the truth, they are willing to die for it, to sacrifice everything for it. Not everyone, but many. 

Others might say that people become Christians simply because their families or communities are Christian, that they were born into it. But I have also seen individuals who stand alone in their faith. For example, there was a 14-year-old girl who was the only believer in Jesus Christ in her entire large family. She faced tremendous pressure because her family accused her of betraying her clan, her ancestors, and their traditions. Yet, she was willing to endure humiliation, pain, and broken relationships for the sake of her faith. She had no support, no care from her relatives, but she remained steadfast. 

This is the kind of faith we are called to nurture and support. The mission in Sri Lanka and similar places is not just about numbers or superficial conversions. It is about guiding people to the truth, helping them carry their crosses, and walking with them as they follow Christ. It is a mission that demands sacrifice, not just from them, but from us as well. Let us reflect on this and ask ourselves: Are we willing to lose our lives for His sake, so that we may truly find them?

This is the path of a martyr, a passion-bearer. There are many people like this, and we must not dismiss their struggles or assume that their lack of Orthodoxy is due to superficial reasons. Some may say, "Oh, they love the sects because they enjoy dancing in church or the charismatic practices." But this is a shallow and unfair judgment. Many of these people are not arrogant heretics; they are humble souls searching for the truth. When they encounter true worship and true faith, they embrace it wholeheartedly. 

This is often just an excuse for our own laziness, our self-centeredness, and our unwillingness to step out of our comfort zones. We stay at home, enjoying nice food, safety, and stability. We say, "Yes, I am Orthodox. Yes, I am a priest or a bishop," but everything in our lives runs smoothly according to our own plans. This is not real Christianity. This is simply living for ourselves. We have created our own lives, caring only for our own well-being. But the Lord says, *"Whoever saves his life will lose it."* We must be willing to break free from this self-centered existence and be ready to go wherever the Lord calls us, to do whatever He asks of us. This is the great demand of discipleship. 

I am deeply concerned about what many Orthodox Christians will hear when they stand before the Lord. They could have done so much, but they chose the values of this world over the treasures of heaven. They neglected eternal riches for the sake of temporary comfort. Let us pray that this problem can be overcome, that we can undergo a profound transformation in our hearts and lives. This includes me—I am no different from you. I, too, have many limitations and struggles. 

All of us need the saving power of the Lord’s resurrection to transform our hearts and minds, to make us His true disciples, and to bear witness to His resurrection and love. May the Lord help us, grant us His wisdom, and guide us on this path. Amen. God bless. 

Very soon, I will embark on another mission. I will share more details about it later, but it will be to another island. I ask for your prayers for every mission initiative we undertake. Soon, you will know more about this mission. Amen. God bless.
