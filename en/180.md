# Veil of the Theotokos whom does She protect

Dear brothers and sisters, every year on October 14th, the Holy Church celebrates the feast of the Veil, or Pokrov, or Protection of the Holy Theotokos. Today is Sunday, October 16th, but we are still in the spirit of this celebration, and I want to share with you what this feast is all about and what it means to us, especially now, while there is this misunderstanding that protection extends over the whole nation or city. We need to understand where this feast comes from, why it is so important, and why it is not celebrated in all churches.

First of all, this feast is based on a miracle that happened in the 10th century when Constantinople, at the time the capital of the Byzantine Empire and the center of the Orthodox Church, was the most important city for the Orthodox faithful. This city was surrounded by enemies, most likely Muslims invading from the Middle East. They surrounded the city, and there was not much hope for salvation. However, the people, the Emperor, and the patriarch gathered in the Church of Blachernae, an ancient church in Constantinople that housed the greatest relic: the cloth of the Mother of God, which was brought from the Holy Land in the 5th century. They gathered in this church and held an all-night vigil, praying throughout the night. This took place on October 14th (old style; October 1st in the new calendar).

In the early morning, around 4 a.m., a vision appeared to two saints who were present: Saint Andrew the Fool for Christ and his disciple, Saint Epiphanius. These two saints, along with everyone else, were praying in the church when they saw a vision of the Holy Theotokos approaching the altar in heaven. She was accompanied by a solemn procession that included Saint John the Baptist, Saint John the Theologian, and many other saints, holy people, and angels. As they approached the heavenly altar, the Mother of God took her veil, or *amophorion*—a long kerchief-like cloth—and extended it over the faithful who were praying below. This act symbolized her protection over them. Afterward, the procession departed, but the grace of her protection remained with the people.

Suddenly, the enemies surrounding the city, referred to as Saracens or pagans, fled in fear. It is not known exactly what frightened them, but they retreated, and the city was miraculously saved. This miraculous event was celebrated by the Church, and the feast of the Protection of the Holy Theotokos was established by the patriarch at that time, under Emperor Leo VI, also known as Leo the Wise.

This feast became especially significant two centuries later in Russia under the rule of Saint...

Andrew the Pious, also known as Saint Andrew of Vladimir, was a great ruler who governed in Vladimir and Suzdal. In those days, this region was considered the capital of the Russian lands and served as a northern center of power. He built a grand church dedicated to the Protection of the Mother of God, which still stands today. This church, over 800 years old, remains a significant historical and spiritual site that we can visit even now. From that time onward, the feast of the Protection of the Holy Theotokos became deeply important in Russia, and it remains so to this day. In fact, it holds even greater significance in the Russian Church compared to other Orthodox churches, though other churches also venerate the protection of the Mother of God. 

In other Orthodox traditions, the primary feast celebrating the protection of the Mother of God is the Saturday of the Akathistos, which falls on the fifth week of Great Lent. The Akathistos is a hymn of glorification dedicated to the Mother of God, written as a tribute to her miraculous acts of protection, particularly during the 7th and 8th centuries. Regardless of the specific day chosen for celebration, the veneration of the Mother of God's protection became central to the Church because the faithful recognized her unique power of intercession. They understood that she has a special ability to plead with her Son, Jesus Christ, on behalf of humanity. Moreover, her love for the faithful is akin to the boundless love of a mother—a love that is tender, forgiving, and unwavering.

We know that a mother's love is often unconditional, free from strict judgment. While a father may embody a more disciplined form of love, a mother's heart is often more lenient, especially when her child is in need. Even if her indulgence might seem unreasonable or risk spoiling the child, it reflects the depth of her compassion. This is how the faithful perceive the Mother of God: as a loving mother who intercedes for them with her Son. When she prays for them, they receive protection and grace because her Son cannot refuse her requests.

However, a question arises: why are there instances when people gather in churches, pray fervently, and yet do not receive the protection they seek? For example, in Constantinople, there were times when the city fell despite the prayers of the faithful. The most famous example is the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. During that time, the people also prayed in the same Church of Blachernae, but the city was ultimately conquered, plundered, and destroyed. Holy relics, books, and treasures were either destroyed or stolen, first by the Crusaders and later by the Ottomans. 

This raises a deeper spiritual question about the nature of divine protection and the will of God. While the Mother of God's intercession is powerful, it is ultimately subject to God's greater plan. The faithful must trust that even in times of suffering and loss, God's providence is at work, and His protection may manifest in ways beyond human understanding. The feast of the Protection of the Holy Theotokos reminds us to seek her prayers with faith and humility, trusting in the wisdom and love of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

with the eyes of a mother, with compassion and love, and intercede for us before her Son. This is the beauty of her protection—it is not based on our worthiness but on her boundless love and mercy. Even when we feel unworthy or distant from God, we can turn to her as a child turns to a mother, trusting that she will plead for us.

However, as you rightly pointed out, there are conditions for receiving this protection. It is not a magical guarantee but a spiritual reality rooted in faith, repentance, and a sincere relationship with God. If we live in sin, ignore prayer, and distance ourselves from the Church, we cannot expect divine protection to simply appear when we suddenly need it. True protection comes from a life of faith, repentance, and striving to live according to God's commandments. It is not enough to be ethnically Orthodox or to belong to a historically Christian nation. What matters is the state of our hearts and our commitment to living as true Christians.

The idea that an entire nation or city can be protected simply because of its historical or cultural ties to Orthodoxy is, as you said, a fairy tale. God's protection is not granted based on nationality or ethnicity but on the faith and repentance of individuals. The Church is not a statistical entity or a nominal membership; it is the body of Christ, made up of those who strive to live in communion with Him. These are the people who can hope for His protection, even in times of great trial.

Yet, even for those who are faithful, protection does not always mean deliverance from suffering or death. The martyrs of the Church are a powerful reminder of this. They were not spared from torture or death, but they received the ultimate protection—eternal salvation and union with Christ. Their faith and courage inspire us to trust in God's will, even when it is difficult to understand. Sometimes, His protection may not look like what we expect, but it is always rooted in His love and wisdom.

So, what should we do? We must pray, repent, and strive to live as true children of God. We must turn to the Mother of God with humility and trust, asking her to intercede for us. Even when we feel unworthy, we can approach her with the confidence of a child, knowing that her love and mercy are greater than our sins. And we must remember that divine protection is not about avoiding all suffering but about being strengthened and guided by God's grace, even in the midst of trials.

Let us not rely on empty traditions or false expectations but on a living faith and a sincere relationship with God. Let us seek the protection of the Mother of God with pure hearts, trusting that she will always intercede for us before her Son. And let us remember that, no matter what happens in this life, our ultimate protection lies in the hope of eternal salvation through Jesus Christ. 

May the Lord have mercy on us, and may the Most Holy Theotokos cover us with her protecting veil. Amen.

as her children, and she will plead on our behalf. If it is according to God's will, the miracle will happen, and we will be spared. So, let us ask the Mother of God for her protection, for her veil to be extended over us, over our relatives, and over our families. May we be integrated into the divine plan of salvation and not swept away by the tide of apostasy and perdition.

Let us pray for this protection and thank our Lord for the joy of being His children and walking this path of salvation with Him, alongside all the saints who stand with the Mother of God and who are now interceding for us and for the Church of Christ. May the Lord be with all of you, and may God bless you. Amen.
