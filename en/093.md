# Island of Rota the Jewel of the Marianas

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am on the island of Rota, and I want to introduce this island to you—its nature and its people.  
Well, of course, we are not tourists. Yes, when we come for the mission, the goal is not just to look around, take photos, or study nature and history.  
The goal is to bring the Word of God. But when I come to a new place, I try to get a sense of it, to learn more about its nature and its people.  
Because the task of a missionary is not just to deliver a message, regardless of whom you are speaking to, and simply say things.  
The goal is to engage in a dialogue. A missionary should be in dialogue, just as Christ was with the Samaritan woman. He spoke with her and talked about the mountain with the temple that was there.  
From there, they discussed religious matters. We remember the Apostle Paul, who, when he came to Athens, spoke with the people there. He told them that he had visited various places to see their temples, monuments, and statues, to understand their culture.  
He held this culture in high regard. He mentioned that he found an altar dedicated to the "unknown god," and he said, "This unknown god, whom you already worship without knowing, I will proclaim to you."  
He acknowledged their wisdom in having such a monument and used their philosophical language to explain the message of Christ, the resurrection, and salvation.  
In the same way, we need to understand the context of the place we are in. This understanding will also help me in the future when I return to Taiwan, making it easier for me to pray for these people and this land.  
So, I usually spend some time exploring and learning about the place. Today, I want to share with you what I have discovered here. My next video will focus more on missionary practices, techniques, and some of my experiences.  
But today, this video is about the island of Rota in the context of the Mariana Islands. This island is very unique. It is called the "Jewel of the Marianas."  
Among the four main inhabited islands in the Marianas, Rota is the only one that did not suffer extensive bombing, fire, or destruction during the war.  
The Marines did not take it by force through heavy fighting. There was very little combat here because the main Japanese strongholds were on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, where the major battles occurred.  
As a result, the nature of Rota remains very pristine. Some people even call it "Jurassic Park." Here, you can find trees that are perhaps five to seven meters in diameter—huge, ancient trees that are over a thousand years old.  
The place where I am now is called the Bird Sanctuary. You can hear beautiful birds singing and flying around. There are very special doves here, colorful and greenish, along with other unique bird species.  
There are also deer. I saw some just two days ago on the plateau. The coastal reef is stunning as well.  
This is the nature of Rota. Butterflies, plants, and animals—many of them are endemic, and I am sure there are species unique to this island.  
One reason Rota did not become a stronghold for the Japanese is its landscape. Unlike Tinian, it is not flat.  
For planes, tanks, and other fortifications, the terrain is not very convenient. Even for transportation, climbing the mountains behind me is not easy.  
So, the island was not developed in the same way as others. It is a volcanic island, like the others, but it has a unique shape.  
The geology here is characterized by plateaus—like tables. In some places, there are three levels, and in others, four. Behind me, they merge into a higher cliff.

But in other places, you simply ascend to the next level, and it feels flat—not like a mountain at all.  
Only the first level, near the shore, is inhabited, with villages and people. The higher levels are abandoned. You can sense that farming once took place here; the roads are still visible.  
But now, it’s all deserted. No one wants it. In fact, the land is being offered for free. You could work it, produce something, but no one is interested.  
People have become lazy, and it’s not profitable, so the land remains unused, gradually turning into a natural park.  
These plateaus, especially during the dry season, resemble savannas. It’s hard to believe this is the Pacific Ocean.  
Deer roam freely, much like in hunting or photography scenes from movies. It’s quite fascinating.  

That’s the nature of the island itself. The rocks are black, volcanic in origin, with some areas covered in ash.  
There are rock formations that seem to hang in the air, remnants of volcanic eruptions rich in metals.  
In the mountains, there’s sulfur. The Japanese mined it extensively, and there was also sugarcane farming. Now, all of that is gone.  
There are no factories, no production, no farming—just a few cattle and pigs wandering the jungle, foraging for food.  

Beyond the natural beauty, I’d like to share my personal impression. When I first saw Rota from Guam, it appeared in the mist, rising out of the ocean.  
It didn’t look flat; it jutted out mysteriously, like something out of a voyager’s tale from the age of Magellan.  
It felt like an untouched, miraculous island in the middle of the ocean.  

This was my first impression of Rota when I saw it from Guam. It truly is a place worth visiting, though it’s far from civilization.  
To get here, you must first fly to Guam, then to Saipan, and finally take the longest flight to Rota. It’s quite a journey.  

As you can see, there are no tourists here. I’m in a popular tourist area, the Bird Sanctuary, but it’s completely empty.  
Yesterday, I saw one local Chamorro woman drying meat on the cement railings. She simply laid it out and left it there.  
There’s no activity, no people. To understand the current situation, we need to go back to the time of Spanish explorer Magellan.  

Actually, the Spanish didn’t manage this place during Magellan’s time but later, toward the end of the 17th century.  
For 300 years, Rota was under Spanish rule. They brought Catholicism and the Spanish language.  
The Chamorro language is heavily influenced by Spanish—it’s like a broken form of it. Unlike other Pacific islands, the Spanish influence here is profound.  

This Catholic influence didn’t replace the existing pagan culture; instead, it layered on top of it.  
Today, most Chamorros practice Catholicism—they have candles, icons, and crosses—but they also believe in spirits.  

They live on such beautiful land, with stunning mountains and volcanoes, yet they rarely explore it.  
I’m here with Vlad, a Russian explorer and naturalist, who photographs these places. He says the locals have never been to many of these spots.  
The younger generation is curious and eager to explore, but the older ones seem content to stay close to home.

But because of these superstitions, they never venture far. They believe spirits inhabit the caves, cliffs, and waters, and disturbing them is taboo.  
So, they stay close to home, gathering to drink beer, eat unhealthy fried foods and sausages, and grow increasingly unhealthy, facing numerous health problems.  
Their lifestyle becomes slow, lazy, and psychologically closed off.  

When preaching the Word of God here, we also aim to show them their own land.  
We have the idea of creating an album featuring photos of the island’s beautiful, unexplored places—places they’ve never seen.  
There are no existing photos of these areas, except perhaps distant aerial shots from helicopters.  
This album would include crosses installed in some locations, commemorating the Orthodox missionaries who once came here.  
It would also serve as a tribute to God for granting such beautiful nature and islands.  

This long-term missionary project could help people see that Orthodoxy brings something good—not as a sect but as a faith that enriches their lives.  
It might help them overcome their fears, break free from their psychological, mental, and religious constraints, and open up to new possibilities.  
This could be a meaningful contribution to Chamorro culture and serve as a long-term mission strategy.  

Currently, Chamorros are deeply family- and clan-oriented. They remain within their familial and cultural systems, rarely venturing beyond.  
We don’t promote ourselves; we promote Christ and salvation.  
For those seeking the Kingdom of Heaven and the truth, they will find it in the Orthodox Church. This is the core of our mission.  

Returning to history, after the Spanish, the Northern Mariana Islands were ceded to Germany in 1899.  
Germany had a significant colonial presence in Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and other regions.  
The islands were under German control for 15 years. However, to curb German influence in the region, the League of Nations transferred the islands to Japan for 30 years.  

The Japanese developed the islands extensively, using local Chamorros, Koreans, and Filipinos as labor to build roads, farms, mines, towns, and infrastructure.  
Their efforts were noteworthy, but after World War II, from 1944 onward, the islands came under U.S. control and were largely neglected.  
The towns and infrastructure built by the Japanese have since deteriorated, reclaimed by nature over the past 80 years.  

Today, Rota has a population of just 3,000. Guam and Saipan have larger populations, but their lifestyles have also declined.  
Saipan, for instance, became a hub for casinos, gambling, and prostitution, but now even that has been abandoned.  
On Rota, the older generation, now over 70, retains traditional skills like hunting and trail-making.  
The younger generation, however, is less motivated, content with a slow, enjoyment-oriented lifestyle reliant on subsidies, beer, and minimal effort.  

This is the reality we face, and it underscores the importance of our mission—not just to preach but to inspire change, healing, and a deeper connection to both faith and the land.

It’s truly sad to see the younger children absorbed in games, disconnected from the paradise that surrounds them.  
This island, with its breathtaking nature, feels like the Eden where Adam once walked.  
You can sense it in the birdsong, in the beauty that envelops you.  
Yet, the way people live here has turned into something akin to hell—confined, stagnant, and closed off.  

They remain within their small spaces, consuming, playing games, and rarely venturing out.  
It’s a life that’s become insular, clan-oriented, and disconnected from others.  
Yet, I must also say that the people here are incredibly friendly.  
Whenever you pass by, everyone waves and greets you warmly.  
They are hospitable, eager to share a beer or a meal.  
They are kind, good-hearted people.  

But what’s missing is their union with the true Church.  
This lack of connection deprives them of the living water—the Holy Spirit and the grace that enlivens, inspires, and gives purpose to life.  
It’s this spiritual vitality that’s absent here, and it’s precisely what our mission seeks to bring.  

In my next video, I’ll share more about missionary techniques, experiences, and tips that have worked here and could be applied elsewhere.  
For now, I ask for your prayers—for this land, for its people, and for the Gospel to shine brightly in their hearts.  
May they find the path to salvation.  

God bless.
