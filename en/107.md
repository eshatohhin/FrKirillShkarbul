# There’s no salvation in a horse!

Dear brothers and sisters, when we decide to follow Christ, we need to change our entire mindset. It is not merely a matter of believing certain doctrines—believing this or that. It is about a complete transformation of the mind, the heart, and everything within us. 

Why, in the Old Testament, did almost all of Israel worship other gods? Why did they not remain faithful to the one true religion they had received? Why are there so many divisions in Christianity today, with people unwilling to stay united in one apostolic church? And why do we, as Christians—as Orthodox Christians—constantly face frustrations and struggles in our faith? Why does this happen? 

What we are witnessing, in essence, is the paganization of Christianity. That is what I call it. It retains the outward form of Christianity, but the mind and heart are no longer aligned with Christ. It has ceased to be truly Christian. 

Today, I want to address something that often escapes our attention: the gradual, step-by-step paganization of all of us. We were once pagans, and even now, as Christians, we continue to be paganized more and more, day by day. This is the result of our fallen human nature and the fallen world in which we live. 

What do I mean by this? There is a phrase in the Psalms that conveys the idea, "A horse will fail to save you." In ancient times, people rode horses into battle. To have a horse meant greater speed, dominance over your enemy, and an advantage in strength and power. Yet, the Psalmist reminds us that even this power—this additional strength and vigor that people rely on—will not save you. 

We must reflect deeply: What do we rely on in our lives? In our daily lives, we often depend on financial security, our connections with influential people, our knowledge, our diplomas, our resumes. We rely on our health, a healthy lifestyle, nutritious food, and exercise. Some people even rely on higher powers. A Christian might believe that being chosen by God guarantees victory in all circumstances. Non-Christians might turn to astrology, occultism, Buddhism, meditation, numerology, or other practices. 

Others place their trust in self-help methods, psychology, or strategies for gaining influence and power—how to win friends, how to persuade people, how to achieve success. But all of these are external, false sources of power that cannot save you. In the end, what truly matters is whether God is with you or not. It is God who grants victory—or does not. If He does not grant you victory in this world, if you are defeated or conquered, it means He will grant you victory in the eternal world to come. We must have this trust in Him. 

In this context, there are two things we should consider. The first is our dialogue with other religions and people. A communist might say, "Your God will not save you. Your faith is outdated, tied to feudalism and ancient ways. We communists have power, science, factories, and technology. We have gone to space. What has your God given you?" 

A capitalist might argue, "Look at our prosperity, our wealth, our abundance of goods, and our economic growth. What does your God offer? When everyone was Christian, the world was dark, dirty, and lacking in technology. Your God does not save you." 

In the Psalms, we see that foolish people say, "There is no salvation in your God. Your God does not save you." This is why the people of the Old Testament failed to remain loyal to God. They saw the prosperity of other nations and turned to their gods, hoping to gain similar blessings. 

Let us not fall into the same trap. Let us remember that true salvation comes not from horses, wealth, knowledge, or any earthly power, but from God alone. He is our ultimate source of strength, victory, and eternal life.

And some think, "If we have a strong army, we will surely win." Others believe that a stronger economy, industry, or science will secure their future. People place their trust in all sorts of things. 

This is evident in our dialogues with others—pagans, communists, modern occultists, agnostics, and neo-pagans. These new age thinkers might say, "Look at us—we meditate, live healthy lifestyles, eat carrots, and are so healthy. But you, with your God, are overweight, sick, and struggling. Why should I believe in your God?" 

We must engage in conversations like these, but first and foremost, we must have an honest dialogue with ourselves. The real problem is that our minds are still pagan. We must ask ourselves: What do I do when I feel lonely or face significant challenges—when I have no money, no job, no future? What do I do when I encounter frustration, danger, sickness, or the death of loved ones? Where do I turn for refuge? Do I spend the night in prayer, or do I drown my worries in drinking, partying, or seeking comfort from friends? 

What is my behavior when I am tested? The Lord says, "I will test your hearts," and He is the one who tests us. These trials will grow increasingly difficult as we approach the end times. We are already facing incredibly challenging times for the Church and the Christian faith. 

This brings us to the fundamental principle that distinguishes true Christian faith from all other beliefs, including heresies that offer substitutes. These substitutes make people more comfortable because they provide an easier path. But true faith requires unconditional reliance on the living God. It demands trust in His Word, even when it feels risky—like stepping out onto the water, as Peter did. Yet, many find refuge in other practices, religions, and philosophies because they seem safer. 

Ultimately, all these false beliefs will unite into one anti-Christian religion, for they already share the same anti-Christian principle at their core. Whether it’s a religion, philosophy, or lifestyle, they all take different forms but are fundamentally the same. 

The critical question is: What do you rely on? What is your salvation? Are you able to fully entrust yourself to God? Does your lifestyle and inner world reflect this trust? Can you endure severe testing without failing? The Lord tests us repeatedly, and often we fail because there is still a corrupted, rusty part within us. Can we fix it, or will it continue to deteriorate? 

Let us abandon all reliance on external things, as the Apostle Paul says: "The world has been crucified to me, and I to the world." This means we have no attachment to the world—no reliance on its temptations or desires. The Lord warned that temptations will come, and woe to the world because of them. They will seduce and corrupt people. We must cut off all attractions and dependencies on anything external. 

Imagine losing everything tomorrow—your property, your home, even your life. If you truly trust in God, you will say, "Everything will be fine because I trust in Him." Especially in times of sickness, job loss, or hardship, you will draw closer to the Lord, filling your heart with His presence and casting out all fear—except the fear of God Almighty. 

Let us strive for such a heart. Let us engage in the hard work of spiritual struggle to reach this state of mind. This is what it means to follow Christ, to be a Christian. It is not merely about believing certain doctrines, knowing all the dogmas, or reciting the ecumenical councils. It is about living in complete trust and reliance on God, no matter the circumstances.

May the Lord help us and give us the right orientation. Our orientation in life is something we must carefully consider. What am I counting on in my life? Am I building up more savings? Is that my primary goal behind all my work and efforts—to save for the future, to secure a pension, so that one day I can live happily? Is this the driving force behind my life? 

Or is my motivation centered on a healthy diet, lifestyle, and sports, with the hope of living 150 years? Is that what guides me? Or perhaps it’s something else—like the pursuit of knowledge, striving to become wiser and smarter, or dedicating myself to hobbies. What is the true purpose of my life? What is the fundamental force behind everything I do each day? 

When we examine these questions honestly, we may discover that our motivation is not Christ, not salvation, not the Kingdom of Heaven. This reveals that we are still entangled in paganism. 

Let us strive to change day by day, cutting out all these worldly attachments and overcoming worldly logic. The world tells us to trust in our paychecks, our savings, our health, or our knowledge. But as followers of Christ, we are called to a different way of life. Let us be "crazy" for Christ, as the world might see it, because we trust Him completely. We are fundamental in our faith, trusting His Word unconditionally. This is what defines us as His children. 

May the Lord help us and grant us His blessing. Amen.
