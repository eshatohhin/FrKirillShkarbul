# How to overcome depression

Dear brothers and sisters, there are two ways of reacting to life: a passive way and an active way, generally speaking. We always recommend that people not be passive or gloomy, but rather take action and maintain a positive outlook on life. You can do it; you can make it. However, the problem runs deeper than that. Behind these two attitudes, there often lies one of the passions, one of the eight major passions—the passion of despondency or dejection.

We know from the teachings of the holy fathers that there are eight basic passions. In this context, passion does not mean "I have a passion for sports" or "I have a passion for women." Rather, passion, in the ascetic sense, refers to something that causes suffering. It comes from the Greek verb "pashol," indicating something within our nature, within our heart, that is distorted and causes us to suffer. For example, lust or gluttony are passions that drive us to possess something. However, passions are not limited to these carnal desires. There are other passions that we may not even notice unless we are taught about asceticism from a young age or by our Christian elders, teachers, or mentors.

The passion of despondency is a passion that essentially means a person does not have God in their heart and does not want to have God. They reject God, leading to an emptiness that seeks fulfillment elsewhere. This can manifest in a negative, passive way. A person may become lazy, unwilling to do anything, preferring to sleep or escape from life. They may become very negative, and in extreme cases, this can lead to suicide, which is one way this passion expresses itself. Another way is to try to fill this emptiness with other things, which in secular terms is often referred to as depression. People might be advised by friends or psychologists to engage in activities like sports, walking in fresh air, or eating something that makes them happy, as a way to forget their pain.

If these methods do not work, and they often do not, people might be encouraged to engage in social activities, such as attending parties, conferences, or concerts, listening to music, or communicating with friends. These activities are aimed at the soul level, as opposed to the carnal level of the body. However, these solutions usually do not work either. Often, the person remains in the same state, and if the activities they engage in are sinful, the situation can worsen, driving them further away from God.

These are the typical treatments that are offered. Of course, not everyone experiences this passion so intensely. The fathers tell us that everyone has a major passion, with others present but not as strong. For some, greed might be the main passion, motivating them to seek more money, financial power, or properties. In such cases, despondency may not be their primary struggle.

To overcome despondency, the solution is to live with God. While this sounds simple, it is not easy in practice. What should be done? First, we need to be prepared and recognize that not many people choose the path of spiritual health, righteousness, goodness, and virtue. Most people do not seek to be with God; they seek other things and suffer as a result. However, we choose this path. We want to follow it. Yet, often we say, "Yes, I am a Christian. I believe in Christ. I read the Gospel." But we do not change.

I still struggle with the same passions. If I confess, I always confess the same things. Nothing seems to change, and people become disappointed with God and the Church. They leave the Church. So, what practical suggestions can we offer? We can discuss this at length, but today I want to focus on six simple points.

First, we need to master our belly—and what lies below it. Everyone understands that these two are connected. If we do not control our appetite for food—if we overindulge in tasty meals and fail to set limits—we will struggle to control other desires. Without mastering this, we cannot truly be Christians or children of God. We fall away from this path. We must be honest with ourselves. If we overeat, we will not receive God’s grace, blessing, or guidance. And this is what we seek: to become children of God. This is not automatically granted; it is given only if we are ready to receive it. When we pray, "Our Father who art in heaven," we imply that we are His children. But do we live as His children? Do others see us as such? Or do they see us as children of our desires—or even worse, as children of the devil? To live as God’s children is to receive His blessing, guidance, care, and protection, leading us to His kingdom. As Christ warned, "Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3). This brings us to the second point: repentance.

Often, we do not know how to repent. We recount our sins, saying, "I did this wrong, that wrong," but then we repeat the same mistakes. True repentance means a complete change of life, demonstrated through action. For example, if we have taken money unjustly, we must immediately return it—and even give double to the person or to the poor. Repentance requires immediate action; otherwise, it is not genuine.

Third, we must love righteousness, God, and the kingdom of heaven. We must think of God constantly throughout the day—in our work, our actions, and our interactions. If we do not, we are not truly His children. Christ must be present in everything we do—whether we read, speak, or work. Without this connection, our actions become meaningless, a waste of time, and harmful to our souls.

Fourth, we must control our speech. It is better to speak less. Wisdom lies in silence, in listening, especially in the Church. Other faithful share their experiences of faith, but we often talk too much, wanting to be heard and seen as important. This is a sin that makes us foolish. As the saying goes, only those who recognize their ignorance can begin to overcome it. If you think you are foolish, that is the first step toward wisdom. The Holy Fathers teach that a thoughtless word is worse than a thoughtless action, such as throwing a stone. Words carry great weight and can cause lasting harm.

Fifth, we must cultivate humility. True humility is recognizing our dependence on God and acknowledging our weaknesses. It is not thinking less of ourselves but thinking of ourselves less. Humility allows us to receive God’s grace and grow in virtue.

Sixth, we must pray without ceasing. Prayer is our lifeline to God. It is not just about reciting words but about maintaining a constant awareness of God’s presence. Through prayer, we align our will with His and draw strength to resist temptation and grow in holiness.

In summary, to overcome our passions and live as children of God, we must:  
1. Master our appetites.  
2. Repent with action.  
3. Love righteousness and keep God at the center of our lives.  
4. Control our speech and listen more.  
5. Cultivate humility.  
6. Pray without ceasing.  

These practices are not easy, but they are essential for spiritual growth and transformation. Let us strive to live as true children of God, seeking His grace and guidance in all things.

So, especially if our words harm someone, we must be extremely humble in what we say. Christ teaches that every word we speak should be seasoned with salt—thoughtful, meaningful, and rooted in faith. Before speaking, especially about God, we should pray, ensuring that our words do not mislead or harm others. Otherwise, we risk spreading falsehoods about God. We must also be mindful of what we leave unsaid.

Fifth, as we’ve discussed, we should not delay doing good deeds. If we plan to perform acts of mercy, help others, or do something for Christ, we should not postpone it. Do it immediately. Do it now. This is crucial. If we delay, our intentions may become divided, and our resolve may weaken. Act on your good intentions right away—do not wait for tomorrow.

Sixth, we must not desire anything unworthy of God. Do not crave things that God Himself does not value. In prayer, avoid asking for earthly, material things that are unrelated to spirituality or the kingdom of heaven. Of course, we need to earn a living, provide for our families, and fulfill our responsibilities, but these should not become the primary focus of our lives. We must distinguish between earthly and spiritual priorities. This is a separate topic—what we ask for in prayer—which we can explore in another discussion.

We must strive to think and act in ways that are worthy of God. Avoid even entertaining sinful or impure thoughts. God desires us to be clean, pure, and simple, like doves or innocent children. He wants us to have clean hearts, to be honest and truthful in our words and actions, and to love others without negativity. We should have no enemies, no regrets, and no grudges. Instead, we should be thankful to God for everything. In this way, we will truly become children of the Most High God, and His blessings will be with us.

Let us make a conscious effort to live and think in this manner, striving to become true Christians. We must not assume we are Christians if we are still frequently overcome by our passions. If these passions still dominate us, we are not yet worthy of Christ. We must set this goal before us: to improve, to grow, and to become better. With God’s grace and blessing, we can achieve this. Amen.
