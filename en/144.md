# “I came for this hour” - Why Cross No other path to Salvation

Dear brothers and sisters, we are now in the midst of Passion Week. Together with Christ, we are on the path to Golgotha. Today, I wish to speak about suffering—not only the suffering of Christ but also our own suffering, and why we endure it. This leads us to the mystery of why so few will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Consider the chosen people of Israel, those who were called, yet so few of them entered the Kingdom of Heaven. When the Lord, their Messiah, came, millions of Jews were expected to recognize Him, but they refused. His suffering stems from this refusal and rejection. This is why He was humiliated, betrayed, tried, condemned to death, and died in a painful and miserable manner.

Why did this happen? Because we often take our faith for granted. We say, "I believe in God, I believe in Jesus, of course I will go to the Kingdom of Heaven." But is it really that simple? We see that the Jews, who were much more virtuous than we are—respecting their families and parents more, laboring diligently every day, and having less corruption in their hearts and minds—still failed to recognize the Messiah. Yet, we arrogantly assume, "No problem, I'll go to heaven." We are more prideful, arrogant, selfish, and vainglorious. We have many flaws, but we fail to see them, believing instead that we are fine and good.

Today, I want to reflect on this, and in this context, we will also examine the parable of the ten virgins. Five were wise, and five were foolish. The Church recalls this parable during Passion Week to remind us of the importance of vigilance and preparation.

First, we must recognize our limitations. Each of us is constrained in many ways. We are limited by time—there is only so much we can do in the hours we have. We are limited by resources, financially and otherwise. We are limited by our passions—selfishness, stinginess, laziness, and desires that lead us to take on debt and become overwhelmed by pressure. These limitations restrict us.

In Taiwan, for example, we feel the constraints of a dense population, limited space, and crowded conditions. In economically poor countries, people are further restricted by poverty or even war, which imposes even greater hardships. We are prisoners of the conditions in which we live.

In our daily lives, we often face hardships—bad days, lack of support from like-minded individuals, and feelings of frustration about life. What can we do in such situations? We must reflect on our limitations and strive to overcome them, seeking humility, self-awareness, and a deeper connection with God. Only then can we truly prepare ourselves for the Kingdom of Heaven.

The challenges we face in life often lead us to become unproductive, disorganized, and lazy in doing what is right. We forget important things, procrastinate, and switch tasks without completing them. Our limited knowledge and various constraints make us prisoners of these limitations. So, what can be done, and how is this connected to the Passion of Christ?

Let us turn to the Gospel of John, chapter 12, to better understand this. In verse 27, as the Lord is on His way to Jerusalem, He says, "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose, I came to this hour." Here, Christ acknowledges His human fear and suffering but submits Himself to His divine mission, accepting the pain and death that await Him. He could have asked the Father to spare Him, but He chose to fulfill His purpose.

To grasp the deeper message, let us look at the preceding verses, starting with verse 24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." Christ explains that His death is necessary to bring forth abundant fruit. Similarly, for us, if our selfish desires and attachments die, we too can bear much fruit. When we let go of our ego, our possessions, our ambitions, and our self-centeredness, we can truly serve Christ and prioritize His Kingdom. This transformation is symbolized by the oil preserved by the wise virgins in the parable.

In the parable of the ten virgins, five were wise and prepared with extra oil for their lamps, while five were foolish and unprepared. When the bridegroom arrived, the wise virgins were ready and entered the celebration, but the foolish ones were left outside because they had run out of oil. This parable teaches us to be vigilant, organized, and thoughtful about our spiritual preparation. We must anticipate what we will need to enter the Kingdom of Heaven and ensure that we are ready when the time comes.

Christ calls us to pay attention to the details of our salvation, to be organized, and to think wisely about serving Him. If we cling to our old, selfish ways, we risk being unprepared, like the foolish virgins. Merely claiming to be children of God or following religious routines without true devotion is not enough. The Jews who rejected Christ, despite their virtues, failed to recognize Him in the most critical moment. As a result, they were led astray.

In John 12:26, Christ says, "If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him." This verse reminds us that true service to Christ requires following Him wholeheartedly. We must die to our old selves, prioritize His will, and prepare diligently for the Kingdom of Heaven. Only then can we hope to be honored by the Father and enter into His eternal joy. Let us reflect on these truths and strive to live wisely, with our hearts and minds focused on Christ and His Kingdom.

and that is salvation—when we are honored by God and find ourselves in the Kingdom of Heaven. We must ask ourselves: Am I where Jesus is, especially during this time of His suffering as He journeys to Golgotha? Have I set aside all my personal agendas, passions, and sins to follow Him? What does this mean for our daily lives?

Practically, it means examining how we live. Do we pray consistently, or do we pray only when it’s convenient? Do we read the Gospel and the Bible regularly, or do we neglect them because we’re too busy? We know we should study the teachings of the Holy Fathers and grow in spiritual life, but do we postpone it, thinking, "Maybe later, when I retire"? Do we labor in love, helping others and caring for those we are responsible for? Do we serve the Lord wholeheartedly, or only when it suits us? Often, we are too preoccupied with ourselves, neglecting the work of the Spirit.

The Holy Spirit, *Ruach HaKodesh*, signifies holiness, progress, and moving forward. It calls us to grow, to be strong, and to move straight toward salvation. The Spirit wants to guide us like a ship with sails, but we must prepare those sails. Without effort and focus, we will drift aimlessly. We must ask ourselves daily: What can I do to serve the Lord? How can I gather the oil of preparation for salvation? Am I moving in the right direction, or am I straying?

Spiritual life requires self-discipline, foresight, and attention to detail. Just as missing a plane by two minutes can have significant consequences, or mishandling an instrument can lead to costly repairs, small details in our spiritual journey matter greatly. Our attitude toward salvation—dying to ourselves so that we may live for Christ—must be intentional and careful.

When we hear of someone’s death, especially a famous person like a politician or writer, what is our first thought? As Christians, our concern should not be about their wealth, property, or achievements. Instead, we should ask: Where are they now? Are they with Christ in the Kingdom of Heaven? Did their life reflect a soul that embraced salvation? If not, all their worldly accomplishments mean little. True joy lies in knowing that someone has entered eternal life with Christ.

Let us, therefore, focus on the details of our spiritual lives. Let us be disciplined, thoughtful, and intentional in our pursuit of salvation. Let us prepare our lamps with the oil of faith, good works, and devotion, so that when the Bridegroom comes, we may enter the celebration with Him. This is the path to true salvation and eternal joy.

He may have achieved great things, acquired wealth, or earned distinctions, but if we know that he died in sin, hatred, or separation from God, then, honestly, it is unlikely that he is now among the saints in heaven. While his earthly accomplishments may seem significant, they pale in comparison to the eternal matters of the soul. This is what truly matters.

While we are still alive, we often get caught up in the busyness of life, thinking that so many things are important—our careers, possessions, and achievements. But in the end, there are things far more important than all of these. Perhaps we should not exhaust ourselves running around trying to fix or attain everything in this world. Instead, we need to focus on faith, on Christ, and on salvation. Are we following Him? Are we where He is? Right now, He is on the path to Golgotha, and we must desire to be with Him.

May the Lord give us hearts that seek Him above all else. May He protect us from every evil and temptation, bless us with His grace, and fill us with the joy of His salvation. May we be among the few who remain faithful to Him until the end, loving Him with all our hearts, without reservation. May we be counted among those who enter His Kingdom, and may His joy and glory rest upon us and those around us. God bless.
