# Can God tempt people How to discern temptations

Dear brothers and sisters, every day we face all kinds of temptations. Some of these temptations come from our sinful nature, some directly from the devil, some from people, circumstances, the weather, sickness, and some may even come from God. If we are able to classify and understand the nature of these different temptations, we can gain wisdom and use them for the best—for the benefit of our own spiritual life, salvation, and for the good of everyone else. 

Today, I want to explore this issue together with you, and let us begin with the Epistle of James. The first chapter of the Epistle of the Apostle James begins with these words: 

Chapter 1, verse 2: "My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him."

This wisdom is especially the wisdom of distinguishing where each temptation comes from. We see that temptations can have a very beneficial purpose for us. In fact, "take up your cross and follow me" means to face the temptations you have and follow Christ. But it's not that simple. 

In verse 12 of the same chapter, it says: "Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him."

The next verse continues: "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death."

This may seem a bit confusing at first. On one hand, we are told to rejoice in temptations because they can strengthen our faith, patience, and lead to salvation. On the other hand, we are told that temptation comes from our own desires, which lead to sin and death. If we take this literally, it may not be entirely clear. 

However, if we delve deeper into the Holy Scriptures, we find that there are different types of temptations. In both Greek and Hebrew, the same verb is used to describe being tempted, tried, or tested. In English, we use different words like "tempted," "tried," or "tested," but in the original languages, it's the same verb. 

Here, we see that God is not tempted by evil. Yet, in Hebrews 2:18, the Apostle Paul says that Christ, having been tempted Himself, is able to help those who are tempted. Jesus, who is both man and God, was tempted by the devil, as recorded in Matthew 4:1, after His baptism when He went into the wilderness. 

The saints help us understand that there are different types of temptations. In fact, temptation can come from God. In Deuteronomy 13:3, the Lord tests the people of Israel to see whether they love Him or not. There are other instances as well: God tested Abraham when He asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac. He tested Joseph, Israel, and others, including Shoshanna. 

Even Jesus tempted His disciples. In John 6:6, we read that He tested the apostle Philip by asking him how much bread they had before He multiplied the loaves, to test his faith. There are many other instances as well. 

Therefore, we need to distinguish between different types of temptations. This is a vast topic, but today I want to focus on the main points.

The main point is that we must distinguish between temptations that originate within our hearts and those that come from external sources. Temptations born in our hearts arise either from our sinful nature or from the influence of the devil. The devil whispers, and we respond, allowing the temptation to take root and develop into sin. This is the type of temptation that the Apostle James is addressing when he says, "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'" (James 1:13). 

In James' community, some people were misinterpreting the Lord's Prayer, particularly the line, "Lead us not into temptation." They reasoned that if they fell into sin, it must be because God had led them into temptation due to their inadequate prayers. This led to the dangerous belief that God was responsible for their sin. James strongly refutes this, warning against blaming God for our failures, much like Adam blamed Eve (and indirectly God) for his sin. To claim that God tempts us into sin is a grave error and a form of blasphemy.

However, there are other types of temptations that are either directly permitted by God or allowed by Him for a greater purpose. For example, in the story of Job, God permitted the devil to test Job, but this was done to demonstrate Job's faithfulness and to refine his character. Similarly, God tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his son Isaac (Genesis 22:1) and tested the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness (Deuteronomy 8:2). These trials were not meant to lead to sin but to strengthen faith and deepen one's relationship with God.

Temptations that come directly from God or are allowed by Him serve a higher purpose. They are opportunities for growth, testing, and proving one's love and faithfulness to God. When we endure these trials, we draw closer to Him, and our relationship with Him deepens. For example, when the rich young man approached Jesus and asked what he must do to inherit eternal life, Jesus told him to sell his possessions, give to the poor, and follow Him (Matthew 19:21). This was a test of the young man's willingness to prioritize God above all else. While the young man chose not to follow through, Jesus did not condemn him but acknowledged that he had chosen a different path—one that would not lead to the same level of spiritual closeness.

In contrast, temptations that come from the devil are designed to lead us into sin and separation from God. These are not tests of faith but attacks aimed at undermining our spiritual life. Unlike the trials permitted by God, which come with the assurance of His presence and the promise of growth, the devil's temptations seek to destroy and corrupt.

In summary, the key distinction lies in the source and purpose of the temptation. Temptations that arise from within us or are inspired by the devil lead to sin and must be resisted. On the other hand, trials permitted or orchestrated by God are meant to refine us, deepen our faith, and bring us closer to Him. Understanding this distinction helps us navigate temptations with wisdom and discernment, ensuring that we grow stronger in our spiritual journey rather than falling into sin.

The main distinction we must make is between temptations that arise from within us and those that come from external sources. Temptations that originate within us stem from our sinful nature or are inspired by the devil. These internal temptations often manifest as thoughts or desires that lead us toward sin—whether it’s betraying someone, stealing, giving in to anger, or other harmful actions. These are the temptations the Apostle James warns against when he says, "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'" (James 1:13). Such temptations are born in our hearts and, if not resisted, can develop into sin.

However, there are also external temptations that come upon us from outside. These can be divided into two main categories:

1. **Painful or Harmful Temptations**: These are trials that cause suffering, such as sickness, betrayal, loss, theft, physical harm, or verbal abuse. These experiences are often painful and may feel like evil is being inflicted upon us. While they may come through people or circumstances, their ultimate source is often the devil. Sometimes, we bring these temptations upon ourselves through our own foolishness—by placing ourselves in situations where we are more vulnerable to such attacks. Other times, these trials are allowed by God for reasons we may not fully understand—perhaps as a consequence of our sins or as a means of refining our faith. In these cases, we must face the suffering with patience, thankfulness, and repentance. If we respond with humility and trust in God, He may ease our burden, remove the trial, or give us the strength to endure it, as He did with the holy martyrs.

2. **Seductive Temptations**: These are temptations that appear attractive or good on the surface but are ultimately harmful and lead to sin. They may promise pleasure, satisfaction, or success, but if we give in to them, they result in spiritual harm and separation from God. These temptations also often originate from the devil, though they may come through people or circumstances. To overcome them, we must reject the seduction, choose righteousness, and remain steadfast in virtue. If we resist, we grow stronger in our faith and draw closer to God. But if we yield, we risk falling into sin and damaging our souls.

A key principle in dealing with any temptation, as taught by Saint Nicodemus of Mount Athos, is to always accuse ourselves rather than blaming others or external circumstances. When faced with painful trials, we should humbly acknowledge that they may be a consequence of our own sins and respond with repentance and meekness. This attitude of humility and self-accusation pleases God and opens the door to His mercy and help. Similarly, when faced with seductive temptations, we must reject them outright and choose righteousness. By doing so, we demonstrate our loyalty to God and our commitment to living a virtuous life.

The Apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 11:31 that if we judge ourselves, we will not be judged by God. By taking responsibility for our actions and responding to temptations with humility, repentance, and faith, we align ourselves with God’s will and remain on the path of salvation. This is the wisdom the Apostle James encourages us to seek—the ability to discern the nature of temptations and respond to them in a way that strengthens our relationship with God and leads us closer to Him.

Let us have joy when we face all kinds of temptations, for they can lead us to salvation. Brothers and sisters, let us be wise and exercise great patience, whether these temptations affect us personally, our loved ones, or the entire world. As Revelation 3:10 tells us, a great trial will come upon the whole earth to test the hearts of all people. We are approaching those days, and this test will reveal whether people are aligned with God or with worldly pursuits, such as money. There must be a final clarification, and we must prepare ourselves for that time.

As we enter the Christmas season, we await the coming of the Messiah. By keeping our hearts focused on Him, we choose to endure any temptation that may come our way, for these trials will reveal whether we truly belong to Him. This is why we face daily temptations—they prepare us for the ultimate test of faith. May the Lord grant us strength, joy, and unity with our beloved Savior. 

Jesus asked, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?" (Luke 18:8). Indeed, few will remain faithful and loyal to Him in the face of worldly distractions and the pursuit of mammon. The world will be consumed by materialism and chaos, but only a small number will remain steadfast in their devotion to Christ. May we be among those faithful few who remain loyal to Him until the end, no matter the cost. 

God bless us all, and may He strengthen our sisters and brothers in faith. Amen.
