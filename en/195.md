# What will save us if the World Collapses

Dear brothers and sisters,

Some people ask me if this year will be worse than last year, as there are various forecasts predicting economic collapse, financial reforms, the potential introduction of electronic currency that could control everyone, and other dire possibilities such as a major war, widespread internet or power shutdowns, or even another global pandemic. However, what I believe is far more important is that we keep our hearts free from the spirit of the Antichrist. If we can achieve this, then no matter what happens, we will remain with Christ and will not fall into the delusion that will be pervasive.

Regarding the end times, we can turn to the writings of the holy fathers, who have provided insights into what is to come. We are familiar with the Book of Revelation, but many other saints, such as Saint Ephraim the Syrian, have also written extensively on the subject. His works, available in both Russian and English, discuss the Antichrist, the Second Coming of Christ, and the events of those days. From what he describes, we are not yet at the worst of times, but we are certainly moving in that direction. This does not mean we should become complacent; rather, we must remain vigilant without succumbing to paranoia or fear.

Saint Ephraim, for instance, speaks of a time when injustice will reach its peak, and the world will be filled with terror and sorrow. People will search for the Word of God but will struggle to find it, as the true testimony of the Gospel will be scarce. Even now, it is increasingly difficult to find preaching that is free from heresy, political influence, or manipulation. This is true not only in heterodox communities, which are often entangled in error and worldliness, but even within the Orthodox Church, where the pure, undiluted message of the Christian faith is becoming harder to find.

In the 19th century, Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov, Bishop of the Caucasus, lamented the weakened and wounded state of the Church. If the Church was in such a condition then, it is even more so now in the 21st century. The challenges we face today are far greater, and we must not be overly optimistic. The spirit of the Antichrist is at work, seeking to corrupt Christians, including Orthodox believers, and society as a whole. As we read the writings of the holy fathers, we must remain steadfast in our faith and vigilant against the forces that seek to lead us astray.

Seraphim Rose, of course, writes extensively—perhaps even excessively—about the fears surrounding what is happening in the world. However, I believe the greatest challenge lies within each of us, not outside. That said, he does address the external problems of society: its corruption, its anti-Christian, post-Christian, post-modern, capitalist, and post-capitalist nature. He writes about the rise of cults, New Age movements, neo-paganism, and other ideologies that are corrupting children from an early age, enslaving people to sin and passion, and distorting their minds. This is the reality we face today.

We have essentially reached the end of capitalism and are moving beyond it. What lies beyond is likely a form of neo-socialism that will be totalitarian in nature. Behind this system, and behind technologies like AI, will be the spirit of the Antichrist, seeking to control everything. Many people will appear content, living within this anti-Christian paradigm that has no connection to the true God. While many speak of "God," their concept is often pantheistic, influenced by Hegel's idea of the "Geist," which, in essence, is a form of devil worship. This is the spiritual landscape we are navigating.

So, what should we do? How do we face this? I believe there are three essential elements that each of us must incorporate into our lives at all times. Without these, no amount of intelligence, reading, preparation, or material safeguards—whether insurance, weapons, or other means of protection—will suffice. 

First, we must have the Holy Gospel. It must be the book we open daily, allowing its words to dwell in our hearts. The teachings of Christ should guide our thoughts and actions, helping us grow spiritually. As Saint Seraphim of Sarov said, the Christian heart flows with the words of Holy Scripture. This must be our foundation.

Second, we must partake in the Holy Eucharist regularly. The Eucharist is the cornerstone of our spiritual life. Without it, no matter how hard we strive to be close to Christ, we will remain alienated from Him. This means preparing well, confessing our sins, and receiving Holy Communion. It also means being actively involved in the life of the Church, participating in the Divine Liturgy, and being part of the community of believers. We are not isolated individuals; we are members of the Body of Christ, the Holy Church, and must live within its Holy Tradition and communal prayer.

Third, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to the Orthodox Church. I am fully convinced—100%, even 200%—that the true Church of Christ is the Orthodox Church. While we respect those outside the Orthodox faith who believe in Christ, pray, and read the Bible, this is not enough. The spirit of delusion prevails in many communities and organizations, distorting the truth that comes from the Lord. Only within the Orthodox Church can we find the fullness of the faith, the undiluted testimony of Christ, and the means to resist the spirit of the Antichrist.

In these challenging times, let us hold fast to the Gospel, the Eucharist, and the Orthodox Church. These are our anchors in the storm, our means of remaining faithful to Christ amidst the growing darkness.

Misleading and perverting the truth of the Gospel is a grave danger. This brings us to the third essential element: prayer. Prayer must become the foundation of our daily lives. While we may not partake in Holy Communion every day, prayer and reading the Gospel must be daily practices. It is not enough to read mechanically; we must learn to pray deeply. Without praying several times a day—as often as we can—we will not learn how to communicate with God, listen to Him, or find the peace of heart needed to face Him. Prayer must accompany us wherever we go and whatever we do. Morning and evening prayers are a minimum requirement. Even when we are tired or busy, we must prioritize prayer. If we have more time, we can pray more, but the minimum must always be met because we love the Lord, trust Him, and desire to be with Him. The Jesus Prayer is also a powerful practice to incorporate into our lives.

If we have these three essentials—the Holy Gospel, the Holy Eucharist, and prayer—we will bear more fruit in our spiritual lives. We will grow in righteousness, honesty, and selflessness, learning to combat selfishness, lust, anger, and other temptations. We will be able to help others, sacrifice for them, and deepen our understanding of spirituality and the Lord. We will seek out the works of the Holy Fathers, theological lectures, books, articles, and the lives of the saints to enrich our faith. In short, these three elements form the foundation of our salvation and our journey with Christ.

Christ Himself spoke of the narrow gate and the difficult path to salvation. If we do not strive and put in the effort, we will not find or enter that gate. Many choose the broad way, but we are called to walk the narrow path, even though it is challenging. This year, as the world opens new doors for those who reject Christ and embrace the spirit of the Antichrist, we must remain steadfast. We want Christ to be our guide and Lord, not the delusions of this world.

May the Lord grant us His wisdom, fill us with His Holy Spirit, and protect us from all delusion. May He keep us spiritually vigilant and fill us with the joy of His coming, the joy of salvation, and the joy of His resurrection. May He give us the strength we need to face these challenges, glorify Him, and be His true witnesses and followers. To the Lord’s glory, may His blessing, strength, and wisdom be with each of you. God bless.
