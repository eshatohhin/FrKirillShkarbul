# Crisis of the World & Antichrist

Dear brothers and sisters, I have returned to Taiwan and would like to share with you my thoughts and feelings about what has happened in the world while I was away on my mission. During that time, I was focused on sharing my mission experiences with you, but now I’d like to say a few things about the spiritual warfare taking place in the world. I won’t focus on politics, economics, or similar topics, even though they are all related.

Events such as the situation in Afghanistan, the new outbreaks of the pandemic, the global vaccination efforts, the proposed rise of inclusive capitalism, and many other developments—even including the visit of Patriarch Bartholomew to Ukraine just a week ago—are all part of this broader context. Additionally, the involvement of the Pope in this inclusive capitalism scheme and the banning of the traditional Latin Mass are also noteworthy. While these events may seem unrelated at first glance, they might be connected if we consider everything happening as part of the ongoing struggle of the devil against Christ and His Church.

I don’t want to come across as a paranoid prophet of the apocalypse, seeing the Antichrist under every bush or in every shadow. We are not afraid of the Antichrist at all, but today I will say a few words about the Antichrist and his agenda. Before discussing the Antichrist, we must first recall what the Apostle John tells us: there are already many antichrists in the world. Who are these antichrists? They are influential individuals who act as saviors, bringing what appears to be salvation but refusing to give glory to God for it. Instead, they claim the glory for themselves, presenting themselves as the ultimate saviors. This is the spirit of the Antichrist.

Of course, they oppose the Church—sometimes openly, sometimes secretly—but they view the Church as their enemy, an obstacle, and a threat. They see the true Church of Christ and His message as a danger. To achieve their goals, they promote materialism (mammon) and other distractions, drawing people away from Christ. They are full of lies, deceit, and similar tactics. These antichrists come in various forms, but they all share this common spirit. It is out there, and we must be aware of it.

To better understand this, I’d like to reference an instance from the Acts of the Apostles, specifically chapter 12, verses 20 to 23. This passage is about Herod Agrippa. First, who was Herod Agrippa? He was the grandson of Herod the Great, who killed the infants in an attempt to destroy Christ. This Herod Agrippa was also the full brother of Herodias, the woman responsible for the death of John the Baptist. Importantly, this Herod Agrippa is not to be confused with Herod Antipas, who was the husband of Herodias and the one who ordered John the Baptist’s execution. In fact, Herod Agrippa removed Herod Antipas from power, sending him to Rome to be tried and exiled to Gaul (modern-day France).

Herod Agrippa then became the king of Judea. Although he was part of the Herodian dynasty, which was not truly Jewish, he presented himself as more Jewish than Roman. As a result, many Jews accepted him as one of their own, seeing his rule as a kind of restoration of the kingdom of Judea. He gained his power through deceit and manipulation, securing it from the Roman emperor. Herod Agrippa was proud, arrogant, and vehemently opposed to the Church. He killed the Apostle James, the first bishop of Jerusalem, and persecuted Peter, imprisoning him with plans to execute him. However, Peter was miraculously saved. In response, Herod ordered the execution of 16 guards—a brutal and selfish act that demonstrated his arrogance and cruelty.

Let us now examine what happened with Herod Agrippa. First, some background:  
"Herod was highly displeased with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but they came to him in unity, having won over Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, as their ally. They sought peace."  
So, the people of Tyre and Sidon came to Herod, seeking a peace treaty with him. Their region depended on Herod’s kingdom for sustenance, as his power was centered in Caesarea, the main city of his domain. Herod was immensely powerful, and these people came to him as supplicants, asking for his favor.  

The passage continues:  
"On an appointed day, Herod, arrayed in royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to them. The people shouted, 'It is the voice of a god and not of a man!' Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died."  

We can imagine Herod sitting on his throne, resplendent in his royal attire, speaking with authority and grandeur. The crowd, awestruck, declared, "It is the voice of a god, not a man!" But Herod failed to give glory to God, and as a result, he was struck down by an angel. He suffered a gruesome death, consumed by worms—a miserable and humiliating end.  

This is a vivid image of the Antichrist. Herod Agrippa was one of the earliest antichrists, embodying all the characteristics: he was powerful, influential, and full of arrogance and self-glory. He persecuted the Church and the holy apostles, refusing to acknowledge God’s sovereignty.  

So, what does this have to do with our world today? The Holy Father has reminded us that the spirit of the Antichrist is always present, seeking to enslave humanity, draw people away from Christ, and harm the Church. The world is currently in a profound crisis. We face worsening pandemics, poverty, hunger, and other challenges. In response, some propose that the only salvation for capitalism is "inclusive capitalism," which resembles socialism.  

We must remember that socialism also presented itself as a savior, promising liberation from exploitation and oppression. However, it was inherently atheistic and hostile to the Church. Similarly, the spirit of the Antichrist continues to manifest in various forms, offering false solutions that ultimately lead people away from God. As Christians, we must remain vigilant, discerning, and steadfast in our faith, recognizing that true salvation comes only through Christ.

So, this spirit of the Antichrist possesses all the necessary characteristics: it promises salvation through material means—mammon—and claims to build a bright future. Just as socialism once presented itself as a savior, offering liberation through material prosperity while rejecting God, we now see similar patterns in the push for "inclusive capitalism." This agenda, along with the rise of digital technologies and artificial intelligence, is marketed as the solution to humanity’s problems. Proponents claim these innovations will save people, overcome global challenges, and create a more unified world. They even suggest the need for centralized global governance structures to address crises like those in Afghanistan or ongoing wars.  

However, unlike in Herod’s time, we do not yet see a single figure, ideology, or regime openly demanding, "Glorify me, for I am saving the world." Our concern, spiritually speaking, is not primarily about the dangers of vaccines, microchips, or the potential for totalitarian control—though these are valid concerns. As Christ taught, we should not fear those who can harm the body but rather the one who can destroy the soul. Our focus must remain on fearing God and avoiding sin.  

The true danger arises when a savior or regime emerges, claiming, "Glorify me, for I am solving all your problems. You don’t need God; you only need me." When various elements—such as inclusive capitalism, digital control, and global governance—are combined in this context, we will recognize the agenda of the Antichrist. We must remain vigilant and aware of this spiritual struggle.  

Historically, the Pope of Rome has often acted as a savior, uniting nations and even leading crusades against Islam. Yet, at the same time, he has been hostile to the Orthodox Church. Today, the Vatican’s cooperation with the Council of Inclusive Capitalism raises concerns about its alignment with an anti-Christian agenda. For us Orthodox Christians, the idea of the Pope as the "vicar of Christ" carries an anti-Christian nature, as it contradicts our understanding of the Church’s unity and leadership. While we do not claim the Pope is the Antichrist, the temptation is present.  

Similarly, Patriarch Bartholomew, whom we no longer recognize, visited Ukraine under the guise of saving its Orthodox people. In reality, his actions have led to persecution and suffering for the true Orthodox faithful in Ukraine. This, too, reflects the spirit of the Antichrist.  

Let us be aware of this spiritual struggle and participate in it by drawing closer to Christ. We fight against evil not out of fear but to grow in faith and holiness. The outcomes of evil can be used to strengthen our relationship with Christ.  

As for the times ahead, should we be happy or worried? We should rejoice, for Christ’s second coming is near, and we eagerly await it. The final persecutions and the rise of the Antichrist’s agenda will provide us with opportunities to grow stronger in faith and resist evil. We are happy not because of the suffering but because these trials will refine us and prepare us for Christ’s return. Let us remain steadfast, vigilant, and joyful in our hope.

We are saddened by the ugliness of a world that is departing from Christ. Some holy fathers even expressed that they did not wish to live until the end times, for the world would become so spiritually corrupt and dominated by evil that it would no longer be a place conducive to holiness. This duality of emotions is often present in the life of the Church: we rejoice when someone encounters Christ, yet we grieve when they depart from us or when the world grows darker.  

Let us remain strong, steadfast in prayer, and close to Christ. Our ultimate goal is to learn how to love Him deeply and to abide in Him always—living in Christ, through Christ, and for His salvation. Amen. May God bless you, and may you be wise and strong in your faith.
