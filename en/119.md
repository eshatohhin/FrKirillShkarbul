# Two meanings of God’s Will. Is God really Almighty

Dear brothers and sisters, today the Holy Church celebrates the entrance of Our Lady, the Most Holy Theotokos, into the Temple.  
This event occurred when she was just three years old. Although it is not recorded in the Gospels, the Holy Church upholds this tradition from ancient times, as it is attested to by the saints. We know in detail how this event unfolded.  

However, today I will not focus on the history or the spiritual significance of this feast. There is ample material on this topic, and I encourage each of you to familiarize yourselves with the meaning of this feast.  

Instead, I want to discuss something closely related to the will of God, for the Mother of God was chosen for her mission precisely because she was able to follow His will. She was the most fitting and worthy human being for this divine task, this mission. She attained this dignity and calling from the Lord because she fully submitted herself to His will.  

This leads us to the question: What is the will of God, and how is it all-encompassing? At the same time, why do so many things seem to go against it? These two realities appear contradictory, yet both are true. Let us attempt to resolve this dilemma.  

At first glance, we believe that everything that happens in the world aligns with God's plan. We see His providence and will in all things. In our lives, we often say, "Everything that happened was according to God's will." We also affirm that He is the Almighty Lord, the ruler of this world. The title "Lord" signifies His power, authority, and majesty over all creation.  

Yet, if He is the supreme ruler, why do so many things occur that seem contrary to His will? Sin opposes His will. Satan opposes His will. In the Lord's Prayer, we pray, "Thy will be done." If we pray for His will to be done, it implies that His will is not yet fully realized in many aspects of life. We desire His will to prevail, but it may not always come to pass.  

We know that the Lord desires all to be saved, yet Scripture also tells us that not everyone will be saved. Many will follow the broad path rather than the narrow one. This means that people often act according to their own will, not God's. As we approach the end times, we see increasing apostasy. People are turning away from the Lord, rejecting family life, moral principles, and even Christianity itself. They embrace sin instead.  

Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of their sinfulness, and the world will face a similar fate. Does this mean that everything is a failure or a tragedy? St. Nicholas of Serbia reminds us that the world began with God, from a good and holy source. Its end will also be good, as it is part of God's overarching plan. Therefore, we should not be overly troubled, for all things are moving toward the final goal that the Lord has set.  

But how do we reconcile this apparent contradiction? The answer lies in understanding that there are two ways to define the will of God: a narrow definition and a broader one.  

The narrow definition of God's will refers to what He positively desires—what He actively wills to happen. For example, He wills that you repent, follow Him, and be saved.

He wills that His mission unfolds in the world. He wills that people live in chastity and holiness. These are the things He actively desires.  

However, there is another definition of God's will: what He allows. This refers to things that He does not actively desire but permits to happen. He does not stop them, even though He could if He chose to. By allowing these events, He demonstrates His sovereignty and wisdom, for He can ultimately use even the outcomes of evil for good purposes. While the event itself may be evil and produce further evil, God, in His infinite wisdom, can bring good from it.  

This does not mean we should passively accept evil. On the contrary, we are called to fight against evil, sin, and the passions. We must strive to understand and align ourselves with God's narrow will—what He truly desires for us—and do our best to fulfill it.  

This discussion raises another question: To what extent does the Lord participate in our daily lives? For example, is it God's will that we find a good deal on a car or catch a train on time? Or, if the train breaks down, is that also His will? Should we see His hand in every detail of our lives?  

The Apostle Paul instructs us to give thanks to the Lord in all circumstances—for both good and bad. This implies that God is involved in everything that happens to us. However, this perspective can lead to two potential pitfalls.  

First, we may become self-centered and vainglorious, viewing God as a servant who caters to our every need. We might think, "Everything happens because of God's will for me," and inflate our own importance. But this mindset can lead to a rude awakening when we face suffering or death and realize that God's ways are far beyond our understanding. We may discover that the God we imagined is not the true God, and it may be too late to correct our misconceptions.  

On the other hand, if we avoid this error, we risk falling into unbelief. We might think, "I am unworthy; why would God care about the details of my life?" This false humility can lead us to live as though God is absent from our lives, reducing our existence to mere chance. This is not true humility but a form of unbelief that distances us from God.  

The truth lies in balance. We must recognize that God is intimately involved in our lives, yet we must avoid reducing Him to a mere servant of our desires. We should live with gratitude, trusting that He works all things for good, even when we cannot see His hand at work. At the same time, we must remain humble, acknowledging our unworthiness while embracing His grace and love.  

In this way, we avoid both the pride of self-centeredness and the despair of unbelief, living instead in the light of God's true will and purpose for our lives.

Indeed, neither of these extremes—self-centeredness or unbelief—is what the Lord desires for us. So, how do we navigate between these two wrong mindsets? The solution lies in understanding and aligning ourselves with the will of God in a balanced and faithful way.  

First, we must trust God in the big things, not obsessing over every minor detail. We should have faith that He will not allow us to perish from hunger or fall victim to great misfortune if we remain faithful to Him, pray, and partake in the Holy Mysteries. We trust that He will guide and protect us in the major aspects of our lives.  

At the same time, we should not expect God to intervene in every small, trivial matter. We must recognize our unworthiness and avoid attaching divine significance to every little event. Instead, we cultivate a spirit of gratitude, thanking Him for everything without overanalyzing whether each detail is directly from Him. We focus not on ourselves but on living according to His commandments and trusting in His providence.  

When something unusual or miraculous happens, we should be humbly surprised, recognizing that even in our unworthiness, the Lord still cares for us. Such moments remind us of His presence and call us to rely on Him more deeply. They are not occasions for pride or vainglory but opportunities to deepen our humility and faith.  

We live in this way: trusting in God, striving to follow His will, and avoiding sin and selfishness. By submitting our sinful and egoistic will to His, we do not become slaves or robots but gain true spiritual freedom, as the Mother of God did. She became holy precisely because she fully aligned herself with God's will.  

Let us remember that the will of God has different dimensions. We trust Him, knowing that He is in control, even when the world seems chaotic or evil appears to prevail. We focus on doing what He asks of us, leaving the rest to His wisdom and providence.  

May the Lord grant us the wisdom and strength to follow His will, as the Mother of God did, especially during this holy season of Advent as we prepare for the Nativity of Christ. May He bless and guide us all. Amen.
