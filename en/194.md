# Birth of the Messiah to the Fall and Rise of many

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas. Where does this joy of Christmas come from? It doesn't come from successful shopping or a nice restaurant celebration. No, this joy comes from the salvation brought by our Lord. However, most people, most of us, don't feel this joy. If we are truly honest with ourselves, we see that we celebrate Christmas because we are supposed to celebrate. And also because we like to hear nice music, to have beautiful decorations, and to partake in these traditions. But we don't really understand the deep spiritual meaning and the spiritual reality that is coming—not on an emotional level, but on a deep spiritual level. How can we know? Well, right after celebrating Christmas, we might be the same as always. We have all our problems, all our concerns, and we're back to the whirlwind of troubles, problems, and fears. We're already thinking about the next celebration. Here in Taiwan, it's the Chinese New Year, so right after Christmas, people get ready for the Chinese New Year. Okay, the next thing is coming, and everyone is now focused on something else. 

The church fasts for 40 days before Christmas. The meaning of this Advent season is to prepare our hearts to receive the Lord, to have Him be born in our hearts. Not just to celebrate what happened 2,000 years ago, but to have this reality happen now. So we are reborn, renewed, and healed by the peace of Christ that comes into our hearts. First of all, let us take a look at what the Apostle tells us. Apostle Luke, in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2, verse 36, beginning at verse 36, speaks of Simeon, who was holding baby Jesus in his hands. He says to Mary and Joseph, "And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him, of Jesus. And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother, 'Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, the fall of many and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against. Yet a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.'" Very mysterious words, indeed. 

First of all, the Lord is coming, isn't He coming to save everyone? Why the fall of many? Many are going to fall because of His coming. So it's not going to be that fun for those who fall. And also, He says that the sword will pierce their own heart. It's also not a very joyful prophecy that the sword is going to pierce your heart. So there is something strange here. We need to think deeply. First of all, we need to stop and think that Christmas, the nativity of Christ, is a mystery. It is something that is not self-evident. It's not that simple. Yes, there is God. Now He came to earth. This is a good thing. He's going to solve our problems. He's going to help us, save us. Alleluia! Let's celebrate this thing. Okay, you got it? Simple, straightforward. We're done, finished celebrating. Okay, move on. It's not that simple. It is a mystery. It is a mystery that God has accomplished, has achieved once in the whole history of mankind, of the world, of the universe. It happened only one time—the birth of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the Savior. This event was promised from the beginning to Adam and Eve, and all these thousands of years, people were expecting, were getting ready for this event to happen. And it happened, and after that, it changed the whole world. We are now living in this new reality after the birth of Jesus Christ. This is why we're counting years A.D., Anno Domini, the Year of the Lord. So let us think about these two things—actually, about three things.

Okay, the first thing is: why the fall of many? What does it mean? The second thing: why will the sword pierce your heart, as he told Saint Mary? And the third thing, which is related, is: why didn’t He come and openly declare to everyone, "I am the Messiah, I am the Savior, the promised one whom everyone has been expecting for these many hundreds of years. Here I am. Now I’m going to show you the way, I’m going to take you to be united with God, I’m going to solve your problems. So, straightforward, no need for any difficulty searching for Me—here I am. Just come, and everything will be fine, because I am God Himself." Well, He didn’t do it that way. 

First, regarding the fall of many, we can also look at the prophet Isaiah. Chapters 7 through 9 speak about the coming of the Lord, the nativity. I really recommend that all of you read these passages during this time—both the narratives about the Messiah in Matthew and Luke, as well as Isaiah chapters 7 through 9. In chapter 8, verses 14 and 15, we read: "And He shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken." This is quite a fearful prophecy about the stumbling of some people upon the arrival of the Messiah. 

To understand why they stumbled, let’s consider Herod. When he heard that Christ, the Anointed One, the Messiah, the promised King of Israel, had come, he was told by the Magi, and he took it very seriously. He truly believed it was true—that the Messiah had come and would rule, taking over. So, what was his reaction? He wanted to kill Him. He gathered all his might and sent people to destroy everyone in Bethlehem. He didn’t care that it was his own city, his own people—no, he ordered the killing of everyone, resulting in the death of 14,000 babies. 

Think about his logic. Herod was already not so young, perhaps over 50, and now baby Jesus, the Messiah, had come. Isn’t it logical that as you get older, you would pass the reign to the Messiah? Why not? You can’t rule forever; you’re not immortal. But Herod’s mindset was, "I gained this power; it’s mine. I’ll give it to my son, not to the Messiah. I won’t give it to someone sent by God—it’s not according to my plan." That was Herod’s mindset. 

But it wasn’t just Herod. If we look back to the time of Moses, when he came down from the mountain, the people were already worshipping a golden calf. Everyone turned away so quickly. Moses was too slow, so they decided to worship the golden calf instead. The Lord was angry, Moses was angry, and he broke the stone tablets with the commandments. We see similar things happening in the times of the prophets and during David’s reign. David says, "Everyone is saying, ‘Where is your God? Why isn’t He helping?’ But I know that my God is with me." Throughout history, people have struggled to truly trust God. They don’t see Him as manifest or answering their desires in the way they expect.

They pray, but when they don’t get what they want, they give up. They think, "He’s not a real God because He’s not helping the way we asked Him." There’s something strange about this. Throughout history, there has been this tendency for people to hide from the true God. Israel, in particular, had a habit of worshipping anything but the true God—anything related to prosperity, a rich life, or the fruitfulness of the earth. They turned to false gods like Baal and Astarte. By the time the Lord came, the scribes, priests, and leaders were all busy planning how to liberate Judea from the Romans. They had their political agendas, but they were far from God. Jesus criticized them, saying, "You love money, you’re hypocrites, you’re vainglorious, you love to be praised by people, you love your status, and you love to control." They were searching for anything but God. 

And this is about us, too. Today, we need to be critical and honest with ourselves, without wearing rose-tinted glasses. We are interested in anything but God. We worry about everything except pleasing or displeasing Him. We think, "God is God. Anytime I can go, repent, heal, and recover. He’ll wait. Right now, I have so many important things to do—my plans, my family, my career, things I want to buy or sell." We worry about economics, politics, our future, the environment—everything except how the Lord sees us. The fear of the Lord is the only fear we should have. If we focus on that, everything else becomes manageable. We don’t have to worry too much about other things if we are concerned with serving and pleasing God. 

This is why the Lord gives people freedom. If you love Him, if you love the truth, if you are searching for the truth and are ready to sacrifice everything for Him—for God, whom you don’t see, who may not help you in the way you expect—then you will discover who He truly is. He is the true God, and whatever He decides, whatever He does, that is what counts. If you are ready to follow such a God—unpredictable, mysterious, sometimes seemingly unfair—if you are ready to follow Him unconditionally, He will reveal Himself to you. You will see that He is the true Messiah, and you will experience the joy of His coming. You will be among those whom Simeon spoke of as the "rising of many." You were in sin, in darkness, but now you are rising. 

Think of the harlots, tax collectors, lepers, beggars, and sinners—those marginalized people who were healed and became followers of Christ. Think of the poor fishermen from some insignificant village who became everything when they followed Christ. Their hearts were completely changed, revived, full of light and glory. They were among the "rising of many." Today, we want to be numbered among those people. We want the Lord to be born in our hearts, to reveal His light to us, to give us a sense of belonging to His flock, to become His children—sons and daughters who have entered into the mystery of His coming. 

May the Lord’s joy and blessing be with you during this time of His nativity. May this Christmas, the birth of Christ, bring true joy and celebration to your hearts. May it be the rock upon which we stand, bringing us life, salvation, meaning, and direction in our lives.

May the Lord’s joy and blessing be with you and your families during this Christmas season, as we celebrate the nativity of Christ. God bless you all.
