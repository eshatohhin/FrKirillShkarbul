# Is Hesychasm only for Monks How to “pray unceasingly”

To your brothers and sisters, the Lord said that you need to be vigilant, not to enter into temptation, and to pray to stay awake. This spiritual awakeness is directly related to prayer. The Apostle Paul tells us to pray continuously, to pray in spirit, and the Lord said that those who pray and worship the Lord in truth and spirit are the true worshipers. Only prayer can make us the true warriors of Christ, able to withstand all evil and to grow in Him day by day.

However, there are many false and fake ways of prayer. Some prayers make you proud, coming out of pride: "Oh Lord, we glorify You because of this and that." Some prayers are full of pragmatism: "Give me this, give me that," like a trade—"I did this, so give me that." This is a pagan prayer. Some prayers become mantras that people repeat continuously. Sometimes we pray, we read prayers often, but we pray in front of emptiness, without any feeling of the Lord's presence, that He is hearing us. We just read from a book. Those prayers are empty; they lack faith. The Lord Himself said that on that day, many will come and say, "Lord, Lord, we have done miracles in Your name and have cast out demons," and so on. But He will say, "I do not know you, you workers of lawlessness." So, it is not enough just to pray or to say something to the Lord.

Unfortunately, very often we are not willing to talk about this. We are ashamed to tell others how to pray, to teach our children how to pray. Even in seminaries, where future priests are educated, there is not enough emphasis on prayer. Nobody asks, "How do you pray? Do you know how to pray?" It is assumed that everyone should know how to pray, but almost nobody does. At least in seminaries, there is the practice of participation in divine services and common prayers—before meals, in the morning, and at night—but all of these often become very formal. Someone reads, "Do, do, do," and everybody is just standing there. There is a lot of formalism. Even the priests, who are supposed to be pastors and teach others, find themselves in very difficult situations when they are far away in some parish or village, encountering temptations. Life is hard—maybe family problems, financial problems, loneliness, all kinds of temptations. Without a strong spiritual foundation, they will be broken, and then the whole community will scatter.

Both the clergy and the faithful need to know what it takes to pray, what prayer reaches the Lord. To help us in this, there is a great legacy, a great tradition of hesychasm in the Orthodox Church. Hesychasts are those who saw the worldliness in the Church and dedicated their lives solely to prayer and spiritual exercises called hesychasm. All of this was inherent to every Christian in the early Church. Everyone would have a strong and focused prayer. But later, many became nominal and formal Christians. We know that at the Second Coming, the Lord said, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?" This means that true faith, those hearts alive in their communication with the Lord, will be so few that it will be hard to find.

Let us make this a fundamental spiritual goal of our lives: to adjust our prayer life. This does not cancel everything else—it does not cancel all other aspects of our spiritual life, including first and foremost the Holy Eucharist, communion, receiving the body of Christ with...

...Savior. Repentance, along with participation in the Divine Liturgy and Sunday attendance, is fundamental. This does not cancel other practices, such as reading the Gospel, morning and evening prayers, living according to the commandments of the Lord, performing deeds of mercy, and so on. All of these will become one integrated prayer, even including work, social life, family life, and studies. Everything will become one comprehensive prayer, a sacrifice to the Lord, if we have the right prayer life.

We need to think deeply about what this prayer life entails. Some people might say that Hesychasm is a monastic tradition, reserved for hermits who retreat into the desert to pray all day without worrying about other responsibilities. However, I would argue that Hesychasm simply means calming down your passions, emotions, and fantasies, and truly talking to the Lord, receiving His peace into your heart. Without this peace, our communication with the Lord becomes empty—just words without strength or power. The Lord does not need data from us; He needs our hearts. This is why it is called the prayer of the heart. It is not about emotional fervor or stirring up carnal feelings, which have nothing to do with true spirituality and can even be destructive. True prayer is about connecting with the Lord in spirit and truth.

Some may argue that one cannot practice this without being a monk or having a strong spiritual guide. While guidance is helpful, even without an experienced supervisor, we can still practice the Jesus Prayer in a minimal way. For example, praying 100 Jesus Prayers using a prayer rope—or even a necklace—can be a starting point. The prayer is simple: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." 

You might ask, "Why do I need the Jesus Prayer if I already pray morning and evening prayers and attend church?" My own experience has shown me that I often lose focus during prayer. The Jesus Prayer makes this lack of focus evident because it is short and direct, centered on calling upon Christ and asking for His mercy and forgiveness. It is deeply rooted in repentance, acknowledging our sinfulness and our need for the Lord's grace. If we cannot even maintain focus during such a simple prayer, it reveals a deeper problem: our minds and souls are damaged by sin, distracted by worldly concerns, and unable to engage in true dialogue with the Lord.

This inability to focus is a sign that our inner selves are corrupted by sin and consumed by external, fleshly concerns. We are not living according to the Spirit but are instead drowning in our own weaknesses. This is the core of all our problems, both internal and external. We must recognize that we are drowning and in desperate need of a Savior. Only Jesus Christ can save us. Through prayer, especially the Jesus Prayer, we can begin to heal, refocus our hearts, and draw closer to the Lord. Let us strive to make prayer the foundation of our lives, integrating it into every aspect of our existence, so that we may truly live in communion with God.

...the great Lent, let us prepare our hearts through prayer, repentance, and a deeper commitment to the Jesus Prayer. The Savior is not someone we merely acknowledge with a casual "Oh yes, yes, okay." No—unless we receive His saving, salvific help and power, we are drowning, losing our lives. The Jesus Prayer helps us discover this profound truth and becomes a powerful motivation to practice it, to delve into the power of hesychasm. This is not a method or a formula—do this, do that, and expect results. It is not yoga or a self-help technique. The results come from the Lord; we simply put in the effort without expecting specific outcomes. We do not pray to feel stronger, to gain peace, or to receive something tangible. Whatever the Lord decides to give is up to Him. Our focus is solely on repentance and maintaining attention, ensuring that we do not drift away from Him.

Every time you pray, you will likely discover that out of 100 repetitions, 90 times your mind will wander. You might think about your job, your dog, the news, or other distractions—memories, moods, or people pulling you away. The key is to pull yourself back, to become whole, to become one with the Spirit, self-controlled, and focused on the goal of talking to the Lord. This practice will transform every aspect of your life. It will enhance your other prayers, deepen your participation in divine services, enrich your reading of Holy Scripture, and strengthen your deeds of mercy. It will also improve your work, studies, and relationships. You will truly become a warrior of Christ.

However, the ultimate aim is not efficiency or self-improvement—it is salvation in Christ. It is about living with Him every moment, being spiritually awake and alive, and carrying His salvation within us at all times. If you find it manageable to pray the Jesus Prayer 100 times every morning, the next step is to add another 100 during the day. Stick with this routine for at least a couple of years. Do not rush for more ambitious goals. For those of us living in the world, stability in this practice is more important than quantity. Throughout the day, whenever you have a moment—waiting for someone, showering, or doing other tasks—say the prayer once or twice, or even in shorter forms: "Lord, have mercy," "Lord Jesus Christ, save me," or simply "Jesus." These shorter prayers will keep your heart in a constant state of prayer, no matter what you are doing.

This practice will make you a child of the Lord, transforming your spiritual life profoundly. May the Lord grant you the courage, motivation, and will to proceed, to become His child, His warrior, and to gain His wisdom and the peace that comes from above, dwelling in your heart. May the Lord's blessing be with you as we approach the great Lent, preparing our hearts through prayer, repentance, and a deeper connection with Him. Amen.
