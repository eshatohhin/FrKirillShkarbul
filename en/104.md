# Eradicating vainglory in the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, we remember in Genesis, when Adam and Eve sinned, the snake was responsible for deceiving them. The Lord said, "I will put enmity between the seed of the snake and the seed of the woman, and the seed of the woman, the sons of men, will strike and smite the head of the snake, and the snake will bite at their heel." What does that mean?

Well, we are material, we are physical. Although we are also spiritual, we have physical bodies and exist in this physical world. Through this physical body, through this physical nature, and through the world that we see and feel outside, we are deceived by the devil. That's why many temptations come through vision, some through other senses—through all kinds of senses. There are five physical senses.

So, it is obvious when we sin, say we have carnal sins like gluttony, lust, or the desire for material goods—we might steal or do something similar. These sins are quite evident. But there is a sin, a passion, that is not as evident. This passion is vainglory, sometimes called vanity.

The problem is that people often do not see that they sin in this way. This passion, this sin, is smuggled by people into the church. Many people are baptized, they become Christians, but they still carry those sins, those passions, the old values they had before coming into the church. They also see in the church things that are done out of this passion, and that is what I want to talk about. They think, "Well, it's normal, it's the church." But the church, as an individual, can be sick. An individual Christian can be sick, and the church can be sick as well.

We should not think that the church is holy simply because it is a church. No, the church is holy when it is repenting. When we, during the service, say, "Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner," we acknowledge that we are sinners. But then we come to the moment when the priest raises the body of Christ, breaks it, and says, "The holy gifts for the holy." Only the holy people can partake of these holy things. So, are we sinners or are we holy? Are we saints? What is the reality?

The reality is that when we acknowledge our sins, that is when the Lord considers us saints, because our hearts are turned towards Him. In the same way, if as a church we say, "Oh, we're so glorious, we're so good, we're so beautiful, everything is fine with us," we are at risk. We risk having vainglory and not having the grace of God, the glory of God. We have only this man-made glory. We can adorn ourselves with gold and make it seem like we are glorious, but we will not have any glory from God. Everything else is nothing if you do not have God's blessing, if you do not serve Him. This is why it is important to recognize this problem.

Another reason why this is serious is that we are all children of this Renaissance culture, this European worldview culture, which is very individualistic. "I am something, this is my name, blah, blah, blah, and this is my name card, and I'm something important," and so on. We read books about superheroes, we watch movies with superheroes, we have idols—those actors—and everyone watches what is happening with them. All of that is individualism. We think about ourselves, every issue, and every one of us thinks, "I am something special."

Well, the reality is that God does not care about that. He cares about the salvation of every soul, but He cares about whether you do His will, not whether you are something extraordinary or have a remarkable personality.

Okay, these are the roots of the problem.

And some examples: again, we go to church, and we think, "Okay, it's me going to church, I'm praying to the Lord, then I am today receiving the Holy Communion, or I'm not receiving the Holy Communion—it's me, Him, me, Him." We forget that this is the Church. We forget that only as the Church can we be united with Him. We are blinded by this super-focus on ourselves. "Who am I?" 

Some people are really concerned: "Okay, what I've learned, I've read these books, I've studied, I've taken some courses, and all of that makes me special in some way." But for the Lord, it is nothing. The Apostle Paul says, "Whoever thinks that he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know" (1 Corinthians 8:2). So don’t ever think that you’re knowledgeable about something. You will look foolish in the eyes of the Lord.

Another example is our focus on the battle with the passions. We know that there are eight major passions in Orthodox asceticism. We understand their relationships and how they work. But some people become overly concerned about these passions. "Okay, now I have this passion, then I have that passion, I need to overcome them." This brings the whole spiritual life into a focus on oneself—"I need to grow, I need to develop." It’s almost like becoming a Buddhist monk, constantly focused on growth, growth, growth. 

No, for us, the most important thing is to forget about yourself. The Lord said, "Whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:38). For us, the issue is not just our individual soul that we care about. No, it’s about whether we follow Christ. Do we do what He wills? What He wants? So we should not focus too much on ourselves. We should focus on looking at Christ, not at ourselves. Look at Christ, follow Him, learn how to love Him, and change our hearts and mindsets.

At the level of the whole Church, there are also problems like this. For example, some churches say, "Okay, we are a local church because our people, over many centuries, have built many monasteries, and we have this or that." And that’s why they think their church is super strong and very glorious. Some people focus on Moscow, saying, "We are the Third Rome," while others say, "Oh, we are from ancient apostolic times, we have some apostolic connection." These are the games of kindergarten, of children, of babies. While we play these games, the Antichrist is advancing. At the time when we are playing these foolish games, he is taking over countries, nations, deceiving many, and leading them astray. 

So we need to throw away all this garbage and stop playing these games. Many people, even priests, think, "What have I done for the Church? Have I served five years? I’ve done this, I’ve done that, I’ve published some books, I’ve taught some courses." It’s like writing a resume of achievements. But the Lord said, "Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing" (Matthew 6:3). Why? Because we don’t care, we don’t remember. If we’ve done something good for the Church or for the people, we should forget about it right away. It’s not me. The Lord allowed me to participate in this work. Myself, I’m nothing. I just spoil things. 

So we forget about that. We don’t tell anyone about our achievements. "Me, myself, some achievement?" No, forget about it. This is harmful for me. I want people to criticize me, to say how dumb, how bad I am. That’s when I’m happy because that helps me overcome this vainglory. Not the other way around—where I have such a big personal ego and I want everybody to think something good about it. That’s not the way. We must humble ourselves, focus on Christ, and let go of our self-centeredness.

This is not the Lord's glory. We even have this strange custom of giving medals, achievement marks, certificates, or prizes for accomplishments—letters of achievement or similar things. This is worldly. This is when the Church becomes like the secular world—worldliness creeping in. The Lord said, "You receive glory from one another, but you do not seek the glory that comes from the only God" (John 5:44). It’s contradictory. You either receive glory from others—"I glorify you, you glorify me"—or you seek glory from God. You cannot have both. When we go to places, receive applause, and everyone seems so glorious, we are deprived of the glory from God. It’s one or the other. This harms the spiritual state of the Church.

Some people say, "Our parish is so special. Our church building is old, it has history, and we have some unique icons from centuries ago." Or, "Our monastery is exceptional because a holy person lived here two centuries ago." But the Lord doesn’t care about these things. He doesn’t care about how glorious your parish or monastery appears. What matters to Him is: Who is holy in your monastery now? Who is walking the path of Christ? Perhaps in the entire country, there are only two or three such people. For example, today we celebrate Saint Silouan of Mount Athos, a great saint. In his time, there was a large monastery with 5,000 monks. But we don’t know much about the others. We know about him because he was holy. He was on the path of following Christ. That’s what matters to the Lord—that person, that life. All the other glory, all the achievements, hold little value. What counts is how many of us are on this path.

There is also a cult of personality, even in the lives of some saints. These lives were written by people after the saints’ deaths, and they often treated these saints as superheroes. This focus on personality, rather than on why they were saints, carries the spirit of vainglory. It’s more about the history of church figures, patriarchs, or bishops—how knowledgeable they were, how educated, or what they accomplished. This is historical, even secular, and not what truly matters. We should not be overly obsessed with personality. Today, it’s all about likes, subscribers, and popularity. For a Christian, what’s important is witnessing and testifying about Christ. It doesn’t matter if no one listens. It’s sad, but it’s the reality. A true Christian won’t be upset about not having likes or followers. If we want likes, we would do something else—something flashy or sensational—but that’s not our path.

Let us be mindful of these things. Let us recognize the virus of vainglory that surrounds us. Let us change our mindset so that we love it when people criticize us, saying, "You are nothing. You have no contribution." Glory to God! Such criticism makes me more humble. The lack of recognition brings me joy because I want to store up treasures in heaven, not receive glory from this fallen world. Let us have the mind of Christ, and may the Lord be with us. God bless.
