# Why we chose another “savior” Meaning of Advent.

Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday the Holy Church entered into the Christmas season, also known as Advent. It is a special time of anticipating the coming of the Lord, the Savior, into this world.  
We remember that when Christ came, the whole world was expecting a Savior, but it was not expecting Christ—it was expecting the Antichrist.  
The Israelites, the Jews, were expecting a political leader, a powerful king who would solve their economic and political problems, bring glory, wealth, and prosperity to Palestine and the people of Israel.  
The pagans, too, were waiting for a solution to the political struggles and social problems within the Roman Empire, such as moral degradation. They were philosophically searching for answers to their questions, facing all kinds of challenges at that time. They, too, were expecting a Savior. Similarly, in the East—in Persia, Babylon, and surrounding regions—the whole world was anticipating some form of salvation.  
Yet, most of these people did not receive Christ.  

A similar situation is unfolding today. The whole world is expecting the end of the world, anticipating catastrophic events while also hoping for relief or salvation from them.  
We seek salvation from pandemics, economic crises, and unemployment—South Africa, for instance, faces a 40% unemployment rate. We are grappling with new strains of viruses.  
The world is struggling. People of faith see moral decay and hope for a revival, a salvation to address these issues.  
We need salvation to solve pollution and ecological crises, poverty, and hunger. In many countries, such as East Timor, where we have a mission, people suffer from hunger. In Africa, people die from famine.  
We are deeply immersed in these problems, caught in what some call the "cycle of samsara." We anxiously follow the news, wondering what will happen next. The Davos Forum in January approaches—what decisions will be made? We are so consumed by these concerns because we are yearning for salvation.  

But salvation is not inherently bad. The real issue, unfortunately, is that most people will choose the Antichrist over Christ, including those who consider themselves Christians.  
This is why it is crucial to prepare our hearts during this Advent season, to make room for the true Christ to come and dwell within us.  
Today, I want to speak briefly about this and about the peace that comes from on high. Often during the service, the priest says, "Peace be to all." This peace, "Ireni" in Greek, is a spiritual peace from above. It is not a call to complacency or indifference. Rather, it is a profound peace that comes from the Lord Himself, who is above all these problems.  
For Him, the pandemic, economic crises, and poverty are not problems at all. He offers us joy and peace, enabling us to rise above our worries, fears, and troubles.  

However, we must choose. We must make a firm, personal decision for Christ. This is the mystery of Advent—the coming of Christ into the world, the revelation of His person.  
It is not enough to say, "I choose everything good, I reject everything bad, and I choose Christ." Nor is it sufficient to simply be baptized or call oneself a Christian. This is a deeply personal, interpersonal choice we must make.

And we make this choice once when we step onto this path, but we must also reaffirm it daily—every single day. This is akin to marriage. When we marry someone, we make a lifelong commitment, a one-time vow. Yet, we must live out that commitment every day, making the choice to honor it moment by moment. At any moment, we can falter, look elsewhere, and betray that commitment. Similarly, we betray Christ every time we sin, saying, "Lord, forgive me, I choose this sin at this moment." Why? Because we are weak, tired, or tempted by our passions.  

We are lacking in both our initial commitment and our daily, moment-by-moment dedication. This betrayal of Christ is the greatest problem we face—far greater than any pandemic or worldly crisis. The real crisis is humanity’s departure from God, our disloyalty to Christ.  

This is what we must reflect on during Advent. What does it truly mean to choose Christ? Advent is not merely about beautiful music, festive lights, shopping, or exchanging gifts. These things are good, but they are not the essence. The essence lies in five key aspects.  

**First**, we must reject self. The Lord said, "Deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow Me." Whoever loses his life for Christ’s sake will find it. Yet, we are often selfish, preoccupied with our own desires—how to enjoy ourselves, spend our time, make more money, or acquire better things. We obsess over comfort, tasty food, healthy drinks, and other worldly pleasures. But choosing Christ means forfeiting these things, abandoning them to follow Him.  

**Second**, we must choose the path of holiness, the path of the saints. This means rejecting all darkness, sin, deeds of death, passions, and evil thoughts. We strive for piety, virtue, and light. This is the path to salvation, the life Christ calls us to live.  

**Third**, we must reject the world. The Lord said, "Do not love the world or the things in the world." We must not be consumed by thoughts of tasty food, nice clothes, vacations, status, or how others perceive us. While we live in the world, these things should no longer be our priority. Those who choose the Antichrist fail to make this choice.  

**Fourth**, we must choose to create and build, not to destroy. We must avoid destroying others’ work, lives, families, or psychological well-being. Instead, we are called to build—though I will elaborate on this later.  

These are the essential aspects of choosing Christ. Advent is a time to reflect on these commitments and prepare our hearts for His coming. Let us strive to live in a way that honors Him, rejecting self, pursuing holiness, turning away from the world, and building up rather than tearing down.

We are not destroyers; we are builders. The Lord said, "Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters." In other words, those who do not gather with Christ are scattering and destroying. The Lord calls us to build—but what are we building? We are to build the kingdom of heaven in our hearts, in our families, and in the world.  

This building is tied to the creative power God has given us in our service to Him. Whether it is our family, our work, or other forms of creative commitment, it must be done with Christ. There is, however, another kind of building—the building of Babylon, the building of Mammon. We might construct grand buildings, businesses, or empires, but if they are driven by vainglory, they are part of Babylon. "Let us make a name for ourselves," we say, seeking recognition and financial success. This is not true building; it is contributing to the kingdom of Babylon that humanity is collectively constructing.  

I do not want to contribute to Babylon. I choose to step away from it. This is the fourth aspect of choosing Christ: building with Him, not for ourselves or for worldly glory.  

**Fifth**, we must choose the path of meekness, rejecting evil thoughts, retaliation, and aggression. This is the spirit we embrace. We do not push through aggressively, seeking to conquer or overcome others. If someone strikes us, we do not strike back. This is the principle we follow—humility, gentleness, and childlike innocence. Not the spoiled children we see today, but kind, good-hearted children who do not retaliate.  

This is the path we choose daily. To grow stronger and firmer on this path—a path chosen by so few—we need the discipline of fasting. Fasting is not merely about dietary rules; it is about cultivating the virtue of abstinence. By controlling our appetite for food, we learn to control other desires. The "old man" within us always wants more—more food, more comfort, more indulgence. Fasting helps us tame this inner struggle.  

During Advent, our fasting is not overly strict. We may eat fish, except on Wednesdays and Fridays, but we abstain from meat, eggs, and dairy. We also eat less overall. Beyond food, we abstain from passions like anger, lust, and greed—those forces that push us in the wrong direction. During this time, we make a greater effort to avoid quarrels, deepen our prayer life, and maintain a living connection with God.  

We commit to regular prayer—morning and evening—and find moments throughout the day to pray, even if only for five minutes. Spiritual reading, especially the Gospels and the writings of the Holy Fathers, helps align our thoughts with theirs, pulling us away from the worries and stresses of the world.  

We also engage in acts of mercy and ministry, helping others and sharing the Gospel in a gentle, non-aggressive way. This is our mission—to testify to Christ through our words and deeds.  

These practices—fasting, prayer, spiritual reading, acts of mercy, and sharing the Gospel—are the focus of Advent. They prepare us to receive the peace that comes from above. In a world filled with stress, sleeplessness, fear, and worry, this peace is not found in technology or worldly saviors. It comes only from the Lord.  

Let us use this Advent season to deepen our commitment to Christ, rejecting self, pursuing holiness, turning away from the world, building His kingdom, and walking in meekness. In doing so, we will find the true peace that surpasses all understanding.

The world today is no different from the world at the time of Christ’s coming. We are still waiting for solutions, for salvation. We look to technology to save us—to solve overpopulation, pollution, and other crises. Some even dream of escaping to Mars to save humanity from the problems of this planet.  

Let those who pursue such endeavors do so. But we, as followers of Christ, do not place our hope in these things. Our salvation does not come from technology, space exploration, or worldly solutions. Our salvation comes from Jesus Christ and God the Father.  

May the Lord grant us His peace and strengthen our faith. May He help us remain steadfast in our commitment, so that we do not fail Him daily but remain loyal to Him in every moment of our lives.  

May the Lord’s joy and guidance be with you during this Advent season, and may you find success in the spiritual journey of the Christmas season.  

Amen.
