# Pascha A Portal to Another World (Part I)

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen—indeed, He is risen!  
During these Paschal times, we greet one another with these words. We do not say "hello" or "goodbye"; instead, we say, "Christ is risen," and the response is, "Indeed, He is risen." This greeting will continue until the Ascension of the Lord, 40 days after Pascha.  

In this time, when the heavens are open and the resurrected Christ comes to His disciples, they often find themselves uncertain of where they truly reside. Are they living on earth, bound by earthly reality, or are they already living in the heavens, since the Lord has risen, conquered death, and is now present among them? This was a time of great victory over the gates that divide the profane, fallen, physical world from the heavenly realm. The Lord created both and has the power to unite them. This is why the resurrected Christ was both fully human—He ate with the apostles—and fully divine, true God at the same time.  

We enter into this reality and must strive to understand more deeply that the meaning of Pascha is not merely about observing different traditions, feasts, songs, decorations, or foods at various times of the year. No, these are only small reminders of the profound reality behind them. But what is this reality? It is the reality of leaving this profane world, which appears to live as though God does not exist, and entering into the divine reality. Christ came to break down these gates, to open this portal, and to bring us into this truth.  

To better grasp this, we can reflect on the concept of different "worlds." For example, as children, we live in a world defined by the limitations of our age—our abilities, goals, and values. As we grow older, we sometimes long for that simpler world. Then, as students, we enter another world, shaped by university life. Yet, even among students, worlds differ: some focus on their studies, while others prioritize socializing. Similarly, different faculties or fields of study create distinct worlds.  

As adults, our worlds diverge further based on our professions. An economist inhabits a world centered on international trade, GDP, and financial systems, while a housewife lives in a world defined by her household responsibilities. Even within the same field, perspectives vary—a businessman views trade through the lens of profit and opportunity, while an economist analyzes it through data and theory.  

Generational differences also create separate worlds. Our parents and grandparents lived—and continue to live—in worlds shaped by their own experiences, values, and understandings. This generational gap means they perceive events and priorities differently than we do.  

Moreover, the information we consume shapes our worldview. Media narratives, whether from YouTube, Facebook, or other sources, influence our opinions and reinforce our biases. We absorb these ideas, often believing them to be our own, while disregarding perspectives that challenge our worldview. Over time, this creates a kind of "conscience of a flea," where groups of people flock together, guided by their chosen leaders or influencers.  

In this way, we see how different worlds coexist, each shaped by unique circumstances, values, and influences. Yet, through Christ's resurrection, we are called to transcend these divisions and enter into the divine reality, where heaven and earth are united in Him.

And not to become part of this, not to be influenced by it, we as Christians must rise above this world—not physically, but spiritually. This transformation is possible only through Pascha, through the resurrection of Christ. It cannot be achieved through education, worldly knowledge, or any other means; it must happen on a spiritual level.  

For a Christian to look at this world without the power of resurrection working within them is to risk drifting away from faith. Without this power, we are swayed by the spirit of this world, the "prince of this world," who uses the prevalent forces of this age to deceive and delude us. The Lord warned us about the deceit of riches, prosperity, and other worldly allurements. If we are not grounded in the resurrection, if our faith is merely a set of beliefs, dogmas, or traditions, we will not remain steadfast in the Lord.  

We recall the words of the Apostle Paul, who spoke of the righteous people and saints of the Old Testament. They conquered armies, performed miracles, and accomplished wondrous deeds—not by their own strength, but by faith. Faith, then, is not merely what we believe; it is what we do, what we accomplish through the Lord's power and grace. Faith is active, producing fruits that testify to its reality. If our lives do not change, if our world is not transformed by the power of Christ's resurrection, then our faith is merely a lifeless shell, destined to vanish like ash in the wind.  

We have the opportunity to transcend this worldly reality. The Lord said, "You are in this world, but you do not belong to this world." He calls us to be first and foremost citizens of the kingdom of heaven, where divine realities shape our values, our inner world, and our perspective. For some, this transformation happens quickly; for others, it is more gradual. But the direction must always be toward the kingdom of heaven.  

When we speak of spiritual people, we do not mean those who are learned in theology, who can quote Scripture or write theological articles. True spirituality is not about intellectual knowledge but about living by the Spirit rather than the flesh. The Lord said that what is of the flesh produces corruption and death, while what is of the Spirit brings life. For us, the life of the kingdom of heaven is not a distant promise for after death; it is a present reality. The day of the Lord is now; salvation is here, today.  

As we grow in this spiritual life, we lose interest in many things that once captivated us. The Apostle Paul declared, "The world has been crucified to me, and I to the world." This means that the attractions of this world no longer hold power over him. Similarly, the Lord instructs us not to love the world or the things in it. This is why the prince of this world has no authority over true Christians. While the devil may bring harm or calamity—sometimes even allowed by the Lord to test or correct—the ultimate victory belongs to Christ.  

We see this in history, where societies that turned away from God faced judgment, as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Lord is patient and long-suffering, giving time for repentance. But when His judgment comes, it is decisive and transformative.  

Therefore, let us strive to live as citizens of the kingdom of heaven, allowing the power of Christ's resurrection to shape our lives, our values, and our world. Let our faith be alive, producing fruits that testify to the reality of the risen Christ in us.

And when the Lord brings judgment, it falls upon sinners and the righteous alike. Therefore, we should not be surprised when trials come, even if we strive to live righteous lives. Pascha, the resurrection of Christ, transports us into a new reality. We are no longer bound by materialism or the pragmatic concerns symbolized by the donkey in Scripture—a creature tied to the material world. The Lord, by sitting on the donkey, demonstrates His power to overcome the material world's grip on humanity. He lifts us from being "donkeys," grounded in bills, news, and worldly concerns, and transforms us into children of the kingdom of heaven.  

Though we observe the world falling deeper into chaos and sin, we do not succumb to fear or despair. We mourn for our sins and for the state of the world—blessed are those who mourn. Yet, we do not lose hope, for our belonging to the kingdom of heaven remains secure as long as we remain loyal to Christ. This transformation is possible only through Pascha, through the resurrection of the Lord, and through the power He grants to those who love and follow Him.  

With the power of Pascha, we begin to break down the wall separating us from divine reality. This wall cracks—not by our own strength, but through the Lord's blessing and power. As we dedicate ourselves to spiritual life, the life-giving spring of Christ's resurrection flows into us. His light illuminates our path, and we hunger and thirst for His presence. This is what we draw from the Lord—His power, which changes everything. Our perspective shifts: what once mattered fades, and what truly matters comes into focus.  

"Take up your cross and follow Me," the Lord commands. To take up the cross is to follow Christ to Golgotha, like a prisoner walking to execution. On this path, we no longer concern ourselves with resumes, pensions, appearances, or worldly influence. These things become secondary. What matters is staying on the path to Golgotha, not straying from the way of the cross.  

We also recall the time when Orthodox Christianity became prevalent under Emperor Constantine and Empress Helen. While this brought great opportunities for mission and the advancement of the Church, it also led to a decline in the general level of spirituality. When everyone becomes a Christian, not all are eager or sincere in their faith. Many become merely formal Christians. The most earnest believers of that era felt that living in cities polluted their attachment to the kingdom of heaven. They withdrew to the deserts to preserve their fervor and the flame of faith.  

While not everyone can retreat to the desert, we must understand the intuition behind their choice. Living in cities or anywhere in the world, we must remain loyal to Christ. We must guard against the spirit of routine, worldly interests, and the distractions of daily life. The desert fathers remind us that our true home is the kingdom of heaven, and our loyalty must always be to Christ, no matter where we live or what we face.  

Let us, therefore, strive to live as citizens of the kingdom of heaven, drawing strength from the resurrection of Christ. Let us take up our cross daily, following Him with unwavering devotion, and remain steadfast in our faith, even amidst the challenges of this world.

We must remain vigilant, guarding ourselves against being polluted by the spirit of this world, especially as we navigate the digital realms. The current trend is to draw people away from the tangible world into artificial, mystical, and phantom realities—digital worlds that are already ensnaring many through platforms like Facebook, TikTok, video games, and other distractions. People are increasingly withdrawn, physically present but mentally and emotionally absorbed in their devices. This detachment will only grow worse.  

Yet, as this former world fractures and a new, more anti-Christian world emerges, it also creates opportunities for Christian mission. While this is a topic for another time, it is worth noting that even in times of upheaval, the Gospel can find new avenues to reach hearts.  

However, we must resist the infernal process of descending into a godless existence, a life governed by demonic principles. In the digital world and virtual reality, we risk losing not only our connection to God but even our conscience. Instead, we must anchor ourselves in the kingdom of God, becoming children of light and resurrection. As Scripture teaches, the flesh produces death, but the Spirit brings life—a life that begins now, not after death. This must become our reality.  

Living in this reality also opens our spiritual eyes to discern the true enemy of Christ and the world. This truth is not found in newspapers or worldly narratives but revealed through communion with God. The Holy Fathers, whose spiritual eyes were opened, guide us, but unless we ourselves grow in spirituality, we cannot grasp spiritual truths. The world of God is a world of divine truth—not the measurable, objective truths of science, but the transcendent truth of the Lord, which surpasses logic and human language.  

May our Lord grant us the joy of Pascha, opening the portal to His kingdom and preserving us within it, even as we live in this world. May we belong to the kingdom of God, rooted in His truth and life. May this be so, amen.  

Christ is risen—indeed, He is risen!
