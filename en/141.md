# What is “standing” Is the Church conquered by the evil

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about standing or station. This is central to Christian life. Also, tonight, we will have a standing of Saint Mary of Egypt. This is a divine service that the Church holds on the fifth week of the Great Lent. It includes the whole canon of Saint Andrew of Crete, together with the life of Saint Mary of Egypt. We will read it, and we might wonder why it's called the standing of Saint Mary. Why Saint Mary? Why not some other saint? Is it called standing because it's a long prayer? Well, not because of that.

To understand this concept of standing, we go back to the earliest church history. There were station days, so-called station days, which were fasting days. On these days, the faithful would not eat—perhaps they drank a little, but they did not eat until at least 3 p.m., or better still, until 6 p.m. At that time, the end of the day was considered to be around 6 p.m. These station days were very important. From the earliest document, the Didache, which was written around the same time as the Gospels, we see that the Church kept fasts on Wednesdays and Fridays. Those were the station days.

During these days, there was a tremendous focus on prayer, Holy Scripture, spiritual life, and standing—a military term meaning to be on guard, to watch for any temptation, evil, delusion, or anything like that. This concept of standing comes from there. So, standing is actually fasting. It means to stand in the truth, to stand on guard against the enemy, not to be overthrown by him or injured by him. It means to stand on guard for your own soul, not to allow evil or false temptations to enter and defile or harm you. You need that standing. You need to learn what it is all about. We do this now during Lent because it serves as a model for us on how to keep Lent. I will say more about that in a moment.

Let us take a look at what the Apostle Paul says. He tells us that our fight is against spiritual evil powers, as written in Ephesians chapter 6. Let us read what he says about how to fight those evil powers. In verse 13, he says, "Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness. Stand, that you may overcome all the evil in that evil day, and stand." Stand through, remain standing all through. That is what it means.

What is this evil day? The Holy Fathers tell us that this refers to the earthly world. This world is full of deception, evil, temptations, and all kinds of wickedness. So, this is the evil day. Why is it called a day? It is called a day because it is short; it has its span. It won't last forever. Do you think it will be forever? No, it won't. The temptations you have to go through, all this spiritual warfare you have to face, is temporary. It will be over quite soon. This gives us great hope and motivation to endure.

Of course, you might face some truly evil day—a revolution, a war, or a significant attack by the devil. He prepares, prepares, prepares, and then he strikes. On that very day, you have to stand. You have to endure that hit, that invasion, that coup d'état he attempts to carry out to overtake you. So, we see this concept of standing from Saint Peter, how central and important it is. If we relax and take it easy, the old man inside us will wake up. In Holy Baptism, we participate in Christ's victory over the devil, and He causes our old man to die. But if we become complacent, thinking, "Now I am a Christian," the old man in you will wake up and harm you badly. To get rid of him, to mortify him, to crucify him, you need to stand on guard. You need to be standing. This is a military term.

And the Orthodox faith means standing in the truth. It is not merely about accepting some correct doctrine—saying, "I accept, I accept, and I am fine; I am Orthodox." No, *Orthodoxia*, the right belief and right worship of God, also means *orthopraxia*. *Orthopraxia* is right living, right deeds. As the Apostle Paul says, faith without works is dead. If you believe the right things but do nothing, it amounts to nothing; you are far from the truth. So, *orthopraxia* also means *orthostasia*—standing. You need to stand in the truth, in the right way. 

Standing is directly connected to remaining Orthodox. It is not enough to simply call yourself Orthodox, to be baptized Orthodox, or to formally belong to the Orthodox Church. That would not be *Orthodoxia*; it might be *ortho-calling*—calling yourself the right way, but it is just a name, which does not mean much. Or it might be like belonging to the right party. No, that is nothing. Well, it is better than nothing, but it is not enough. 

So, we must begin with ourselves. We should not accuse others but focus on becoming truly Orthodox Christians, standing in the truth. Today, we see that the Church, in some ways, is being pushed back on certain frontiers. On some frontiers, we are advancing; on others, we are losing ground. Spiritually speaking, the greatest danger comes from the loosening and relaxing of fasting, asceticism, and spiritual warfare. 

This is because we now have far fewer monastics than in the past. Many of the Church's activities—spiritual books, missions, and other works—have traditionally been carried out by monastics who dedicate their entire lives to these pursuits. But now, their numbers are dwindling, and their influence is weakening. Laypeople, too, are less active. Many are preoccupied with their own lives, earning money, and facing countless temptations and obligations in this world. They are often less serious about their faith, less eager to change, to stand firm in fasting, and to fight against evil. 

We also see that many aspects of the Church's media are overly influenced by worldly agendas, ideas, and ideologies. Why is this happening? We observe that political agendas are increasingly influencing the Church in various ways. Even among the hierarchy, there are pressures—financial and otherwise—that act like shackles. If you do not support certain initiatives, funding and resources may be withheld. This worldliness is creeping into the Church in subtle ways. 

When we see this, we must not react by saying, "Oh, I know these people; they are traitors, they are corrupt," and then distance ourselves from the Church. That would be the greatest mistake you could make. We believe in one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church—the Orthodox Church. We believe it is catholic (universal), not in the sense of the Roman Catholic Church, which took the name from us, but in the sense that the true catholic Church is the Orthodox Church. 

This Church, we believe, will exist forever, until the end of the ages. If you do not believe in it, you are not Orthodox—I am sorry to say. We must have faith that the Church is here and will endure long after we are gone. Our lives are fleeting, but the Church will remain. Even if, on some frontiers, the Church appears to be losing ground, we can still go into the territory of the enemy and strike from within. 

How? By being stronger soldiers of Christ, by relying on the Holy Fathers, and by adopting stricter ascetic practices in our own lives. We must stand firmer against evil than even some of our brothers and sisters. But this must be done with humility, relying solely on the grace of the Lord. It cannot be accomplished by our own will alone. 

Saint Mary of Egypt is a shining example of how our will, combined with God's grace, can transform us. She shows us how decisively we can fight the evil within us, how we can become holy, and how we can achieve great victories in the spiritual battle against evil. Let us follow her example, standing firm in the truth, living out our faith with deeds, and remaining steadfast in our Orthodox faith.

So we can do that—we can strike the enemy in his own territory. This is not like someone who refuses to defend their country, saying, "Oh, this government is corrupt, so I will help the enemy." That person is a traitor, not a hero or a wise individual. We must not be like that. Our homeland is the Holy Church, the kingdom of heaven that is present in this world. We are soldiers and citizens of this kingdom. 

As witnesses to Christ's love, we must grow stronger spiritually, learning from the examples of the saints. Let us set higher standards for ourselves, striving to do better, to achieve more, and to reach new spiritual heights. Now, as we approach the final part of the Great Lent, we must be especially vigilant. We should pray longer, read the Holy Scriptures more diligently, and follow Christ to Golgotha, maintaining a heightened spiritual vigilance even after Lent ends. We must not simply return to our old ways, relax, and allow the passions we have fought against to awaken and overtake us.

One final point I want to make is that for some people, life may seem long and aimless. They may not understand why they are in the Church. But the truth is, the Lord gives us time, especially when we are not yet standing firm. We may not yet have learned how to stand, how to fight, or what spiritual work truly means. Some might say, "Yes, I'm Orthodox. I go to church, I do this, I do that, but I don't really like fasting, and I don't really read the Bible. Still, I'm Orthodox." No, this is not enough. The Lord gives you more time to wake up. 

Now is the time to begin fighting against evil, to start standing in the truth, and to embark on your path to Golgotha, toward sanctity. This is the opportune moment. We must begin. Enter into this spiritual battle; otherwise, you will remain in that "evil day," asleep, blinded, relaxed, and overtaken by passions and self-delusion.

May the Lord grant us wisdom and strength. May He place us in this standing, giving us the fortitude to endure all the way through and to overcome the enemy with His help. And may Saint Mary of Egypt pray to God for us. God bless.
