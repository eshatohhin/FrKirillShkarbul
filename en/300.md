# Test of Faith and Foretaste of the Kingdom

Dear brothers and sisters, this past week was the Week of Veneration of the Holy Cross. It falls in the middle of Great Lent, when we are called to draw power from the Cross—the Life-Giving Cross.  

Yet we might wonder: What does it mean to draw power from the Cross without spiritual insight? We may understand it logically, but we don’t truly grasp it, appreciate it, or feel it. It doesn’t resonate deeply within us.  

Today, I want to discuss how to gain the spiritual power we so desperately need—how to strengthen our faith. Because if we take this journey of Great Lent seriously, striving to mortify our old selves, live for Christ, take up our crosses, and follow Him, we will quickly realize how weak we are. We stumble constantly. We may ask: How can I avoid this? How can I attain the great power and motivation the saints possessed? How do we bear the fruits of faith? Without this, our faith is hollow.  

Faith that doesn’t profoundly transform our lives and inner being is not true faith. It’s not mere intellectual assent to dogma. No, true faith is power—a mighty force.  

Today, I want to share some reflections on this power: how we draw it and what pitfalls to avoid. Often, we see people’s faith collapse like a shipwreck. Their entire spiritual pursuit unravels, ending in catastrophe. Some abandon the Church, even growing to despise everything related to Christ and God.  

This is what we call apostasy, and it happens for reasons. Frequently, people fail because they lack a solid spiritual foundation—a rock to lean on in times of trial. Instead, they build their faith on false supports, unstable foundations.  

For example, some might be deeply moved during their initial conversion—perhaps by visiting a monastery, witnessing the devout lives of its inhabitants, and feeling as though they’ve glimpsed the Kingdom of Heaven. But if their faith remains rooted solely in that experience, it will crumble. Eventually, they’ll see imperfections—flaws in the monastery or its people—and because their faith was built on human examples and fleeting emotions rather than the true Rock, it will collapse.  

The goal is to recognize that while such testimonies of faith are valuable, they are only stepping stones toward reliance on Christ Himself.  

Now, this is easier said than done. When we hear, “Trust Christ; He will save you; He is the Rock, the Fountain of Life,” we may nod in agreement, but in practice, this represents a high level of spirituality. Most of us—myself included—struggle to rely on Christ completely, to abide in Him unshaken through every trial, to live in constant union with Him. This is our aim, but often, we only catch fleeting glimpses of it. It’s not yet our daily reality.  

Yet this doesn’t mean we should settle for false foundations. There are other supports—which I’ll discuss—that can help steady us as we grow toward that ultimate reliance.  

Another cause of spiritual shipwreck is a distorted understanding of our relationship with God.  

I’ve witnessed this many times: faithful believers who were deeply pious, who attended church for years, participated in all the sacraments, and immersed themselves in the liturgy. Yet when a great trial struck their lives, they abandoned everything. Why? Because outwardly, they were devout—but inwardly, they had formed a kind of *contract* with God.  

They thought: *What am I supposed to do? Pray, receive Communion, read Scripture, avoid major sins, confess regularly—fine, I’ll do all that. But in return, God must hold up His end of the bargain. He must protect me, shield me from disaster, keep my loved ones safe, answer my prayers, maybe even grant me a good job.* People have different expectations, but the mindset is the same: *If I fulfill my duties, God owes me.* And when He doesn’t deliver as they imagined—when suffering comes—their faith shatters. They walk away.  

This is a dangerous trap, and it reveals a Cainite heart—one that bargains with God even beneath a veneer of piety. These are the pitfalls we must avoid.  

Ultimately, there are two great spiritual dangers. The first is *the love of the flesh*—greed, laziness, slavery to comfort. We grow spiritually sluggish and return to serving our appetites, whether for money, pleasure, or ease. The second is *pride*—arrogance that leads to heresy, or what I call *mind-worship*. We idolize our own intellect, convinced we’re wiser than the Church. This is the path of many Protestant sects, though certainly not theirs alone.  

So let’s say we genuinely strive to avoid these pitfalls. We pray honestly: *Lord, I am not here for mammon. I want to take up my cross and follow You as best I can. This is my goal—I am sincere. I don’t want to surrender to mammon or hedonism. I will fight my old self to the end. I want to learn humility. I want to remain faithful to the holy Tradition of the Church. I long to be among those You are preparing a place for in Your Kingdom. But how, Lord? I fail. I am weak. I am ignorant. How do I gain strength?*  

Even the Apostles pleaded: *Lord, increase our faith!* They, too, felt their faith was frail.  

In this struggle, let us turn to Christ’s own words. He repeatedly taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is of supreme value—that we must *seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness*, and all else will follow. We are to store up *treasures in Heaven*, making this our life’s highest aim. We understand this intellectually: *I am a citizen of Heaven. I must live for Heaven.* But how do we make this more than an idea? How do we make it our daily, unceasing reality?  

Consider an analogy: our earthly homeland. Imagine you are French (or from any nation), and you travel far—say, to China or India. The language, food, climate, and customs are utterly foreign. At first, it may feel like an adventure. But if you had to live there for years—or decades—you would ache for home. A compatriot’s voice, a familiar meal, a book in your native tongue, even a small souvenir would become precious. These things would strengthen you. And if you could visit home, even briefly, you would feel renewed—*at home* in the deepest sense.  

This is how we ought to feel toward our *true homeland*—the Heavenly Kingdom. We must cultivate a holy nostalgia for it, drawing strength from whatever connects us to it: the Divine Liturgy, Scripture, the lives of saints, or fellowship with faithful brothers and sisters. These are not ends in themselves, but means—like letters from home, reminding us where we truly belong.  

What sustains us may vary at different stages of our spiritual journey. For me, in the early days of my faith...  

In my early days as a neophyte—newly converted, naive yet burning with faith—I relied on certain pillars for spiritual strength. The Holy Gospels were my daily inspiration. I attended every Divine Service possible, immersing myself in the rhythm of worship. The lives of saints—all saints—nourished me, as did conversations with monks and my spiritual father, who guided my first conscious steps toward Christ. (Before this, my faith existed but lacked depth.) Daily prayer—morning and evening—anchored me, granting the patience and fortitude to face those initial challenges.  

That was over twenty years ago. Since then, this eager faith has weathered severe trials—crises that shook me to my core. In those moments of fracture, I sought restoration: a way to reclaim stability and power in Christ.  

In recent years, different spiritual resources have sustained me. The early martyrs’ testimonies, for instance, became profoundly moving. Unlike generalized saintly accounts, their stories reveal ordinary people—flawed like you and me—who chose, despite weakness, to endure torture and renounce this world for the next. Their witness still stirs me.  

For a season, daily Holy Communion became my lifeline—a physical union with Christ where I drew healing and strength. I prepared meticulously, approaching each Liturgy not as routine, but as the day’s defining event: a source of direction and grace. I learned, through practice, the Eucharist’s transformative power.  

The Desert Fathers, too, became exemplars. Their lives were a daily martyrdom—a refusal to let faith fade into mere ritual or moralism after the age of persecution ended. They kept the fire alive. Because Christianity is not about dogma alone; it is *life*—and that life must burn within us.  

These experiences I’ve described—the Divine Liturgy, the sayings of the saints, the Jesus Prayer, and the practice of hesychasm—have given me the profound sense of being *at home* in Christ. Whenever I immerse myself in these spiritual disciplines, I taste the Kingdom. In the Liturgy, I encounter the living Christ; in prayer, I enter into intimate communion with Him. Even when I first learned of the Jesus Prayer years ago, its true power—this sacred art of the heart’s dialogue with God—only became real to me through the crucible of life’s trials.  

This is the heart of the analogy: when we draw near to what is *of Heaven*, we awaken to our true homeland. That closeness ignites courage, clarity, and unshakable purpose. It steels us to face any challenge, for we know *where we belong*—and to Whom.  

To conclude, brothers and sisters, let me share a passage from Hebrews 13:7 (rendered more precisely here):  
*"Remember your leaders, those who spoke God’s word to you. Consider the outcome of their lives, and imitate their faith."*  

These "leaders" may be living mentors or saints now glorified—apostles, martyrs, ascetics—any whose lives radiate Christ’s love. Pay special attention to *how they ended their race*. For many, it was martyrdom; for others, a radiant departure, surrounded by disciples or leaving a legacy of monasteries. A Christian’s death is often God’s final seal on their *agon* (spiritual struggle)—a trophy revealing the authenticity of their lifelong pursuit.  

This *agon*—the sacred struggle of our earthly life—finds its ultimate seal in how we depart this world. Our death is a second birth, a passage into eternity. When we witness how the saints finished their race—whether in martyrdom, radiant holiness, or leaving a godly legacy—we see living proof that such faith is possible for us too.  

Let their lives ignite your daring. You *can* attain the same depth of faith, the same boldness, the same wisdom in Scripture. Dare to ask for it! The Lord may grant you even greater gifts. Their witness is your roadmap: trust in God’s guidance, walk in humility and repentance, yet burn with holy zeal for the Kingdom. Serve Christ fearlessly; love others as His hands and feet.  

May the Lord stir such courage in us all. May He teach us to draw power from His Cross, the Divine Liturgy, and the Jesus Prayer—until we live in unbroken reliance on Him. May our hearts gush with ceaseless prayer, and may we taste the joy of His presence at every moment.  

Guard us, O Lord, on this pilgrimage to the Heavenly Homeland. Shield us from deception, half-heartedness, and corruption. Make us true heirs of Your Kingdom, radiant with the joy of salvation.  

**Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters.**
