# Canshould we criticize the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, recently I have heard a lot of criticism of the church coming from the faithful, from the people who are in the church.  
And in these times, when we are facing the end of times, the struggle with the Antichrist is going to be quite fierce.  
We need to have a better understanding of our relationship with the church—what is the church?—and build this relationship in a way that we can withstand all the deceit and temptations coming from the times of the Antichrist.  
We cannot rely on someone out there. We need to rely only on the saints within the church. And every one of us is called to be such a saint.  
Because this is a spiritual struggle, and we need to be spiritually strong and ready to endure this struggle.  

To understand what the church is, we need to consider what it means that it is the body of Christ. Is it a mystical body of Christ that exists somewhere out there, while all of us are just people, just sinners?  
What about the hierarchy, the official church? Is the church just statistics? How many parishes do we have around the world? Is that the church?  
Or is the church the saints in the books? We read their lives. That’s the real church. But now we don’t have that. Maybe we hear about someone who is a saint, but they are somewhere in the forest, somewhere far away.  
Or is the church just me? Me and Christ—that’s enough. I don’t care about anything else.  
There are different ways of looking at what the church is and what our relationship with the church should be.  

To begin, I want to recall the words of Saint Cyprian of Carthage, who said that for whom the church is not his mother, God is not his father.  
So we need to enter into this relationship with the church, recognizing that it is our spiritual mother.  
We should not be foreign outsiders, thinking, "The church is out there. It’s those priests, those bishops, those patriarchs, and it’s me. I’m looking at it and criticizing this church."  
We should understand that we are her children. Whose children? That’s the question.  
Only in this sense, in this case, will we be children of God the Father. He will be our Father. We will truly be able to say, "Our Father."  
It won’t just be a prayer; it will be a reality.  

To understand this problem, we need to start with our perception of people and reality. There are two major problems we face in modern times.  
One problem is that we have a completely demystified mindset. There are no mysteries for us in this world.  
We look at everything as just objects—physical objects or legal entities. The church is a legal entity; it has its charter, its finances, and so on.  
That’s reality—financial, legal reality. But we don’t understand the church as a mystical organism.  
In the same way, we can look at our parents, our mother and father, as just people. They are just physical beings with their own selfish interests and legal rights.  
That’s it. Or we can have the understanding that it’s more than that. It’s my mother; it’s my father.  
In the past, people were much more receptive to such realities. For them, concepts like "homeland" meant something—something more than they mean for us now.  
For us now, it’s just customs. I need to fill out some forms. That’s "homeland security." I’m done with that.  
But it’s just a bunch of selfish people living in some territory. That’s it.  
For us, it’s less and less meaningful. I also call this the "hacked mind," the "hacked world."  
Because this is something that makes us unable to see what the church truly is.  

This is related to another problem we have. Another problem is that we are very self-confident.  
Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov says that this self-confidence, self-assurance, and the feeling that we understand everything and that we are very smart—  
this makes us miserable in the eyes of God. He does not tolerate, He does not like people like that.

People like that cannot be saved. But this is the spirit we feel from movies. We look at those actors, and they seem to know everything; they are very sure of themselves.  
This spirit is an adult spirit. Yet Christ speaks of children, saying that we must become like children.  
In Matthew 18:3, He says, "Truly I tell you, unless you repent and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."  
You need to repent; you need to turn away. Just as you turn away from idolatry, you leave it behind and turn to God. You turn away from lust, from idolatry. You cast it aside and turn to God.  
In the same way, you need to cast aside this self-assured spirit and become like children. What does it mean to be like a child?  
It’s not about being infantile or childish, like those "Hello Kitty" things. No. To be like a child means to be simple.  
To be without evil thoughts. To lack the curiosity that bad characters always have.  
No, children don’t have that. They don’t obsess over gossip or events that happened to someone else.  
To be more naive. To believe people. To be willing to learn everything.  
To have that mystical feeling about reality—that there are mysterious things in it.  
And to repent quickly. If children do something wrong, they repent quickly.  
Nowadays, children are quite corrupted from a very early age. They try to pretend and manipulate.  
So we are talking about normal children, not modern children.  

We need to become like that. And if we become like children, we will be able to have the church as our spiritual mother and God as our Father.  
We will see the mystical dimension of the church. We will discern where there is merely hierarchy and where there is this mystical reality.  
We will love this mystical reality and not constantly criticize the church as a whole.  
We need to become deeply united. We need to join the army.  
When you enter the army, you don’t criticize everyone, saying, "This is bad, that is wrong."  
No, there is a war going on. You take up your rifle, and you fight.  
If you fight well, you will win. The army will advance.  
If you constantly criticize, saying, "We don’t have this, we don’t have that, and the commanders are stupid," you will surely lose.  
There is no chance of victory. So we must enter into this army of Christ.  
We need to be ready and very demanding of ourselves, of each of us.  
We need to know for certain that the church provides the full grace that God can give us.  
It has not diminished. The Lord’s hand has not grown weak.  
It is we who are unwilling to receive the power of God into our lives.  
And that is why we become weak. Only then can we advance, spoil the plans of the Antichrist, and overthrow all the deceit that is coming into the world.  

If we are spiritual orphans, without a spiritual mother, we cannot bear spiritual fruit.  
We cannot build our small church, our family as a church, as a Christian family.  
We cannot even build the temple of our own soul. We cannot build because we are orphans.  
In the same way, when people are abandoned by their parents, they seldom build a decent family.  
It is very difficult. Similarly, if we are spiritual orphans, if we have not entered into this spiritual reality,  
if we lack this deep love and reliance on the church as our spiritual mother,  
then we will surely lose and bear no spiritual fruit.  

May the Lord help us, make us fruitful, strengthen us, and help us grow stronger in this world.  
Let us not judge others, not judge the hierarchy, but work together, pray for one another, and for the whole world.  
Let us overcome all evil and enter into the glory of Christ. May the Lord bless us.
