# How to perceive coronavirus

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will discuss how a Christian should respond to the coronavirus crisis and the ongoing pandemic. In general society, there are three basic types of reactions.

The first type is the belief that, while this is a crisis and things are bad, they will eventually improve. The vaccine will come, the government will take measures, and medicine will combat the virus. Humanity will overcome this challenge, and in a few months, a year, or even five years, everything will be fine and may even be better than before. This is one type of reaction.

The second type is more pessimistic. It holds that while things are bad now, they will get even worse. The government may have schemes to control and brainwash people, and perhaps the days of the Antichrist are approaching. This view suggests that we need to pray and prepare for even worse times. Although it may seem more realistic, it is still quite negative, and many churchgoers adopt this perspective.

The third reaction, held by a minority, is that while the situation is bad for most, it presents an opportunity for personal gain. Some people believe they can profit from others' suffering, finding business opportunities to improve their own lives, even as others suffer. This reaction is the worst, as it lacks compassion and is deeply selfish. It is not the mindset of good, moral people.

So, how should we, as Christians and as a church, respond? Our reaction should be as follows: Yes, things are bad. We always pray for peace, for the absence of war, disease, and disaster. The church prays for these things. However, even in difficult times, there is potential for good. We can find spiritual opportunities in this situation.

The coronavirus, while it brings suffering and disrupts our lives, can be seen as a tool of the devil, allowed by God. It hinders our missions and causes pain, but it also calls us to spiritual battle. This struggle can make us stronger, more spiritually developed, and more advanced as we face and overcome the temptations that come with this crisis.

In Christianity, we often encounter seemingly contradictory ideas. We mourn the loss of a loved one, yet we also celebrate their reunion with the Lord and the promise of resurrection. Sorrow and joy coexist. Similarly, we pray for peace and the absence of war, yet we prepare for spiritual warfare, studying the writings of the holy fathers on how to be better soldiers for Christ. These dualities are part of our faith.

As long as we remain with Christ, we can navigate these complexities without losing sight of the truth. The current times can be compared to the era of the early Christians in some ways. Let us draw inspiration from their resilience and faith as we face our own challenges.

During the persecutions of the early church, which were also orchestrated by the devil, the emperors who harmed the church and sought to destroy Christians were often referred to as Antichrists. These rulers attempted to prevent the spread of the Gospel and eliminate the faithful. The church did not celebrate these persecutions, yet it was during these times that many Christians attained the crown of martyrdom. Countless saints emerged from these trials, glorifying God through their suffering, steadfast faith, and ultimate sacrifice. These persecutions, though terrible, provided an opportunity for spiritual growth and the glorification of God.

When the persecutions ceased, some Christians and holy fathers lamented, "Where are those times when we could prove our faith? Now those opportunities are gone." While there were still ways to glorify God, the nature of the struggle had changed. The persecutions had provided a unique opportunity for spiritual heroism, and many drew joy and spiritual benefit from enduring such trials.

In a similar way, the coronavirus pandemic presents us with an opportunity for spiritual growth. Through this crisis, we are called to fight, to withstand temptations, and to grow stronger in our faith. A person can exist in one of three ways. First, they can simply go with the flow, living a spiritually relaxed life, indulging in comfort, and gradually becoming spiritually lethargic, unhealthy, and weak. Second, they can engage in spiritual training, becoming stronger and more disciplined, though not necessarily achieving heroic feats. However, when war comes—whether literal or spiritual—even those who were not previously trained can rise to the occasion. Some become heroes, making great contributions that are remembered in history. War, though undesirable, often brings out strength, wisdom, and resilience in those who endure it. Of course, many are also broken by such trials, but for those who remain steadfast, it offers a chance for profound spiritual growth.

We did not ask for this pandemic, just as no one prays for war. Yet, since it is here, we must use it to our spiritual advantage. This is a war against Satan, and we now see the entire world being influenced by this satanic force through the coronavirus. In this situation, we have the opportunity to grow stronger in prayer, fasting, spiritual reading, and the study of the Gospel. We are called to witness to the Christian message of salvation and to help others do the same.

This perspective may seem paradoxical—something bad can also be good—but in Christianity, such contradictions are common. We must not rely solely on human logic but embrace the spiritual truths that transcend it. Let us strive to be spiritually healthy, avoiding laziness and spiritual sickness. By doing so, we can overcome these challenges, grow stronger, and receive rewards from the Lord that we might not have attained otherwise.

May the Lord grant each of us the strength and eagerness to face this spiritual battle with faith and courage. Amen.
