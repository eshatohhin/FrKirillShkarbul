# Mission to Huahine Island

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am on another island in French Polynesia called Huahine Island. This island is not too far from the main island of Tahiti—it's about four hours by ship. I arrived here yesterday by ship, and today I want to share with you why I came here, what I’ve seen on this island, and some thoughts about preaching, the mission here, and the people. 

This place is not too far from Tahiti, but it’s far enough to limit the number of tourists. The population here is only about 6,000 people, the majority of whom are locals. There are some foreigners, but not many, and while there are tourists, it’s not crowded at all. You see them here and there, but there’s no town or city—it’s quite small, more like a village. You can hear the sounds of dogs, chickens, and everything else here. 

I decided to come here because I met someone from Bora Bora, which is not far from here. He told me about the ship and these islands, describing them as very beautiful and quiet. He also mentioned that it’s not difficult to get here—just take a boat, which is not as expensive as flying. The ferry is right next to where I live in Papeete, Tahiti. Since Sundays and Mondays are quiet in Papeete, with nothing open and not many people around, I thought it would be a good opportunity to come here and explore potential mission opportunities. 

I also see this trip as more of a preparation for future visits. I don’t expect massive conversions to happen right away on the first trip. Instead, I’m trying to understand different parts of the country and the various types of islands. Huahine is somewhere in the middle between Tahiti, which is crowded, modern, and fast-paced, and Toubouai, which I’ve talked about in previous videos. Toubouai is very different—it has very few people, everyone knows each other like one big family, and there are no tourists. It feels cut off from Tahiti and the rest of the world. When people took a plane in Toubouai, it was a big event—the whole village would come to say goodbye, reminiscent of old times when someone would leave town by train, and everyone would gather to bid farewell with tears. 

Now, I’m here in Huahine, which is somewhere in between. It’s much more peaceful and quiet, with far fewer people and tourists compared to Tahiti. Yet, it’s not too far—just a four-hour boat ride away.

So I decided to check it out, talk to people here, meet them, and share with them about the mission. That’s what I was doing all day yesterday, and I’ll continue doing it today—it’s still early morning now. 

What are my impressions? I’ve noticed that people here are more open and willing to talk compared to those in Tahiti. They’re not in a rush; every day here feels the same, and people have time. They value the connections they make, and it’s important to them that they’ve met someone and had a conversation. This makes it easier to engage with them for the mission. However, the influence of modern civilization is also evident here, and not in a positive way. 

For example, I’ve observed that people are curious about who I am, why I’m dressed the way I am, and what I have to say. But modern life has them constantly on the move—often in cars, driving from one place to another. They might notice me and wonder, “Who is this? What is he doing here?” but they’re already in a car, rushing somewhere. It’s not like the old days in a village, where people would stop and talk to you. Here, they’re already on the go, moving from point A to point B. That’s the modern world for you. Of course, some who are genuinely interested might stop and talk, but most won’t tell the driver, “Stop, let’s change our plans and talk to this person instead of going to the shopping center.” It’s difficult, and it shows how the modern world limits and separates people from one another. 

Another thing I discussed with someone yesterday—a granddaughter of a queen from these islands—was how life here has changed over the last 30 to 50 years. There’s a royal family here called Tamatua, and many people on the island are related to this family. She showed me a photo and shared her story, but she’s very humble, saying, “We are royalty, but we’re just simple people. I am just me, nothing more.” She spoke about how life here has transformed. When she was young, people shared everything with their neighbors and friends. If someone caught 10 fish, they’d give them to 10 people, and others would share bananas or something else. They lived like one big family—open, friendly, and supportive. But now, 30 to 40 years later, everything has changed. The world has become materialistic and selfish. People don’t trust each other, avoid communication, and focus only on business. There’s no trust or cohesion anymore. 

This anti-Christian development isn’t unique to this place—it’s happening all over the world. But here, the change is more evident and dramatic compared to, say, Europe or other parts of the world, where it might be more gradual. She also shared that, in their eyes, the people responsible for this shift are the Europeans—the white people who came here, many of whom were missionaries like me. They brought a new faith, converted people to Christianity in a broad sense, and now the world has changed in this way. As a result, there’s not much trust or openness toward new missionaries who come with a different message, like me. This is very sad, and it makes me feel that our mission shouldn’t focus on persuading people that “this is wrong, and this is right” or debating which dogmas are false or correct. That’s not the main point.

It is important that people can find a new source of true life for their souls in the Orthodox Church—that they can experience and receive the message of Christ, the love of Christ. Our goal is not simply to convert people, as if to say, “You have to become this, and now I’ve done my job and I’ll leave.” As missionaries, we must witness this love and teach by our example, by our lives. We must show what life in Christ truly means—a new attitude toward others that goes even beyond the friendly, communal society they once had here fifty years ago. This life in Christ offers even more: their hearts will become temples of the living God, their attitudes toward others will change, their lives will be transformed, and their values will shift. This is reality, not just nice words. 

Of course, we must ask ourselves: Do we, as priests and missionaries, live like this? Are we ourselves better than the kind people who used to share everything with each other here? As Christians, we are supposed to be even more than this—more friendly, more open, less selfish. But if we’re honest, most of us are not like this. So, if we want the mission to succeed—whether here or anywhere else, in our neighborhoods, with our relatives, or in any context—we must begin with ourselves. Only when we truly put on Christ (for whoever is baptized into Christ has put on Christ) and follow the narrow path of taking up our cross and following Him, only then is there a chance that others will also be willing to take up their cross and follow Christ. That is the true success of the mission—not having many buildings or resources. The Mormons, for example, have hundreds of buildings and tons of money, but that’s not what it’s about. It’s about the true fire of faith burning in people’s hearts, transforming them from within, making them true temples of the living God, united in the one body of Christ, the Holy Church. 

These are my thoughts, and I ask for your prayers for the mission here. I hope that each of us can allow these changes to take place in our hearts, and with the Lord’s help, we can do this. We also need to understand that there’s a stark difference between what the world brings and what the Church offers. Many white people come here and bring something, but behind some of it is the devil and Satan—postmodernism, sects, and all kinds of pseudo-culture, a fake and destructive culture that the wider world is importing here. But the Church of Jesus Christ, the true Church, the body of Christ, the messenger of love and the true gate to salvation, is so different. Let us remain faithful to the Lord, let us be children of His kingdom, and let us share His kingdom, His message, and His love with everyone around us. Please pray for this mission. May God bless every one of you.
