# Coming back to Sri Lanka to develop the Mission

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Pentecost!  
The Holy Apostles received the power of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost to preach the Gospel to all nations.  
Some of them stayed in Jerusalem, while others went to other countries. Eventually, all of them fulfilled their apostolic mission, preaching to both Gentiles and Jews, and were crucified.  
They were killed, martyred—all except the Apostle John.  
For an Orthodox priest or missionary, there is no higher blessing than to engage in mission work during these holy days following Pentecost.  
This year, the Lord has granted me the gift, glory be to Him, to return to Sri Lanka, this blessed and beautiful country, to preach the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
If you recall, I was here last November, seven months ago, when 33 people were baptized in the ocean.  
Since then, the mission has grown, faced challenges, and developed. Today, I want to share a little about what is happening.  
I arrived last night, and today I will travel to the center of the island, to our community in the city of Kurunagala, where we will visit the believers.  
We will conduct baptisms, as another 15 members have been prepared for Holy Baptism—a great achievement.  
Additionally, I aim to deliver goods and food to those in need.  
This visit is a blessing from the Department of Foreign Missions of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has a sponsor willing to help Sri Lankans in need following the recent crises.  
Last year, the country faced political and economic crises, which are not yet over. There were riots, shutdowns, and shortages of supplies, including energy and gas, limited to 20 liters per week with a QR code system.  
I am unsure if this is still the case, but it caused immense hardship, with many losing jobs, facing hunger, and enduring social tension that nearly escalated into civil war.  
I will assess the current situation, having just arrived, and distribute food and goods to people in various villages as part of my agenda.  
Another goal is to meet pastors and community leaders in different towns who are interested in the Orthodox faith.  
We will travel to the south of the island, to a place called Kol, to meet communities there, as well as to Urugambala and Anamadua, both near Kurunagala.  
This time, a retired government officer approached the Orthodox Church, contacting Moscow to learn more and seek baptism. He was referred to me and is arriving shortly.  
I am currently awaiting his arrival, and we will meet to discuss his interest. Hopefully, he will join our mission.  
He is influential, serving as a director at a major multinational company, and may bring more people to the Church in the future.  
We also face challenges. A significant disadvantage is the lack of support for the Orthodox mission in Sri Lanka from Orthodox or non-Orthodox countries.  
During my previous visit, we met Pastor Gratia, who leads communities in northern Sri Lanka that expressed interest in becoming Orthodox.

It is the area where Tamils live. I don’t know if you’re familiar, but they are another ethnic group with their own language, Tamil, and their own religion. They are predominantly Hindu, unlike here, where Buddhism is the majority religion. Most Sri Lankans are Sinhala, an ethnic and linguistic group that is mainly Buddhist. In the north, the Tamils are Hindus, and they are distinct—they look different, have a different culture, and live in the Tamil-majority region. We were really hoping to develop a mission there as well. However, Pastor Gratia, seeing a lack of care and support from the Mother Church, joined another church. He joined the Malankara Church, which is a monophysite, heretical church that adheres to the heresy of monophysitism, which spread to Syria and later to India. Now based in India, they are expanding their presence in Sri Lanka through this union with Pastor Gratia. He was ordained a deacon but is still considering joining the Orthodox Church. I hope he can figure it out. The Malankara Church calls itself Orthodox, but it is not. This creates confusion for many people, who might think that Coptic, Malankara, and Ethiopian churches are Orthodox, but they are not. Hopefully, Pastor Gratia will recognize this issue and join the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Orthodox Church.  

That’s all I wanted to share with you today. I will keep you updated on this mission. Please pray for Sri Lanka and its wonderful people, that the Lord may enlighten them with the light of truth and grant success to the Orthodox mission. May many enter into the body of Christ, attain true salvation, and glorify the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, now and forever, unto the ages of ages.  

Merry Pentecost, brothers and sisters! Reflect on your own calling. If you feel called to join the mission—whether in Sri Lanka, your own country, or even within your family—remember that you don’t have to become a great missionary. Simply sharing Christ’s love, the Holy Spirit that unites us with Him, and carrying that love to those around you is a profound act of ministry. May the Lord grant you the gift of the Holy Spirit, guide you in your life, and direct your ministry to His glory. Amen. God bless.
