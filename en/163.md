# Zombie apocalypse has begun.. how we fall victims of some “narratives”

Dear brothers and sisters, tomorrow we will celebrate the memory of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers: Tsar Nicholas, Tsarina Alexandra, the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia, and their son, Prince Alexei. Why were they killed? And why were they canonized by the Church? These are very important questions. I truly hope that everyone can learn more about the Royal Family and what happened during that time. I will make a video about them, but it would be helpful if you have some background knowledge and learn more about the events that unfolded.

Today, I simply want to highlight that they faced the power of evil. The Prince of this world blinded Russian society at that time, and even evil forces from around the world contributed to the rise of the Bolsheviks, Lenin, and everything that followed. At that time, there was a significant movement that ultimately led to the establishment of a proletarian and socialist state, despite its foundation in atheism. This was one of the major myths and narratives that blinded people, leading them to reject faith and God and destroy everything in their path.

Humble Christians, Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra, took up the chalice of sorrow and pain. They faced their cross and were martyred on their Golgotha. This was the true Christian way—not cooperating with evil, not trying to escape or flee from it, but following the path the Lord had given them to the very end, entering into His glory. For us, their martyrdom is not a tragedy but a triumph—the day of their celebration with the Lord and the victory of their lives.

Today, I will discuss what we are facing now, because the Prince of this world has become even more powerful. It may seem that the Gulags, concentration camps, Stalin, and the cruelty of that era were far more dangerous and evil compared to what we face today. Some might think that everything is fine now, that the 21st century is humane, and that such atrocities could never happen again. This is nonsense. The brainwashing happening today is far more thorough than it was back then. It is manipulation and deceit orchestrated by the devil, and it is much stronger and more powerful.

We now live in a world that has gone mad, thinking it is wise. It has become blind, manipulated, and deluded into believing it is free. This is quite strange. People think they are free and enlightened, but we must remember the Lord's words: "If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" We might believe we are intelligent, making our own decisions, and exercising our human rights, but in reality, we are not.

We can see that society and different countries are divided into segments, each brainwashed in a specific way. All of this is controlled within a larger system, and we have become like puppets in a grand game, like a swarm of flies moving this way or that, depending on which segment we belong to. To illustrate my point, consider the people around you who talk about the same things. You can often tell where they get their information—whether from liberal news, conservative news, or certain YouTube bloggers who promote similar ideas. Are they pro-American, pro-Putin, or something else? You can predict their mindset and worldview with precision.

If you tell them that you do not align with any particular position but have your own perspective, they will see you as a threat. You do not fit into their categories—friend or foe. You disrupt their entire worldview, and to them, you must cease to exist. You must disappear because you challenge their rosy picture of reality.

And if you find yourself in such a group—where you share similar ideas with a large number of people and are strongly "pro" something, whether it's pro-green, pro-this, or pro-that (I won’t delve too deeply into political specifics here)—it means your mind and soul have already been hacked. It doesn’t matter what your religion is, how much time you spend in church, how many books you’ve read, or whether you’re educated or not. None of that matters. You are already part of the system, part of that vast zombie apocalypse.

So why is this happening, and what can we do about it? Some people believe the world has never changed, that everything remains the same, and that humans are fundamentally unchanged. They argue that the Antichrist has always been present, from ancient times, deceiving humanity. While there is some truth to this, it is only partial. We can see that there has been significant development over time. Even if we look at politics, for example, there have been various empires throughout history—the Roman Empire, the Chinese Empire, the Mongol Empire—but there has never been a global empire like the United States. This only became a reality around the mid-20th century. Before that, even the British Empire did not control the entire world; it didn’t even dominate Europe, let alone countries like Russia. The United States, as a dominant global power, is now seeing its influence wane, but something else is emerging to take its place. And that "something" could very well be the empire of the Antichrist. If we allow this to happen, if we become part of the herd rushing toward the cliff, we will contribute to the rise of that kingdom—the kingdom of the Antichrist.

Why is this happening? It’s because our time is different. While the underlying principles may remain the same, the scale and methods have evolved to a new level. First, the technologies for manipulating human consciousness are more advanced than ever before. Never in history has there been such sophisticated manipulation. They know how to sell you ideas, convincing you that you need something in your life. They control human consciousness through media, search engines, and gadgets. This dependence on technology is staggering. For example, I sometimes send a message and receive an immediate response, which means the person is constantly glued to their device, living in that digital world of chats, Facebook, and other platforms. They are always connected, always reading, always reacting. This is not occasional; it’s constant. It means they are already deeply embedded in that virtual reality, which matters more to them than the real world around them. This is dependence. This is being hacked.

We must break free from this dependence. Additionally, humanity is now more psychologically vulnerable than ever before. We know that people often join sects or fall under total control when they are vulnerable—perhaps going through a personal crisis, like marital problems. Something similar is happening on a global scale today. Depression, fear, loneliness, anxiety, and other psychological issues are rampant. For example, Belgium sold more psychotropic drugs for depression, anxiety, and stress last year than at any other time in its history. The numbers are staggering, and if you look at the statistics, you’ll see how alarming the situation is.

During this time, people are not only being brainwashed and controlled; their negative energy is also being channeled toward an enemy. This is how the system operates: it creates division, fuels hatred, and directs people’s frustrations toward a common target. We must recognize this manipulation and resist it. We must reclaim our minds, our souls, and our freedom. Otherwise, we risk becoming willing participants in the rise of a new, darker empire.

You will be told that all the problems stem from anti-vaxxers, or from Putin, or some other scapegoat. You will be told that these are the reasons why life is so difficult, why anxiety is so pervasive. We are united against a common enemy, they say. On one side, people will blame the West or the United States, believing them to be the greatest threat. On the other side, people will point fingers at Putin or other figures. They will buy into these narratives because they are designed to be convincing.

This is not new. We saw something similar during the Cold War, as George Orwell described in his concept of the "Two Minutes Hate." It’s a moment when people are filled with adrenaline and a perverse joy in hating a common enemy. "That’s the bad guy," they think. "We hate him." This hatred becomes like a drug, blinding people and turning them into a mindless force. They become consumed by it, ready to destroy whoever they’ve been told is the enemy. Whether it’s the proletariat, the Bolsheviks, or some other group, the pattern is the same: identify the enemy, stoke hatred, and channel that energy toward destruction.

Similar dynamics are at play today, but they are far worse. People are weaker now—psychologically, spiritually, and emotionally. They are also more disconnected from their roots. There is no culture, no tradition, no adherence to commandments. Even those who consider themselves Christians often ignore the teachings of their faith. They do whatever the manipulators tell them to do, believing it will save them. Morality and religion are cast aside in favor of following orders. It doesn’t matter if you’re nominally Muslim, Christian, or anything else—what matters is compliance.

Another factor is that every segment of society is now manipulated. People are hypnotized by music, media, and other forms of influence. This level of control was impossible in the past, but today it is a reality. Additionally, the lines between good and evil have become blurred. In the past, there were clear distinctions: the police fought against the mafia, and ordinary citizens could rely on the police for protection. Now, everything is mixed together. It’s all about money and power, and it’s hard to know whom to trust.

Religions, too, have become intermixed. People no longer care deeply about their faith. Whether you’re Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, or Orthodox, it’s often treated as a nominal identity rather than a deeply held belief. This leads to a merging of religions, where people say, "Oh, it’s all the same. Let’s just have pizza together." Faith becomes irrelevant because people don’t study, pray, or truly believe. It’s just a label.

Even political ideologies have become muddled. Liberals and conservatives are no longer distinct. Liberals, in the name of human rights, are adopting totalitarian methods to control people, all while presenting themselves as democrats. The world has gone mad. As the Gospel warns, the end times will come like a net, covering everything and everyone. We are living in that time now. It’s not just one group or another that’s brainwashed—everyone is. 

We must be ready for this reality. The world we live in is chaotic, manipulated, and increasingly devoid of truth. The only way to resist is to reclaim our minds, our faith, and our humanity. Otherwise, we risk being swept away in the tide of deception and destruction.

We now see even clergy—those who are supposed to be guides and pastors for others—falling victim to subtle, soft propaganda. Often, people don’t even realize it’s propaganda, and that’s what makes it so dangerous. In the past, propaganda was more overt. Governments or political parties, like the Communists, openly declared their agendas. They would say, "We are materialists, we are atheists, and we will destroy the Church." Today, however, the approach is different. They say, "Everything is fine. We tolerate all religions." But beneath this veneer of openness and freedom lies a much more insidious reality.

You might feel that everything is open and free, that there’s no pressure, but then suddenly you find yourself thrown into a war, or you die from a virus, or you simply disappear because you didn’t comply with the agenda. If you don’t fit into the system, you are discarded. This is the work of the Antichrist. As the Lord said, the Antichrist is like a lion, prowling and seeking to devour those who are chosen—those who have decided to follow Christ and seek the Kingdom of Heaven. The Antichrist’s goal is to snatch them away, to kill them, and to deprive them of salvation.

For most people, this isn’t a threat because they are already manipulated—through money, vainglory, sin, or other means. They are not free, and they are not on the path to salvation. But for those who have chosen to follow Christ, the Antichrist seeks to pull them away from that path and lead them to destruction. This is why we must wake up—every one of us. We must help those around us wake up as well. Look at your family, your friends. They are already victims of the leviathan, the great machine of manipulation that controls through fear and deception. Pray for them. Talk to them. Help them see the truth.

We must not contribute to this machine. It has its own logic, but we can resist it. We can make it stumble, make it break. It’s not easy for the Antichrist to achieve his goals. We, on the other hand, are building the Kingdom of Heaven. We bear witness to it. Our hearts must be free of anger, hatred, and impurity. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. We must guard our hearts and souls against sin and defilement. We must have no hatred, only love, prayer, and compassion for others. This is what will keep us safe.

We may not become great saints or achieve extraordinary works of faith, but at the very least, we can refuse to participate in the work of the Antichrist. We can resist his project. Let us pray to the Lord and be serious about our hearts and souls. Let us be attentive and on guard. We should fear nothing except sin. Our only concern should be to avoid distancing ourselves from God or betraying Him through our actions and choices. No matter what happens in this world or society, we will not be afraid. We will stand as soldiers and witnesses of Christ, just as the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers did. They are a great example for us, and we are surrounded by a great cloud of saints who have walked this path before us.

Let us not place too much trust in people, not even in church leaders or speakers. Sometimes, even they can be brainwashed. Do not be afraid if you don’t see anyone around you speaking the truth. Stand firm in your faith, and let your life be a testimony to the Kingdom of Heaven.

If you find yourself alone, do not worry, for Christ is with you. As soon as we open our hearts to Him, He will be with us. His wisdom, His courage, and His strength will guide and sustain us. Amen. God bless. Amen.
