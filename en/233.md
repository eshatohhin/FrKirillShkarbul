# The Nativity of Christ will be followed by the butchering of the children.

Dear brothers and sisters, now is Advent, and we are approaching the Nativity of Christ. It is very important to think deeply about its meaning—what it means, what to expect, and how to prepare. In our commercialized society, this time of year often feels similar to other occasions. For example, we have Halloween, where everything is sold for that holiday, then everything changes to Christmas items, and later, something else. It seems like just another special occasion, a season of greetings, where people sometimes avoid even saying "Christmas." For many, it feels similar to New Year’s—a time of holidays, feasting, going to restaurants, exchanging gifts, enjoying music, and decorating.

But we must remember that the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness is growing worse. We should not have a rosy feeling that the Lord brings only peace and everything is romantic and nice. He said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword." Not that He wants people to fight, but He desires the truth to manifest itself. Truth and righteousness are things people often resist. Many prefer to remain in darkness, hypnotized, asleep, living in a dream, a fake reality. If you don’t believe me, try to pray. When you pray, you might feel sleepy or distracted by thoughts of other "more important" things, telling yourself, "I’ll pray later." This reveals our darkness—it shows we are still asleep, far from awakening our hearts to serve the Lord.

We must not fool ourselves. It is not enough to be baptized; we are still very much servants of the flesh and mammon. Let us be honest with ourselves. When the truth comes, it troubles us. Remember how Jerusalem was troubled, and King Herod was troubled. He ordered the killing of 14,000 babies and would have killed anyone to preserve his power. He would have dropped an atomic bomb or done anything to maintain the system of delusion, the system of exploitation, the mammonic system built on fake realities, cheating others, depriving them of their rights and dignity. That is why all of Jerusalem was troubled. That is why the people of Gennesaret did not want to receive Jesus—they wanted their pigs, their comfortable lives, and their income. They did not want to risk losing these things.

We, too, do not want to risk our comfort. We fear losing our jobs, even if they involve sin, or facing consequences because the Lord disapproves of our actions. We do not want to think about this, and neither do most people. This is the greatest concern: we fail to penetrate the deep spiritual reality of Christ’s coming.

Now, let us consider the expectations of people in those days and what is happening now. There are many similarities. In those days, people were expecting a savior. Today, some still await the Messiah, believing the world is in exile and alienation, and that the Messiah must come to build a temple and restore order.

But other nations, especially those who may call themselves Christians but are only nominal Christians, do not care about following Christ. Instead, they wait for a new world order—whether through technology, figures like Elon Musk, artificial intelligence, a superpower, or a reformed United Nations—to solve all our problems: wars, community crises, technological uncertainties, poverty, climate risks, and many other issues. The world is going crazy, and people believe someone or something must come to save it. Only a very few, those truly loyal to Christ, do not expect significant improvement in this world before the second coming of Christ. In fact, we are preparing for something much worse: the rise of the Antichrist and his kingdom, accompanied by great tribulation and persecution of the Church. This is what we must ready ourselves for. We may be like the children Herod sought to kill in his search for Christ. We must be prepared for Golgotha.

These thoughts are especially relevant today as we see many innocent people being killed, and next year likely even more, all due to someone’s ambitions, their service to Mammon and the Antichrist. Even some within the Church are complicit. Yet, we must not be discouraged. We must remain loyal to Christ, united with His Holy Church through prayer, the Holy Eucharist, and the spiritual traditions of the Holy Fathers. This is what will keep us afloat and in the light.

Now, let us consider the similarities and differences between humanity then and now. The similarities are numerous. Globalization existed even then, with the Roman Empire facilitating it through transport, international trade, and a highly efficient postal system. Such levels of communication and trade were unprecedented in ancient times and would not be seen again for over a thousand years, until modernity. Similarly, today we have economic colonization—though not called by that name—where weaker countries are subdued economically and politically. Nationalistic wars, which caused countless deaths for nothing but ambition or profit, were prevalent then and continue now, often serving the Antichrist’s agenda.

In those days, millions died in wars of conquest, and people fought in holy wars in Judea. Today, similar conflicts persist, and the situation is worsening. Technology also advanced rapidly then, with innovations like sewage systems and mechanical inventions, much like the rapid scientific and technological progress we see today. People then, as now, became reliant on technology. Currency and economic systems developed swiftly, and languages were unified, with much of the world speaking Latin or Greek. Similarly, new religions emerged, just as they do today.

And the same is true now. We have many new religions today, along with syncretism—the blending of different religions to create something seemingly new, much like ecumenism, which also occurred in those days. We also have mystical religions now, just as they did back then. People were obsessed with Kabbalah, esoteric beliefs, theosophy, and other mystical practices, which were very popular then and remain so today. Additionally, moral problems were rampant in those days, both among ordinary people and the elite, including the emperors, whose behavior was often perverse and corrupt. Similarly, today, these issues persist but are even worse.

In those days, everyone was waiting for a Messiah or Savior. Even in distant places like China, people anticipated a figure like Tsim Shih Hwa, who united the country and brought peace. This expectation was widespread, as people were obsessed with money, and everything was bought and sold. The Roman Empire saw a decline in nobility, culture, and philosophy, with no great new thinkers emerging. Today, philosophy has reached a similar endpoint, with post-modernism and post-post-modernism leaving people uncertain about what comes next. Interest in philosophy has waned, mirroring the degradation of those times.

Despite these similarities, there is a significant difference between then and now. In those days, all the troubles and problems stemmed from slavery—enslavement to Mammon—and people lacked access to the truth and the source of salvation. However, the Lord came to humanity because He saw potential. He saw that they were not yet completely destroyed and that some would repent, embrace Him, and continue His mission. He came humbly, teaching repentance, compassion, and humility, showing that these virtues could overcome Mammon and the delusions of the devil.

This victory is available to us today. It is what the Apostle Paul calls the "mystery of godliness." In 1 Timothy 3:16, he writes, "Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." The coming of Christ, which we now prepare to celebrate, is this mystery of godliness. We are all part of it, witnesses to it, even as darkness and evil persist as part of the "mystery of lawlessness" that Paul also speaks of.

This great conspiracy of the devil against humanity must be overthrown. We should not fear any darkness, for we have been given the ultimate weapon of victory: the Holy Cross and the Holy Communion. Through the Holy Cross, we trample the devil and all his darkness.

And all of this comes with the coming of Christ on earth. This is what we celebrate. This is what we are preparing for. We are ready to embrace our own cross and carry it, no matter how difficult it may become or what challenges lie ahead. Let us remain strong, faithful, and loyal to Christ, not misled by superficial celebrations or the allure of this world. While we hold great love for the people in this world, we must not unite with its spirit, its fakeness, its comforts, or its passions. Instead, we detach ourselves from these things and attach ourselves to Christ. Amen. God bless.
