# Individualism is a crowd thinking

Dear friends, today I want to say a few words about individualism and conformism.  
Very often, we think that we are now very individualistic, that this world is very individualistic, very free, and very democratic.  
But eventually, we will see that this individualism becomes the same thing as crowd thinking, mass thinking.  
And this is why mass media is called mass media. It's just a mass—a mass of stuff—and people become part of this mass.  
If you don't want to become part of this mass, the true way is not to constantly prove that you are different through individualism. No.  
The true way not to become part of the mass is to be with Christ. This is the only way to have Christ awaken you and give you His own thinking and mindset.  

We saw this in Christ's time. There was a crowd following Him, and this crowd sometimes supported Him, such as when He entered Jerusalem.  
Then, all of a sudden, they were saying, "Crucify Him!" So, this crowd—Christ Himself even said, "How long must I endure this?"  
Because they always want something for themselves; they are only looking for some gain, some benefit.  
And this is the majority of people, and unfortunately, people become part of the crowd.  
We will discover that we ourselves are part of the crowd very often in many respects.  
For example, if we watch TV too much, we get our ideas from the news and our worldview from the news media. Then, we will become part of the crowd.  
We will adopt certain ideas and think they are our own, but in fact, we will just be part of the crowd.  

However, if we decide, "No, I don't want that," and now many young people watch the internet, YouTube, and don't watch TV, doing their own research instead,  
you might say, "Well, these guys are not part of the mass; they are very free and individualistic."  
But in fact, our time has become even more mass-oriented than it used to be.  
Because now, people join social networks, and the main mindset becomes narcissism.  
People enjoy how they look; they take photos of themselves, they post stories about what they do at every step.  
And they become completely closed off in their own little world.  
They might think they are very free, but all of that is directed by the old self—the fallen nature of man.  
Even in marginal cultures, like hippies or certain rock groups, those marginal people also become all the same, very similar.  
Even though they have different tattoos or hairstyles, it's all the same spirit, the same mindset. Why?  
Because if we are not with Christ, we will fall into some kind of category, some kind of behavior.  

This is why modern psychology is mainly behaviorist sociology.  
It means that it can describe the behavior of all different parts of society using economic factors.  
If salaries go up, people have more children. If the price of something goes down, they will change their consumption habits.  
They will buy different things, go to higher-level universities, and everything becomes more and more programmed or predictable with greater accuracy.  
The statistical discrepancy becomes smaller because people become more and more determined by external situations.  

The task of God is that He gave us this talent, this ability to become creators, as He Himself is the Creator.  
This is a discussion about free will and creating every new day, not conditioned by anything else, but by your creative potential.  
Practically speaking, what does this mean? It can mean that instead of posting photos of myself,  
I may try to do mission work for the Lord, sacrificing my time, not because I am getting paid,  
but because I have higher values and am motivated by these values, not by external economic or social factors.  
Because the behaviorist assumption of science is that society is like a plant.

The more sunlight you give to a plant, it will grow in a certain way. The more nutrients you give to this plant, it will grow in a certain way.  
And it has to be like that because it is determined by the laws of nature.  
Similarly, humankind is becoming more and more like that. People think they are gaining more and more freedom, but they are not.  
Instead, they become like a herd of animals rushing to some place because of external factors.  
If you catch one of those animals—let’s say, a goat—it will be very stubborn.  
It will not want to do what you ask it to do. It is very stubborn.  
And that is what we see in many people. They claim to be individualistic, saying, "You cannot take my freedom. I am free."  
But when something happens, everybody runs in the same direction.  
And this is what will happen at the end of times. Everybody will just rush in that direction.  

From now on, we need to examine ourselves: Am I part of a crowd in some sense?  
Do I think in the same way as many other people?  
If the answer is yes, then maybe it is a problem, because Christ has to give us completely different values and a different worldview—one that is entirely distinct from anyone else in this world.  
If I am not yet determined by Christ, by love for God, then I am part of this crowd, even if I think I am super free and individualistic.  

This world also gives us a false value system. It tells us, "You have to value yourself. If you don’t value yourself, others will not value you. They will have no respect for you."  
But this is a lie of this world. Because the Lord tells us that whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.  
It is only when we break free from this selfish and narcissistic self that we can become servants of Christ.  
Only then can we receive from Him the wisdom, the power, and the life we need.  
Only then can we receive from Him even the glory of God.  
This glory will come only when we humble ourselves and have no inflated opinion of ourselves.  
Only then can we truly become servants of God.  

May the Lord help all of you to escape this spirit that is trying to trick us and draw us into this crowd, this herd.  
May you be truly free in Christ, making right decisions and choices.  
May you serve our Lord to His glory.  
May God bless all of you today.
