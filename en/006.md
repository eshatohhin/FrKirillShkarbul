# Computer games and Christianity - why it doesn’t fit

Dear brothers and sisters, let us talk today about computer games and our faith in Christ.  
We see that many people are involved—perhaps even ourselves.  
We are very much dependent on computer games, both children and adults, and now even older people spend a lot of time playing games.  
We can see it on the train, in public places, and in our workplaces. This is becoming more and more common.  
Sometimes, people come to talk to me about important matters, and I notice that at the same time, they are playing something on their smartphones.  
This is truly becoming quite concerning.  

Why does this happen? Let us consider the content and meaning of most computer games.  
In many games, you either kill people, monsters, or other creatures, or you conquer someone.  
Does this have anything to do with Christianity? No, because as Christians, we are called to sacrifice, dedicate ourselves, and abandon certain desires.  
Yet, in these games, you are encouraged to gain more, conquer others, and kill.  

Another type of game involves running or performing tasks to collect coins or money, with the goal of accumulating more wealth.  
The motivation behind this is to acquire more money, coins, or bonuses.  
This, too, is contrary to our faith in Christ, as believers are called to give, dedicate our time, money, and resources to others.  
I have never seen a game where the objective is to give to others, where the more you give, the better you become. Instead, it is the opposite.  
Nor have I seen a game where the goal is to be crucified or to sacrifice yourself.  
Rather, the goal is to kill others.  

We also see racing games where the objective is to surpass others, to be faster and quicker.  
This is rooted in vainglory and the desire to become a champion.  
Such a spirit has nothing to do with Christianity; it is the opposite of what Christ teaches us.  

Of course, there are some games that are less harmful, such as logical games that help develop reasoning skills by finding sequences or solving puzzles.  
However, the majority of games—and the ones people play the most—are the types I have just described.  

Why do people love these games so much?  
Essentially, people feel that their souls are empty, and they seek something to fill the void, to kill time, or to numb themselves.  
They use these games as a kind of drug to escape negative thoughts, depression, anxiety, or other struggles.  
Instead of addressing the root of the problem, they turn to these distractions.  
Christ is the healer, the one who can fill our souls and hearts.  
This is not just an idea; it is a reality that can truly transform us.  
Yet, instead of seeking Him, we turn to these "morphines," these painkillers, while the sickness within us grows worse.  
We try not to feel it, but it only deepens.  

People become addicted, and it is often impossible to break free from such habits without the Lord's help.  
This is especially dangerous for children, as it can be highly destructive.  
Their minds are still forming, and these games nurture a mindset focused on surpassing others, killing, and accumulating wealth.  
This shapes their character in ways contrary to Christian values.  

We must recognize this danger and seek ways to communicate with God instead of relying on these "painkillers."  
We can compare this to a prison, where people often kill time unless they are fervent Christians who pray.  
Most of the time, however, they simply pass the time.  
Prison is a parable for hell—people do not enjoy their time there.  

Let us, therefore, turn to Christ, the true healer, and seek His presence to fill the emptiness in our souls.  
May we find our joy and purpose in Him rather than in the fleeting distractions of this world.

And that is why they feel the need to kill their time.  
This also shows us that, in a sense, we are already living in a "hellish" situation.  
The emptiness in our hearts reflects this, and we try to fill it by killing time with these distractions.  
This does not mean we must completely eliminate all forms of entertainment or relaxation.  
Sometimes, when we are tired, we need a little rest, and playing games can be part of that.  
However, it is better to avoid the harmful types of games I mentioned earlier.  

There are many other good ways to spend our time and find rest.  
We can read poetry, listen to uplifting music, call our friends and family to share kind words,  
or engage in creative activities like writing poems, drawing, or painting.  
There are countless ways to relax and relieve stress that do not harm us.  
We can also study something new or pursue meaningful hobbies.  
These activities enrich our lives rather than serving as surrogates for what truly fulfills us.  

The danger lies in using these things as substitutes for God.  
Instead of allowing Christ to heal the wounds in our hearts, we fill them with distractions.  
We place something else in that void rather than inviting God to bring true healing and salvation.  

These are the things I encourage everyone to reflect on.  
We must not seek to escape the real world by retreating into the fantastical, fairy-tale worlds created by games and virtual reality.  
The Lord has given us a mission to create, to manage, and to transform the real world.  
We are made in the image of God, and He calls us to continue His work of making this world better.  
We are not meant to flee from it but to engage with it purposefully.  

God wants us to accumulate treasures in heaven, and to do so, we must live fully in this world.  
We must learn how to live a Christian life, rooted in faith and love, rather than chasing after fake coins in artificial realities.  

May God help us, give us His heart, and bless us with the wisdom to live in a way that honors Him.  
Let us seek Him above all else and find our true rest and fulfillment in His presence.
