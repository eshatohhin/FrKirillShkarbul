# “How to live” VS. “Why to live”

Dear friends, the Holy Church is now celebrating the Feast of the Transfiguration of our Lord. I hope everyone can learn more about this feast, though we are not going to discuss it today. Instead, we will explore an interesting topic related to this feast.

This feast is connected to the Old Testament celebration of Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles. When the people of Israel were liberated from Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and were freed from slavery. They entered the desert and set up tents, unsure of where to go or what to do, but they were free. This physical liberation from Pharaoh’s slavery ultimately brought us the spiritual liberation that Christ has given us. The Transfiguration of the Lord represents the goal of our Christian life: to receive this freedom and the glory of God, to welcome the kingdom of heaven into our hearts, freeing us from sin and all other limitations. But how do we achieve this? The Lord told us, "Whoever loses their life for my sake will find it." This is the true life we receive when we deny ourselves.

Today, I want to discuss two things. Often in life, we ask ourselves, "How do I live?" The focus becomes our daily life: our standard of living, what we can afford, our salary, our possessions, the food we eat, the entertainment we enjoy, our next vacation, or how we will spend the upcoming weekend. Life becomes consumed by these concerns. People, economics, and politics are all preoccupied with this. A good politician is seen as one who can provide good pensions, security, low crime rates, and stable, prosperous living conditions. Technology, too, is focused on improving our quality of life—better cars, ships, spaceships, and capabilities. All these things revolve around how we live.

But God did not create man solely to be concerned with these matters. He created us to ask, "Why do I live? What is the meaning of life? What is the purpose of my existence?" These questions should be central to each of us and to society as a whole. If the world’s goal is merely prosperity, wealth, and stable development, it loses its meaning in the eyes of God. Therefore, we must reflect daily on why we live and what the goal of our life is. Otherwise, life becomes like that of a fly—finding a big cake or a jar of honey, enjoying its sweetness, and thinking it has everything it needs for a lifetime. But there is so much more to life than mere survival or comfort. We are called to seek a higher purpose, to live for something greater than ourselves.

And for the whole family of this fly. But this is not what we are like. We are not ants, flies, or cockroaches, whose sole concern is to have plenty, comfort, and sufficiency. We are created in the image of God, and this is why we must ask these deeper questions. We need to have a clear direction in life: Where are we going, and why do we live? Of course, we must be cautious, because some who ask these questions arrive at wrong answers. This is why we have ideologies, tyrannies, and dictatorships that suppress those who oppose them. When our life goals cause pain, suffering, and harm to others, there is something fundamentally wrong with our values and direction. 

We need to find Christ and learn how to follow Him. This must become the meaning of our lives. But this can only happen if we die to ourselves. Even when we visit holy places or monasteries, what do we often ask for? We ask for help in our situations: "God, help me make the right decision—should I sell my house or not? Should I immigrate? Protect me, give me strength, heal me, grant me peace." These requests are tied to how we live, how we enjoy life, and whether it is stable and comfortable. But this mindset enslaves us. It prevents us from attaining true spiritual freedom and living a fruitful spiritual life.

Let us reflect on these things. We see that today’s youth lack clear goals, and moral life continues to deteriorate. The reason is that young people do not see a clear direction or purpose. We live in a post-structuralist, post-modernist, post-Christian age where there are no goals or direction, and this is deeply dangerous. Remember the righteous in the time of Noah or Lot. People were eating, drinking, marrying, building houses, and planting trees, but suddenly the flood came and destroyed everyone except one family. Similarly, in Lot’s time, life seemed fine—the economy was thriving, everything was running smoothly—but on the very day Lot left Sodom and Gomorrah, the cities were destroyed by God. Their existence had no meaning beyond the presence of one righteous family.

Let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that everything is fine because others appear to serve God. We must learn to serve God ourselves. If we have hearts that love Christ and are willing to sacrifice ourselves, we will gain true spiritual freedom. A Christian should feel as though they have been "fired" or "thrown away" from this world. They no longer cling to it or grasp for its comforts. Though it may seem like a loss, they gain immense freedom in Christ. Let us cultivate such hearts and embrace this freedom. Amen.
