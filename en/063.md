# Power of Lent to kill evil

Dear friends, the holy church has entered into the time of Great Lent. This week is the first week of Lent, and we need to think deeply about the meaning of Lent and our task, our goal that we have. Many people say, "Well, God is spirit, and we are spiritual; we need spiritual life, we need to pray more, we need to repent, we need to have a stronger will to know more of the Gospel." Why do we need to fast? This is food; these are external things. Does God, the Creator of the universe, care about whether I eat a sandwich or a carrot, or what I eat and how much I eat? He doesn't care about this. So there is this temptation to say, "Well, okay, this is all tradition coming from people, and this is some nonsense." And even if we don't say this, some people say, "Okay, yes, we are traditionalists; we keep fasting, but it's much more important not to get angry, not to accuse others, and other things. Then how much you eat, what you eat—all of that is secondary." So even within the church, some people think that way. And there is a big mistake in this.

The main reason and the main task of Christ, that He came to this earth, is to resurrect faith in people. And this meant conquering matter by spirit. For example, all the miracles that He performed. Say He was walking on the water. This is matter—water—and He is walking on top of the waters. He is conquering the laws of nature, the physical world. And then He said to Peter, when Peter asked, "I want to come; tell me to come to You," He said, "Come." And Peter was walking on the waters. And this is what a person who has faith has to be able to learn to do—to walk upon the waters. This is our task as Christians. This is what faith is. Faith is not just to believe that God exists. It's not just to believe that Jesus is the Savior. These are just concepts. And we can accept these concepts, but this doesn't change our life unless we have faith as this power coming from God to conquer this material world.

Other miracles, like resurrecting people who had died—death, it's all gone. This is the law of this world, of matter in this world, of the mortal body—it dies. But God is resurrecting them. He is calling them back to life, conquering this matter. He breaks the bread. With only five loaves of bread and two fish, He fed 5,000 men, maybe 20,000 people. And they were fed because they came to listen to the Lord, and they had faith in Him. And He acted upon their faith and gave them what they needed. So He was winning over these laws of nature. And even this symbolism, that He enters Jerusalem on a donkey, also means that He is conquering matter. The donkey represents matter, and He is sitting upon it. And so He is bringing the full victory of spirit over matter. And this is what we learn during Lent—to win over matter by spirit with the help of God.

And you may ask, "Well, why did He create us as material beings? Why do I have this mortal body? Why not just make me an angel? If we were angels, we would be above matter. If matter is evil, as the Gnostics said—that matter is evil, and we need to escape from this prison, that this material body is a prison for my soul—all of that is harmful heresy. Because the task that He gives to us is to be material but to conquer this matter by spirit. It would be too easy if we were just angels. You don't need to conquer anything; you're already flying in the heavens. But He wants us to be here on this material, fallen earth, and to be victors—to be conquerors of this matter, spiritually conquering. Not by technology—though technology also—but first and foremost, spiritually.

So what He tells the Jews: "You are from below, and I am from above. What I tell you are the words of God." And what does "below" mean? Below means that people live according to the laws of this world, the common wisdom of this world, saying that others will not care about you, so you need to care about yourself all the time.

And you need to accumulate a lot of money so that you have enough for retirement. And other people—they are your rivals, competitors. So you need to be like a wolf. You need to be on your own. And all of those things... well, they say it works. This is how the world works. Why? Because it's a fallen world. And we need to go against all of that logic. That logic comes from the material, fallen world. For us, another logic works—the logic of the Gospel of Christ. And He said that by faith, you will conquer all those things. So this is what we learn during the Great Lent. The task of Christ was to resurrect faith in people, to bring them back to life, not to live by those worldly rules. The Jewish people were living by those rules, coming from below. They cared about that. And the pagans—even worse—because the pagans worshipped the material elements. They saw that power comes from the sun, so they worshipped the sun. They saw that the sea was a source of danger, so they worshipped the sea. They became worshippers of creation. And then there’s astrology—the idea that the stars determine things. All of that nonsense. God was not pleased. Even worshipping animals and many other things. For the Lord, this is an abomination—when people, instead of worshipping the Creator, worship the created things, the world, and its elements. This is what God hates. And this leads to worshipping demons, which are behind these passions and desires. This is also why He said that only through prayer and fasting can you conquer demons. 

Some people say, "Does the demon care what I eat?" Yes, he does. He doesn’t care about what you eat; he cares whether you are determined by your passions and desires or whether you are free and driven by the spirit. If you are driven by the spirit, then he will flee from you. He will run away. And this is why Lent and fasting are called *fasting*. It’s not called "read more Bible" or "time of more intensive prayer." No, it’s called *fasting* because the most fundamental thing is: Can you conquer your belly, your flesh? Some people say, "It’s not important what you eat." Well, it wouldn’t be important if you could eat a few things and still remain a little bit hungry. Or if you could eat food that is not tasty—something you don’t like at all—and just a little bit, so you’re still hungry. If you can live like that, yes, you’re already fine. The food part of Lent is not so important for you. But who is like that? I’ve never met people like that. 

We are determined by this "pharaoh" inside us—this flesh. This is our old self. We are determined by our fallen flesh and desires. This is why we want to eat tasty food. We want to eat on time—breakfast, lunch, dinner. We want to eat enough so that we’re not hungry, so that we’re full. We always want to be like that. So the Church tells us, "Okay, now begin with this. If you really want to have strong faith that can determine things, that can help you change your whole life, then begin with this little thing. Try to tell your belly, 'No, you want breakfast today? No breakfast. You want tasty food today? No tasty food.'" This is how the spirit conquers matter. This is the meaning of Lent and fasting. And when we can win over these fleshly desires, these carnal things, then God can lead us, and we can have a spiritual life.

So this is how it is created. There is a kind of antagonism between matter and spirit. We are material beings, but we have spirit, and it must conquer this matter. Only then can we become the salt of the earth, of this world. Salt is what changes the world. If we can first change ourselves—with God's grace, of course, because we cannot do it alone—then we can become instruments of transformation. Some people say, "Well, of course, I can decide what to eat. Some people are vegans; they don’t eat any meat at all." But if you truly try to fast and seek advice on how to fast in your specific situation, you will discover that you cannot do it by yourself. You will come to understand and see your limitations. This brings humility and repentance, revealing that without God, I am a slave to my desires. I am perishing, going down, heading toward hell. This is why I need the Savior. I need to repent, and I need His grace to become united with Him. 

Through this process, we gain purity and become poor in spirit. "Blessed are the poor in spirit," as the Lord said. We come to understand that, on our own, we cannot achieve this. We cannot truly fast without God’s help and grace. But if we forget about ourselves, if we abandon self-reliance and stop counting on our own strength, then the Lord will give us His help and grace in fasting and in drawing near to Him. He will give us wisdom, and we will conquer this matter, becoming true soldiers of Christ. 

So let us remember this. Let us not think, "Oh, it’s just some rule. It’s not important. It’s just an external rule." It can be very important if we understand its true meaning. It is not merely an external rule, like a diet. It is about conquering our carnal flesh, and through this, we can even conquer evil and evil spirits. Fasting can help us overcome evil spirits. May the Lord give us this joy and eagerness to put effort into this year’s Lent. It began yesterday, March 15, and will end on May 1, the last day of Lent. During this time, we abstain from meat, dairy, and eggs, and some people also avoid fish and eat less. This is the dietary aspect. 

But, of course, we also add much more prayer, spiritual reading, and deeds of mercy. We avoid conflicts, speak less, and refrain from unnecessary discussions or events. We focus on repentance, prayer, and attending church more often. This is a time when we elevate ourselves to a higher spiritual level. We dedicate all our time and effort to spiritual growth, revival, and strengthening our faith. May the Lord give you the joy of this season and His blessing. Amen. God bless.
