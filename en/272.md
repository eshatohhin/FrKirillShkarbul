# A bunch of fake “Traditionalisms”

Dear brothers and sisters, the Orthodox Church is known for its traditionalism. Most importantly, the holy tradition, which has been passed down from the apostles. The word "tradition" comes from "tradere," meaning to give over. It is something that has been handed down from generation to generation of Christians, preserving us in unity with Christ through the right faith and the right spirituality, where the Holy Spirit lives and guides the Church through the centuries.

However, since many of us are weak in our spirituality—and I will explain this further later—we often misunderstand this traditionalism. Today, I want to discuss seven types of fake traditionalism that are very common within the Orthodox Church. I also made a video about the points of breaking into the Church, which you might find helpful if you wish to watch it.

So, what are these fake traditionalisms?

The first one, which is especially evident today, is the adherence to nationalism, government, or some political agenda. This happens particularly in churches that have become as large as a country. I am not only referring to Russia; smaller countries like Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece also face this problem, where traditionalism is often misunderstood as a bond with the government. This is Cesarism—being too close to Caesar—and it is not part of the holy tradition. Although historical events have contributed to this closer bond, it is by no means inherent in the Church's faith itself. We must be free from any nationalistic or political agenda that seeks to use us for its own purposes. Many people are misled by this, and we know where it leads: to situations where people who go to Church end up going to war with each other. The world has changed significantly from what it was 1,500 years ago, but some mindsets remain. Let us be aware of this fake traditionalism. The Lord told the apostles John and James, when they wanted to destroy a Samaritan village with fire, "You do not know what spirit you are of. The spirit of the gospel is the spirit of love." This political traditionalism perverts the very essence of the gospel. Let us be aware of this and not become victims of it.

The second fake traditionalism is the so-called "old believers" or "old right" traditionalism. What is wrong with this kind of traditionalism? The story of the old right is complex. It exists in Russia, Greece, and other countries. The old right has a spirit of extremism—you can condemn someone for just one letter. If you do not adhere strictly to these rules, you are damned. The way you act, move, or speak must fit a rigid, almost magical formula for it to be valid. If it does not, you are a heretic, and it is all fake. This obsession with formalities and hatred toward anyone outside this small circle—whether it be the patriarchal church in Russia, which they claim is the church of the Antichrist, or the government, which they also label as the Antichrist—creates a paranoid and gloomy worldview. They see Satan everywhere, and if you do not agree with them, you are "chipped" or part of some conspiracy. This spirit of fear, hatred, and paranoia is not limited to the old believers; it is also present within the canonical Orthodox Church. Let us beware of this mindset.

The third type of fake traditionalism is quite common among missionaries. It is somewhat similar to the previous types but distinct. I would call it **legalism**. Legalism is about fitting into rigid frameworks or "kennels" (canons) in every small detail. If you deviate even slightly, you are condemned as a heretic, a sectarian, or worse. For example, there are canons that forbid you from sharing a public bath with a Jew. So, if you go to a fitness club and happen to shower in the same room as a Jew, you are doomed—you violate the canon and are destined for hell. This is just one example, but it illustrates the mindset. It often involves a very literal understanding of the Bible. For instance, they might ask, "Do you believe the world was created in six 24-hour days? Yes or no?" If you say, "Maybe it’s something else," you are labeled a heretic and condemned. This kind of spirit is far removed from the gospel. Many missionaries who preach this way have great zeal, but I would call them psychologically imbalanced, to say the least. It is also a Pharisee-like spirit.

The fourth type of fake traditionalism is what I would simply call **hatred of LGBT individuals and liberal values**. For some, this becomes the main focus of their faith. They identify as Orthodox because they hate these things, and they cannot talk about their faith without expressing their hatred. While the Church does not approve of such lifestyles—they are considered mortal sins—we should not be obsessed with constantly screaming about them. There was a movement in Russia before the revolution called the **Black Hundred**, composed of low-class peasants who radically defended Orthodoxy. Many Jewish pogroms were carried out by people associated with this group. In those days, even some saints, like St. John of Kronstadt, blessed these movements. However, today, this has evolved into paramilitary groups of fanatics, such as the infamous "Death or Orthodoxy." They wear black t-shirts with skulls, act hostile, and try to intimidate others, saying, "If you touch Orthodoxy, you will die." This spirit is far removed from the gospel.

The fifth type of fake traditionalism is what I would call **aesthetic traditionalism** or **souvenir traditionalism**. It is like a *khokhloma* or *matryoshka*—it is all about the aesthetic appeal. People admire the beautiful cupolas on churches, dress up in traditional attire, and participate in processions of the cross, taking lots of pictures. For them, Orthodoxy is about how nice and beautiful it looks. This is superficial and akin to cosplay—a fake, degenerate form of religion. It is also a kind of fetishism, reminiscent of pagan masquerades. This is not true Orthodoxy.

The sixth type of fake traditionalism is an **obsession with miracles**. Some people focus excessively on miraculous events, often to the detriment of the deeper spiritual life. While miracles are part of the Church's history and faith, an unhealthy fixation on them can lead to superstition and a distorted understanding of Orthodoxy. True faith is not built on chasing miracles but on a living relationship with Christ and the Church.

The sixth type of fake traditionalism is an **obsession with miracles or elders who act like fortune tellers**. People travel far, even to Siberia, to stand in line and hear an elder say a few words, which they treat as divine oracles. Their faith becomes centered on these elders and miracles, and they collect stories of miraculous events, getting excited about them. However, they often miss the essence of faith—who Christ is—and may never even open the Gospels. This is a shallow understanding of Orthodoxy. Many of these miracle stories come from Byzantine legends or medieval writings that are more like folk tales than literal truths. For example, an icon of the Mother of God with three hands is not meant to be taken as a literal depiction but as a symbolic representation. This kind of traditionalism is like a fantasy or fairy tale religion—a "metaverse" for Orthodox believers. It is important to be aware of this and not fall into such superficial spirituality.

The seventh type of fake traditionalism is the belief that Orthodoxy is solely about **dogmas and correct theology**. Some think that knowing or accepting the right dogmas is all that is needed to be saved. They may not even fully understand these dogmas but believe that simply affirming them makes them special, saved, and Orthodox. This is a very rationalistic and superficial understanding of faith. Even demons know the dogmas, but they do not love God and are not saved. While preserving the dogmas is important, it is not enough. True faith also involves spiritual practice, humility, repentance, and taking up one's cross. Many who fall into this trap lack an understanding of the cross and the narrow path to salvation. They replace true spirituality with pride and idolize traditions, slipping into a fake spirituality led by blind spiritual leaders.

In conclusion, these seven types of fake traditionalism—political nationalism, old believers' extremism, legalism, hatred of LGBT and liberal values, aesthetic traditionalism, obsession with miracles, and dogmatic rationalism—are traps that distort the true essence of Orthodoxy. There are even more such pitfalls, but the key is to remain faithful to Christ, humble, and compassionate. Let us pray for wisdom and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to avoid these traps and walk the narrow path of salvation, bearing witness to the love and humility of the Gospel. May God bless us all, brothers and sisters.
