# Artificial Intelligence & antichrist

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about artificial intelligence and how it relates to our faith and to the final days of this world. With the ongoing reset taking place, there will be more and more digital advancements, more and more AI, and some people do not see any danger in it. They simply say, "Well, it's a development of science; it brings a lot of convenience." But we need to look beyond these superficial things. I do not want to make this sound frightening, and we are not afraid of anything—not of people, not of machines, not of the Antichrist. We are not afraid. However, we need to understand what is happening, what is going on, and how to approach the things that are taking place.

So, what is artificial intelligence? You know what it is. In daily life, it will mean that you won't have people in government offices or banks; it will be machines. You will come, apply for documents, subsidies, or for your child to be taken to school, and many other things. It will all be done by robots. They will answer your questions, make assessments, and even make decisions. It will be very convenient because you won't have to stand in long lines or worry about clerks being unpleasant, unhappy, or corrupt. There will be no corruption because everything will be transparent, governed by algorithms. On the surface, this seems very nice and convenient. However, let us consider deeply what else may be involved.

Of course, there are countless examples of AI—smart fridges, smart toilets, smart everything. You can research this yourself; it's all out there. Today, we will focus more on the spiritual implications of this. AI will know everything about everybody, including your health information, hobbies, and contacts. It will track where you go and whom you meet to prevent the spread of viruses. It will know almost everything about you. With facial recognition, you can use your face to access whatever you are supposed to access. There will be many advantages to this. People say, "Well, this is like cars or computers; you can't go against it. It's just science." Science is science, but we need to see what it will mean for each of us.

AI will trace and track everything you do, where you are right now, and predict where you will go and what you will do. It will know your values, the kind of friends you have, your political views, your religious views. It will know what products to sell you and how to sell them. We already see this with Google and Facebook—they know what you search for. All that data, big data, is being assembled. Essentially, it knows you better than you know yourself. Later, it will also conduct social ratings: Are you reliable? Are you not reliable? Your behavior, your creditworthiness—many things are already being introduced. It's not entirely new, but it will become more prevalent, like the social rating system in China.

It will also decide how much to give you. There is talk of exclusive capitalism, which resembles socialism. It will determine if you are worthy of something—should you receive more or less? Should your freedoms be restricted? Should you be allowed to travel overseas or to another country? All of this will eventually come to pass. This is what they want. It may not happen tomorrow, but it is the direction we are heading.

Now they're trying with QR codes and similar technologies. Maybe it will take much longer to fully develop, but this is the direction we're heading. We can already see the picture forming. With these pandemics, we’ve also realized that we’re not as free as we thought. Everything can be shut down immediately—airlines, businesses, and even personal movement. In some countries, people were not allowed to leave their homes or apartments. They were locked inside. We can already see many of these things happening. The goal seems to be to prolong these measures, creating a long-lasting effect.

This intelligence will also be used to shape your worldview, your mindset—especially for the younger generation, who will be the most affected. However, older generations will also have their views, values, and morals influenced. Essentially, everything will be shaped by this system. The main issue is that you won’t be able to object. There will be no one to blame because it’s just an algorithm. If the government, or parts of it, are run by this system, it won’t need opposition. A computer doesn’t need opposition. You can’t rally against it or propose alternatives. It will simply be there, unchallengeable.

What’s most interesting is that it will be embraced by everyone. People will like it because it will be convenient, smooth, and make life easier. You won’t have to worry about many things, and there will be no corruption. As a result, it will be embraced globally. If you want to oppose it, you’ll need a global movement, which will likely be very marginal. The number of people who will have issues with it will be small, and you won’t be able to do much about it. You’ll be squeezed into the rules imposed by this system. Eventually, it may even punish you for any disagreement. We’ve seen this in many dystopian movies, and now it’s being discussed as a real possibility.

What’s important to understand is that it’s not about who is doing it—whether it’s some occult group, a world government, or evil individuals. That’s not the main point. The Lord mentioned the "prince of this world," who has nothing in Him. This "prince of this world" is what? It’s mammon—the power that drives people through greed, desires, and the pursuit of luxury and consumption. This mammon has nothing to do with Christ. It has been around for centuries, and it’s always sought to eliminate the Church. In ancient times, emperors demanded worship and saw the Church as a threat, persecuting it. In Soviet times, totalitarian regimes like Lenin’s oppressed the Church, trying to eliminate it. The Church saw these as antichrists, but all of this was preparation for what is to come.

The problem isn’t the individual dictators or leaders. The problem is the spirit behind them. This spirit hasn’t gone away; it’s stronger than ever and has more capabilities now. So, what does this "prince of this world" want? He wants an upgrade—an electronic network, a mesh so stable that it cannot be overthrown. This is the ultimate goal: a system so deeply embedded in society that it becomes inescapable.

It will simply be there—not tied to any specific country or ideology. It will transcend borders and systems, aiming to be absolutely unbreakable, with full and total control over everything. This will become an ongoing process, enhancing the capabilities of this AI system. The whole world will adopt AI, and it will be total and global. Most importantly, people will willingly embrace it. The development of this system will be seen as the progress of humanity—like upgrading from iPhone 9 to iPhone 10. In this way, the regime will grow tighter and tighter.

Now, let’s consider the coming of the Antichrist. The Holy Fathers tell us that it’s not the Antichrist himself who will come first, but rather the kingdom of the Antichrist. This kingdom can be understood as a regime or a system—a new world order, version X. We don’t know which version it will be, but we are already seeing the beginnings of a new world order with the pandemic. There will be newer and newer versions of this order, and it will continue to evolve. We know from the Bible that this will happen, though we don’t know when—perhaps in 100 years, perhaps in 1,000 years. But it will happen at some point.

Think about this AI system. If everyone embraces it, as they are now with the pandemic, it will become deeply entrenched. Laws are already being enacted in many countries, like Russia and others, to implement AI. Everyone is talking about it, and it will be done. It will grow more pervasive, and people will like it—the majority, at least. Do you think it will go away? I don’t think so. It will remain with humanity, perhaps until the end of days, and it will only grow stronger.

Logically, we can understand that in the times of the Antichrist—whenever that may be—AI will be a tool used by the Antichrist. It’s simple: the Antichrist will use AI. Why? Because it will be incredibly useful. It will know everything about you, control you, educate you, and even eliminate you if it disagrees with you. It will become your everything. In the Bible, Psalm 17:2 (translated from Greek) can be interpreted to mean, "My destiny comes from your face or your presence." Another way to translate it is, "The judgment comes from your face." If we embrace this system, our destiny will no longer come from our boss or any human authority—it will come from the machine. The AI will decide. It will judge whether you deserve something or not.

People will see this system as the source of everything for them. At some point, it will take on a religious meaning because everything—your entire destiny—will come from it. If you have a pet, its destiny comes from you. You control its life completely. If you don’t feed it, it will die. In the same way, this system will control humanity. The Antichrist, instead of God or Christ, will present himself as the savior. The system will be seen as the savior, promising to liberate people, care for the poor, and save the planet from pandemics and ecological disasters. It will sound noble and compassionate, but in reality, it will be a tool of control, replacing God with a machine.

And every time you hear the word "savior," you must think of the true Savior. Perhaps this system is coming *instead* of Him. In your heart, you may become more grateful to this system than you are to Jesus Christ. This is why we recall the words of the Apostle Paul, who said that we, as Christians, are like garbage to this world. The world doesn’t want us because it wants to live in sin, in filth, and to enjoy all that is corrupted. But the Church, the light, shines and reveals the evil for what it is. Of course, this sinful, corrupted world is unhappy about this. It wants Christianity gone. For decades, we’ve seen grand cathedrals standing empty. This isn’t something new; it’s been happening for centuries. People have abandoned Christ and the Church, and this is just the next step in that process.

That’s why so many are excited about these new developments—they will replace Christ even more thoroughly. Right now, we don’t face direct persecution, but it will come. And when it does, there won’t be many who object. There may even be churches that are nominally Christian but have abandoned true faith. Let us remember the schemes of Satan. As the Apostle Paul said, we are not ignorant of Satan’s plans. Today, we’ve discussed those plans. There’s no need to be afraid, but we must be aware. When we hear about AI, we shouldn’t react with fear or run away. Instead, we must recognize its implications and be wise.

Another important point is that the Church often survives where there is mercy. For example, during Soviet times, priests were denied food rations so they would starve. But people showed mercy, sharing their rations with the priests. Some churches were not allowed to exist officially, but local officials, moved by a faithful relative or neighbor, would turn a blind eye and let them continue. This human factor—this mercy—allowed the Church to endure. But with AI, there will be no human factor. It will be removed entirely. The system will decide everything. No exceptions. No mercy. At some point, everything will be so tightly controlled that there will be no escape. It will be over for you.

So let us be mindful of this. Let us not be naive or overly optimistic. Christ tells us to be vigilant. Don’t be afraid, but be watchful and strong in your faith. Use every day you have to do something meaningful, to do good for the glory of God. May the Lord help each of you and bless you. Amen.
