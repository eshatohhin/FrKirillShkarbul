# Explosions etc “you will know them from their fruits.”

Hey brothers and sisters, today I'm in Taichung, in the middle of Taiwan. Yesterday we had a divine service here, and today in this beautiful park, we have a meeting with our parishioners. We’re having a picnic here, and before we started, I decided to record this video.

We hear many troubling news stories these days, and today I want to share my thoughts on how this fits into the gospel and the overall biblical perspective on world history. We hear so much about wars, explosions, and all kinds of terror happening around the world. It may seem like chaotic phenomena or just the result of individual interests, which is easy to understand, but this can give us some clues. The Lord said that He will judge people by their deeds, not by who they say they are, but by what they do. Let’s take this step by step.

What we see in the Bible—and I’ll draw some parallels today—is that in the Old Testament, there was Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus IV, who lived in the 2nd century BC. This Epiphanes waged religious persecution, chasing the Jews, the Israelites, who at that time were God’s chosen people, the Old Testament church. He destroyed many of them, used blasphemy, and placed idols in the Holy Temple. This idol was the abomination of desolation. This approach to the holy place essentially came from this evil man, and Antiochus Epiphanes became a symbol of the Antichrist for future generations, until Adonai revealed the true Antichrist, the one who is against God. That was one example.

Today, we see many churches being destroyed or desecrated. I just returned from Canada, where many churches over 100 years old have been turned into hotels, condominiums, restaurants, or daycare centers. Some have been demolished because it’s more efficient to use the land for other purposes. This is the touch of modern economy, you might say—it’s just how money works. But who is the prince of this world?

Moving forward in history, we can also see many churches being destroyed in Ukraine and even in Russia, Orthodox countries where these churches are not only destroyed but sometimes taken over by schismatics or the government. They are taken away from the people. Just yesterday, one of the parishioners here in Taichung shared with me that they had a church in their village. One Sunday, they went there and found it occupied by schismatics who had used force to take over the building. Now, to attend the true church and participate in the true Divine Liturgy, they have to travel two hours to another village or build another church, which is not easy. Alternatively, they have to pray at home, which is not the same as a full service. It’s a big temptation—either they become schismatic and attend that church or face these challenges. This has become widespread since the war began in February this year.

This is about the church and how it’s being desecrated and taken away from the faithful. We also see in history figures like Herod, who killed many children—boys aged two and under—because he feared that the Messiah might be among them. He killed 14,000 children, and mothers wept as the prophecy was fulfilled: “A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.” This is what we see now with all the wars happening today.

There is so much sorrow in the world now because mothers are losing their sons. Just yesterday, one of our parishioners told me about her friend whose five sons were mobilized—not because they wanted to go, but because they were forcefully taken to war. Most of those people will be killed. This is the great mourning, the great weeping that is happening right now, and it will only get worse.

Another parallel is Herod, who also killed many who opposed his cooperation with the Romans. We know the Romans were the dominant power, and some people resisted them. In the Gospel, we read that Herod mixed the blood of those who opposed him with the blood of the sacrifices they were offering. These were religious people, praying and offering sacrifices to God, yet Herod killed them and mixed their blood with that of the sacrificed animals. This is also happening today. In many countries, anyone who opposes government policies cannot speak out. We see this in China, Russia, many Muslim countries, and even in so-called democratic nations, where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to oppose certain programs. For example, if you disagree with measures taken during epidemics or hold a political stance different from what’s promoted through mass media, you’ll likely face trouble. At the very least, you might be silenced on social media platforms like YouTube. This is not new, but it’s getting worse.

Another parallel can be drawn to the early church during the time of Emperor Nero in the 50s and 60s AD. Nero set fire to Rome because he wanted to build a new world, a world of his dreams, and then blamed Christians for the destruction. Today, we see the whole world in flames, in the midst of a great crisis, and out of this chaos, they aim to build a new world order. Christians and anyone who speaks out, who says things should be done differently, are labeled as the bad guys, as guilty, as enemies of humanity. Similar things happened with Lenin—those who opposed his vision of a new world were deemed enemies of humanity and the proletariat. These processes today are quite similar to what happened in the days of Nero.

All these parallels I’m drawing tell us something significant. One last parallel I want to mention is the experience of revolutionaries throughout history. Whether in 17th-century Britain, where capitalists fought royalists, or during the French Revolution, which saw massive killings, fires, and bombings, or the Russian and Chinese Revolutions, we see a pattern. Revolutionaries have always been drawn to bombs and explosions. They love setting the world on fire, believing that destruction will bring about change. This is why they embrace such methods. Recently, we’ve seen this with the explosion of the bridge to Crimea and other large-scale attacks. The methods remain the same—nothing has changed.

This brings me to the idea of the new world order. There’s a Masonic phrase: “Out of chaos, order comes.” They set the world in chaos so they can bring about their own order, presenting themselves as saviors. Of course, they won’t admit they created the chaos; they’ll claim to be the ones bringing salvation. We see this with ecology, poverty, and every major issue—they position themselves as the solution, the saviors of the world.

And this will lead to slavery and dictatorship. We are heading toward a new world of dictatorship. These events should make us think. Today, I don’t want to talk about politics, but I want everyone to reflect on the parallels we see with the Bible and the gospel. When the prince of this world seeks to establish something, he uses fire, sickness, explosions, suffering, wars, and policies that kill people on a massive scale. He uses all of this to bring about his own plan. And those who suffer the most are often those who serve the Lord the most—they are hit the hardest. Of course, millions of ordinary people are also killed in the process.

Let us think about this. I don’t believe these events are just random occurrences or news stories. We need to see the bigger picture, to look behind the scenes and understand what’s truly happening. We should not be afraid of anything. They want us to lose our peace, to live in fear, uncertainty, and chaos. But we must remain with the Lord, peaceful in our hearts, just as this park is peaceful today. No matter what happens, if we are with the Lord, with Christ, we can be victorious in any situation. We can accomplish the mission of our Lord with His blessing, to His glory. Amen.

God bless everyone. Amen.
