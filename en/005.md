# Church and politics - how to avoid the trap

Dear friends, today we are going to talk about an important topic—the relationship between the church and politics.  

We remember that the Lord, in Matthew 22:21, said, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." This establishes a distinction between divine and earthly matters, and we should not mix the two together.  

The church is concerned with the Kingdom of Heaven—how to witness, to bring the testimony of the Kingdom of Heaven to people, and to help them find the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the goal of the church.  

Therefore, whenever you see church leaders, priests, or bishops getting involved in political rallies or supporting specific candidates, you must remember what we discussed last time: the greatest danger for the church and any Christian organization is secularization. This occurs when the mindset of church members becomes similar to that of people outside the church, who are concerned with power, earthly interests, and other such matters.  

Church leaders, especially those who represent the church, may become entangled in these discussions due to personal interests or fears of losing something. This excessive involvement in earthly matters becomes a stumbling block for the church. The salt loses its taste; it becomes saltless and useless.  

This is why we must distinguish between these realms. It is forbidden for a church leader to promote a political party. It is also forbidden to engage in any form of political promotion or activity on church premises. Even after church services, when we gather to socialize, have tea, or share a meal, it is forbidden to discuss politics within the church. Outside the church, people are free to do as they wish, but within the church, no.  

In the church, we are all brothers and sisters, united in Christ. A Christian should embody this unity anywhere, even outside the church, avoiding quarrels—especially with fellow believers—over political matters. Such discussions divide people, create hostility, and sometimes even split families. We must avoid this.  

Having said that, we must also remember that the church has existed under all kinds of political systems and regimes—monarchies, empires, democracies, communist systems, fascist regimes, and even in Nazi Germany. The church has endured and carried out its mission under various conditions.  

While some political systems may make the church's mission difficult—and there have been rulers who persecuted the church—others have supported it, providing benefits and privileges to aid its mission and social ministry. The church is capable of responding to different policies. When policies are beneficial to the church, the church can express support for those policies—but not for the politicians themselves.  

We must avoid making judgments about politicians, labeling one as great and another as lousy. Such judgments should be avoided. However, we can respond to policies.  

We also remember that during times of persecution, when the church seemed to face insurmountable challenges, it often emerged stronger. Even when the number of Christians was small and the mission was hindered, their faith grew stronger, enabling them to survive under extremely difficult conditions. This adversity brought health to the church.  

Conversely, during times of freedom and benefits, many people were drawn to the church, which was also a positive development.  

In summary, the church must remain focused on its divine mission, avoiding entanglement in earthly political matters while navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by different political systems.

There were many opportunities for the mission during these times; however, very often, Christians became more relaxed and less eager to live according to the teachings of the Lord. As a result, the church grew weaker spiritually, even as it expanded in size and gained more external resources—financial, media, and otherwise. At times, the behavior of both the faithful and the clergy betrayed Christ, becoming a stumbling block for many.  

This is why we must preserve the eagerness, internal discipline, and strength that we gain during times of persecution. We must carry these qualities into times of peace and prosperity so that we can make the most of the freedoms and resources available to us. This is crucial. Otherwise, the Lord may allow governments to become hostile and oppressive, leading to renewed persecution and tribulation. Let us keep this in mind.  

That said, it is important to note that while the church is separate from the government, it is not separate from the people. The church is the people's church, not the government's church. It cares deeply for the people, especially the weak, the deprived, and those in need of extra support and prayer.  

When a government enacts laws or policies that harm the population, causing pain, social injustice, wars, or an increase in crime, the church must act as the conscience of society. It must speak out against what is wrong and harmful. While the church should avoid targeting specific individuals, it can and must criticize the government's actions when they are objectively unjust or harmful.  

This is not political involvement but rather a prophetic mission. Just as the prophets of old delivered God's message, calling out the wrongs of rulers and the moral failings of the people, the church today must continue this mission. It should not shy away from criticizing the government when necessary, but this must be done objectively, focusing on unjust practices or policies resulting from poor decisions.  

Additionally, church leaders and clergy are forbidden from engaging in public administration. The Holy Canons of the Apostles, specifically Canon 81, prohibit clergy from involvement in public administration. If a clergyman chooses to enter public administration, he must relinquish his pastoral duties. The church must remain his primary focus and responsibility.  

These are the basic principles we must uphold. In our video blog, we aim to avoid raising political or national issues because the church transcends all nations, politics, and earthly matters. We are in the world but not of the world. Our mission is to bring the message of Christ.  

Finally, we must approach others with humility, refraining from harsh criticism. We should recognize that every individual is better than us in many ways, for our sins are numerous. Even if we notice one or two flaws in someone, we should strive to see them as holy individuals. This perspective should come not just from our minds but from our hearts.

And with this in mind, we also recognize the pervasive evil in this world, as mentioned by Christ Himself—carnal pleasures, pride, and many other vices. The Apostle Paul also warned that this world lies in evil. We are acutely aware of this reality.  

This is precisely why we step forward to bring the message of Christ, carrying the testimony of our love for Him and for others—loving Him by loving people. We hope that others will be ignited by this fire of faith and that all of us can become ministers of Christ.  

May God bless you, grant you a heart full of love, and give you the wisdom to avoid harmful involvement in political quarrels or other divisive issues. May He guide you away from wrong ideas and keep you steadfast in His truth.  

God bless.
