# Does the Church support that war

To you, brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
Yesterday, we had the service here in Taichung. It was the last Easter Paschal service in Taiwan. We had services in different places, including the Procession of the Cross in Taipei. Of course, we will continue to celebrate Pascha throughout this bright week and for the next 40 days, all the way until the Ascension.  

So, we recall these days when the apostles were with Christ, the resurrected Christ. He met with them often, speaking to them about the Kingdom of Heaven. It was as if the bond, the wall between this world and the heavens, was broken. Now, it was no longer clear what was what—where heaven was and where earth was—because the resurrected Lord came so frequently and met with them. From that time onward, all these limits were broken, and we have a very profound experience of the Messiah, of the true Mashiach, during this time. This is especially true during the Pascha service itself, like the one we had last night. Every Pascha should become a greater and deeper experience of the resurrection of the Lord, the Messiah Himself.  

This is also a good indicator of our spiritual life. If there was some success during Great Lent, if our spiritual direction was correct, if our spiritual efforts bore fruit, then we experience renewal and rebirth during Pascha. We feel it—it’s a subjective reality. It’s not just, “Okay, it’s over, we’re done, we’re back to normal life, and now we can eat whatever we want.” No, it becomes a new life. We are born again in Christ; our covenant is renewed. If we have Him living in our hearts, this is the greatest joy. If we have Him communicating with us, this is also a great joy. It’s difficult to share this experience with words or descriptions, but the experience I had during the great celebration of the resurrection of the Lord is something I truly hope everyone can have. If you didn’t experience it this past Pascha, I hope you can set the goal to experience it next Pascha, or even during the regular Sunday celebration of the resurrection.  

The topic I want to talk about today is something I cannot call a revelation—I’m not a prophet, nor a Holy Father or anything like that—but I can say that I’ve experienced the true Messiah during the service: His power, His wisdom, His Spirit. This experience, which I had during last night’s service, tells me that there are many misunderstandings about what is happening in the world today. These misunderstandings stem from a lack of communication with the true Messiah. The false Messiah, the Antichrist, is trying to mimic and present himself as the Messiah. Even people in the church—Christians, clergy, and even hierarchy—might mistake his message for the message of the Savior. This is because he also appeals to truth, justice, and the suffering in this world. We know that he will come as a savior to those who suffer. For example, Lenin came claiming to save people from slavery, exploitation, and ignorance. He promised the poor industrialization, a bright future, social justice, and more. People bought into it, believed him, and followed him.

But at that time, Lenin was nothing—he was like a child, like a baby, compared to the false Messiah who is working in the world today. I think this is important for us to consider because what is happening now is influencing everyone. The events unfolding in the world and the key players involved shape our understanding of the world—how we picture it and how we explain what is going on. Some might say, “Again, you’re talking about politics and worldly matters.” But this, too, is a lie propagated by the false Messiah—the idea that the Church and Christians should only concern themselves with theological matters related to heaven and eternity.  

Christ Himself came into this world, became human, and established His Church so that He could work in this world and carry out His mission. It’s not about making this world our priority or treating it as an end in itself, but we do have clear tasks in this world that we must accomplish. To fulfill these tasks, we need to understand what is happening around us. It’s not about being worldly or politicized; rather, discussing these matters can be a witness to our faith, showing that we can rise above the limitations of this world and its logic while still being in the world and carrying out our mission. A blind man will fall into a trap, so we must be mindful and seek guidance from the true Messiah to discern what is fake and what is real.  

The question is this: With the great conflict now dividing the world into two camps—a conflict that could lead to famine, pandemics, and other troubles (the four horsemen of the apocalypse, if you will)—how should we respond? No matter how you describe it, we are facing significant challenges, and the entire world is affected. There are three positions people tend to take:  

1. Supporting one side.  
2. Supporting the other side.  
3. Distancing themselves entirely, saying, “As long as I can live a safe and peaceful life, I don’t care about these things. Let them wage war or do whatever they want. I’ll just preserve my little world, live for my family, and focus on my projects.”  

Each of these positions has its implications, and as Christians, we must seek the guidance of the true Messiah to navigate these challenges with wisdom and discernment.

All three of these reactions can lead us to failure. If we align ourselves with one side, we might end up on the wrong side—we don’t truly know which side is right or wrong. Often, in situations of division and polarization, both sides are wrong, and both will fail. Or, one side may win while the other fails, but the process will be chaotic and destructive. As for those who distance themselves, thinking they can avoid the conflict, their turn will come. We see this in the wars happening now: people who want to stay neutral are still affected as bombs fall and kill tens of thousands.  

Behind all this, the key players are not presidents, governments, corporations, or even secret societies like the Bilderberg Group or the Masons. It’s not about ideologies like capitalism versus socialism or any other "ism." The real key players are Christ, the true Messiah, who is working in this world with His goals and His project, and the Antichrist, whose spirit has always been present since ancient times. The spirit of the Antichrist has his own project, and my feeling—which I believe is correct—is that the Antichrist is behind both sides of this conflict. He is using objective realities to manipulate both parties.  

For example, there are real issues at play: nationalism, the promotion of a Western postmodern lifestyle, greed, the will to power, imperialism, and more. These things are undeniably present. Some people are willing to die for one cause, while others are willing to die for another. They believe their cause is true, and if you’re willing to die for it, you go, fight, and die. Some fight for money, others for the thrill of it. I’ve been there; I’ve seen all kinds of people—those with no faith, only greed, and those who are faithful to God. Even church leaders and clergy are not immune to deception. They don’t represent the entire Church. If a patriarch says something, it doesn’t mean the whole Church holds that position. Everyone is subject to the lies and deceit of the Antichrist, which are far more persuasive than anything Lenin ever brought. Lenin is nothing compared to this.  

This is what we are facing now. We must not say, “If the Church supports that side, then I don’t believe in such a Church. It’s fake.” No, it’s just some people expressing their opinions, shaped by decades of propaganda on both sides. This propaganda becomes part of their worldview, part of what they believe is true. This is the worldliness of the Church—its tendency to embrace the logic of this world rather than the logic of the Kingdom above.  

This is why the experience of the true Messiah is so precious. I truly feel that this is the answer our Lord Jesus Christ is giving me in this context. The Antichrist is behind both sides of this conflict, but Christ is with those who suffer. Christ is with the orphans, the bombed, the injured, the fearful—those who need care, help, compassion, and prayer. They need whatever help we can give them. That is where we can serve Christ.

This is where we can see Christ—in the suffering, in the broken, in those who need help. This is where we must act, doing as much as we can to serve Him. The Lord is also with those who pray, who repent, and who place Him at the center of their lives. Only this can protect us from the worldwide and all-encompassing deceit that surrounds us. The devil seeks to divide and confuse, forcing us into false dichotomies: red army or white army, Democrats or Republicans, socialists or communists, left or right. If you don’t choose a side, you risk being crushed in the conflict. But we are called to rise above these divisions. We don’t need to be confused or indifferent, saying, “I don’t care; I’ll just live my life.”  

The message of the Lord is clear: difficult times are coming—war, famine, deceit, death, fake Christianity, Pharisees, superstitions, and new religions. Many spiritual deceptions are on the horizon. But behind all of this, the Lord is also coming. We eagerly await His glorious second coming, which will mark the end of this world. Don’t expect Him to come earlier to establish some earthly kingdom—His true kingdom will be free of all evil, sin, and anything contrary to His will. We want to be children of that kingdom.  

Now, we must fight the good fight against the evils within us and in the world. The power and fire of His resurrection can burn away every stain and blemish from our hearts and souls, freeing us from sin, passions, and anything that controls us. Guided by His Spirit, we can avoid delusion and mistake, and we will have the strength to endure any temptation.  

As I understand it, the Church of Christ—where Christ is alive—is not on either side of the current conflict. This is why I don’t rally for one side or the other, whether for or against the war. It’s not my calling or mission—not out of fear, but because I believe the Church’s role is different. If I must risk my life to stand against the Antichrist, I hope I will have the strength to do so. I don’t persuade others to take up arms or engage in activism; that is a matter of conscience. But remember, whoever takes up the sword will die by the sword, no matter which side they are on. Violence is not our method.  

Instead, do what your conscience tells you in this situation. Don’t close your eyes or retreat to the past, pretending the war, the virus, or the conflicts don’t exist. Face what is happening now, and be prepared for even worse things to come—whether nuclear war, plague, famine, or other trials. We must stand with the Lord, facing these challenges with His help. Let Him free us from delusion and passion, guide us, and reveal His will to us. We need clarity—not just a general sense of direction, but a specific vision of what He wants from us. What is my mission in His eyes? What can I do for the true Messiah?  

This is the question we must ask ourselves. Let us seek His guidance, so that we may serve Him faithfully in these troubled times.

The false Messiah can indeed deceive you—he is capable of great trickery. May the Lord help us, grant us the joy of His resurrection, protect us from every error, and bless us with His guidance. Christ is risen—truly, He is risen!
