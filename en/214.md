# Mission in Sri Lanka Light to those sitting in the darkness of buddhism

Dear brothers and sisters, I haven't recorded any videos for some time. I was on a mission trip, and today I want to share with you about the mission in Sri Lanka. This was a very exciting and fruitful trip, and I want to tell you more about the results of this trip, the situation there, and some of the thoughts I have about the mission in general.

This mission was a great blessing for me. First of all, I want to thank God for giving me the joy to do mission work, to preach the gospel, and to invite new people into the church during this time of apostolic labor. This was a great joy, and I think it would be a great joy for any priest to have this feeling of participating directly in the work of the apostles, especially at this time when the church is being sent forth. Because this land is preparing us for apostolic work, to continue this mission.

I am very grateful to the Lord, and He also gave me the joy to see the fruits of the mission. The last time I went, in November, we had a baptism for the whole group that was preparing—33 people at the time—in the ocean. Over the past few years, they have been preparing others, and more new members have come and are getting ready. This time, there was also a baptism, with 13 people in a lake. It was a great joy and a great experience. Please pray for them, for our Orthodox Christians there. Now we have 51 baptized Orthodox in Sri Lanka, and more catechumens are preparing for baptism during my next visit, I hope, if the Lord grants me such a blessing, or if another priest goes.

This time, I traveled to many places. We have had good success in the south, as our main mission is now centered in the town of Karunagala and the surrounding region, where most of the members are located. During this visit, I also went to the south, to the Galle region and Neluwa. In those regions, we now have many more people. Reaching these areas usually requires traveling by car on poor roads, and then walking through the jungle, climbing hills—it’s quite an experience and an adventure. To reach these families scattered in the jungle, you come to a family somewhere in the jungle, and the whole family is willing to become Orthodox. We prayed with them, they asked for blessings, and they were very excited.

In the central part, we also conducted a humanitarian mission, distributing food, rice, and other essentials to families in distant villages, as the economic crisis continues. People have lost their jobs, prices have risen, and some are starving. Some have lost family members, parents, or children, and no one is left to care for them. There are many problems there now.

Mission-wise, we have some other good news. One influential man, a former prominent politician named Abiy, has decided to become Orthodox and wants to become a missionary. He is now retired but has a wide network of people who know and trust him. He plans to introduce the faith to these people, which is a very promising and joyful development.

There was also some sad news. One of the missionaries, a former Protestant pastor from the north of the island—a Tamil area that is mainly Hindu—had decided to become Orthodox. His entire community was also planning to convert. We had already agreed on how he would conduct his mission work in the city of Jaffna, and everything seemed promising. However, over time, he began to distance himself, citing internal issues. This time, I discovered that he had been drawn away by the Malankara Church, which adheres to a Monophysite heresy.

They came from India and said, "We are Orthodox; you want to be Orthodox, we are Orthodox," even though they are not—they adhere to an ancient heresy. They offered him payment, support, and ordained him as a *jinka* (a title or rank), and all of this worked. He joined them, but I think he is now struggling to determine if it is truly Orthodox. I am very hopeful that he will return at some point. So, we will pray for this, and we pray for him and for all the people in the communities he is developing. We are hopeful that this Tamil area, which is very different, can also be evangelized by the true gospel. Through that area, we might develop a mission in India, as it is to the north and is also predominantly Tamil, the same ethnic group. They share the same language, and if God blesses us, we might be able to develop a mission in India as well. This is very logical, as the Indian mission is currently in a very poor state—it is practically nonexistent.

Now, what else did I want to share? I wanted to share some thoughts about the mission in general. You know, as Orthodox Christians, we often think that everything depends on the providence of God. We say that God’s providence decides everything, so if people don’t come to church, it’s because of God’s providence. If they’re not here, it means God is not calling them, they don’t hear His call, and so on. This leads us to believe that no matter what we do, it doesn’t matter—it makes no difference. But this is a big lie, a delusion, and even a mistake. I think it’s even akin to paganism, as some pagans believe in predestination. However, the Lord created us to be creators, to shape reality, to exercise our free will, and to determine what happens in this world through our actions. The Lord’s providence will support us in our good intentions and deeds, but we must take the initiative. If we don’t act, no one will. This is crucial. If we don’t understand this, our lives will be wasted and fruitless, and the Lord will not accept our excuses or logic. He will say that we are fruitless and useless.

Another point I want to share is that, as Orthodox Christians, we often focus on unimportant things. I wanted to say "fake," but sometimes they are real—just not that important. For example, we are concerned about global issues: the world becoming more corrupt, sin increasing, the coming of the Antichrist, control systems, brainwashing, young people drifting away from Christianity, heresies, and so on. All of this is true, but when we dwell on these things, our will is suppressed, and our ability to act for the Church and the mission is undermined. Despite all these global problems, when you go on a mission, you see that some people become Orthodox Christians. Even if just one person becomes Orthodox, it is far more important than all the news we read or the concerns we have about global issues. When you go and do mission work, it brings far more significant results than worrying about these things. People become real Orthodox Christians because you took action. This is the agenda—the most important agenda there can be. Even if it’s just one person, it matters. And it could be hundreds or even thousands if we actively develop the mission. This is another key point I wanted to share with you.

The third point is also very important. With every mission trip I undertake, I discover a clearer appreciation of the fact that the spiritual life of a missionary is connected—perhaps not directly, but significantly—to the outcome of the mission. The normal logic might suggest that if you spend time in prayer or studying the Gospel, you lose time that could have been used for active mission work—distributing pamphlets, organizing events, or engaging with people. On the other hand, there’s the opposite mistake: focusing solely on prayer and fasting while neglecting external mission work, believing that the Lord will bring people without any effort on our part. While this might be the calling for some—such as monastics who serve pilgrims—it is not the case for most of us.

So, how do we find the balance between prayer and active mission work? There are two key links between spiritual life and mission success. The first is easier to understand. When you invest effort into your ascetic life—prayer, fasting, and spiritual discipline—you gain more motivation to go out and do mission work. You develop a clearer mind to speak about Christ and have more spiritual insights to share with others. Through prayer and study of the Bible and the Gospel, you gain a deeper understanding of what it means to have a relationship with God and strive for the Kingdom of Heaven. These discoveries enrich your conversations with the people you meet. Additionally, a disciplined spiritual life often leads to better physical health and focus, enabling you to be more efficient and effective in your mission work.

The second link is more mystical and not immediately evident through human logic. When you dedicate yourself to prayer and cultivate a love for it, the Lord grants you greater success in your mission. He works in miraculous ways, creating situations that help you achieve your mission goals. He sends the right people to the right places, positions you where you need to be, and gives you the right words to say. Why does this happen? First, because a healthy spiritual life fosters humility. The more effort we put into our spiritual life, the humbler we become—provided it is a *right* spiritual life, as some can become prideful instead. When the Lord sees that success in mission work will not make you arrogant or self-important, He is more willing to bless your efforts. He knows that, without Him, you are nothing—worthless on your own. So, He sends success to your mission as a response to your humility and faithfulness.

Moreover, the Lord answers your prayers. When you ask for His help in prayer, He responds in ways that align with His will. By dedicating time to prayer alongside your mission work, you invite His greater blessings and see more fruitful outcomes. This connection is mystical and cannot be fully tracked or measured by human logic, as it rests in the Lord’s hands. Yet, through faith and experience, we can see that it is true.

May the Lord grant you joy, strength, and the boldness to speak about Him, to witness for Him, and to fight against the internal evil that resides in each of us. Amen.

Because without this, we will not be able to do mission work effectively. How can we fight against evil in the world if we do not first confront and overcome the evil within ourselves? This battle arises every single day. May the Lord grant us the strength to be His worthy servants, soldiers, and warriors, so that we may bring glory to His holy name—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Please pray for the mission in Sri Lanka and for all the Orthodox faithful there. And please pray that the Lord may guide you in your daily life to do what is pleasing to Him. Amen. God bless.
