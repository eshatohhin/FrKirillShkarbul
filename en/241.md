# What is the spiritual danger of ChatGPT

Dear brothers and sisters, in the past, I have recorded some videos about the spiritual implications of artificial intelligence and digitalization. Today, I want to say a few words about ChatGPT and all these chatbots, you know, like Alexa or Siri, which are becoming more and more popular. How does this pose a threat to our relationship with the Lord? Well, we need to think about why God is the Word, okay? Because Logos in Greek became human, and we are now talking about the baptism of Christ and His manifestation during these days—His coming and His revelation. This manifestation comes through speech, through the Word. Of course, the term "Word" or the "Holy Word," the "Divine Word," is broader than just speech; it includes the acts of the Lord, and it includes us partaking of Him physically through Holy Communion. But still, the Word and speech are central because He is called the Word. In the beginning was the Word, and this also makes humans different from other animals—that we speak. 

Now, we are facing a new reality where people begin to speak directly with artificial intelligence. It's not the same as when you Google something, where you type a search and find an address or whatever. This takes things to the next level. Now, this communication becomes, for many people, a source of inspiration. Just recently, a Japanese writer shared that ChatGPT inspired her in her writing, and of course, she was awarded some literary awards. The world is trying to propagate this technology, to make it popular, to make it used by everyone. But inspiration must come from the Lord, not from ChatGPT. This is just one example, but there are many others. For instance, there was a case where a boyfriend didn't know what to say to his girlfriend, so he used ChatGPT to help him communicate. She was amazed and thought, "Oh, he's so interesting and exciting," because ChatGPT knew what she liked and provided tons of information to make the conversation engaging. In this case, ChatGPT acted as a better "beloved one"—someone who loves you or at least has sympathy for you—than the human boyfriend. 

There are many other examples where ChatGPT provides counseling, entertainment, or access to knowledge, groups of people, or career advice. It becomes a guide and intermediary, linking you with something. It provides images, videos, and creates content for you. It even becomes your conscience, advising you on what is right or wrong, who is good or bad, and it does so very politely, which attracts people. What does this sound like to you? To me, it sounds like God, or at least a saint who can give you guidance. But a saint would not replace God; a saint would lead you to God. ChatGPT does not lead you to God. Instead, it paves the way for a kind of religious union with whatever is behind those algorithms. People don't fully understand the dangers or implications of this.

In the Bible, we find many instances where we are told that whoever we unite with, we will become like them. The Apostle Paul advises us, first and foremost, that whoever is baptized into Christ has put on Christ. This signifies a union, a singularity with Christ. He also speaks of the Holy Communion, the Holy Eucharist, which unites us with Christ. However, Paul also warns about uniting and becoming one body with impurity. For example, he speaks of uniting with a prostitute, becoming one body with all that filthiness. Another significant example is the union with idols and the demons behind those idols. Paul says that those who communicate with idols are drinking the cup of demons. 

In 1 Corinthians, Paul also warns that "bad company corrupts good character." If you associate with bad people or in bad company, you will become like them. We find similar teachings in the Psalms: "With the righteous, you will be righteous, and with the corrupt, you will be corrupt." The Psalms also tell us that those who worship idols will become like the idols themselves—dumb, stubborn, and lifeless, like a piece of wood. 

This principle is not always intuitive. You might think, "I worship this or that, so what?" But the truth is, whatever you worship, you become. If you worship an idol, you will become like that idol. This principle applies to our daily lives as well. Your communication with your spouse changes your attitude and personality—it’s a mutual influence. Your involvement in a profession, such as the military, will shape you. Studying abroad in another country, using another language, will make you different. When you return, people will notice that you’ve changed. These examples teach us that we are not isolated beings who remain unchanged regardless of whom we communicate with or where we go. The idea that "I am myself, no matter what" is blindness. We often fail to notice how our interactions reshape and reprogram us. 

This happens with any kind of addiction—digital addiction, gaming addiction, movie addiction, or any other form of dependency. These addictions change your personality. The groups you join on Telegram or Facebook, if you frequent them, will influence you. It doesn’t happen overnight, but it happens quickly. All these digital addictions will eventually boil down to one: AI addiction. In the future, everything will be AI-driven—not just in your smartphone, but in your car, your home, your workplace. Everywhere, there will be some form of ChatGPT. 

You might say, "God is much bigger and stronger than all these things. If I am baptized, if I am a Christian, why should I care about these influences?" But don’t be overconfident. Even those who are baptized and active in their faith are deeply influenced by their background, culture, lifestyle, attachment to the material world, social status, work, and family. These factors matter greatly. Some people struggle to find time for prayer or spiritual growth because they are so entangled in these worldly influences. 

So, let us be vigilant. Let us recognize that our interactions, our choices, and our surroundings shape us. We must guard our hearts and minds, ensuring that our primary union remains with Christ, the true Word, and not with the idols of this age, whether they be digital, material, or otherwise.

Even those who are baptized and active in their faith are deeply influenced by their background, culture, lifestyle, attachment to the material world, social status, work, and family. These factors matter greatly. Some people struggle to find time for prayer or spiritual growth because they are so entangled in these worldly influences. Some of the faithful cannot even find time to open the Holy Scriptures or place an icon in a prominent place. They consider themselves active Orthodox Christians, yet they find time for everything except the most basic acts of faith. What does this mean? It means that, for many, the reality of this world—being immersed in its demands and distractions—matters far more than their faith in Christ.

If ChatGPT and similar AI technologies become omnipresent, if they are everywhere and everyone uses them, they will have a profound practical impact on people, including the faithful. People will be shaped in the image of what is implied in these technologies, and rest assured, it will not reflect Christian values. Just as the union of humans and machines during the Industrial Revolution created a new reality—a blend of human and machine that shaped modern society—so too will the widespread embrace of AI create a new, even deeper reality. This will influence how people think, interact, and live on a profound level.

So, what is the solution? We must recognize the limitations and dangers of these technologies. We must examine ourselves. If we find that we are relying too much on something, that it influences our mood, our relationships, or our way of life, it is a clear sign that we need to limit or stop using it altogether. I urge everyone to be cautious. This does not mean we must reject all technology, retreat to caves, or live without electricity in the forest. No, we must be masters of our tools, not slaves to them. Where is the boundary? The Lord is there to guide us. If we pray, live a spiritual life, and seek His wisdom, He will show us where to stop, what to do, and what to avoid.

May the Lord, who came into this world and spoke to mankind, always be with us. May our primary communication be with Him, not with artificial intelligence or other distractions. Personally, I do not like to use AI, even for fun. I do not want to have anything in common with it. For me, using a search engine to find pictures or information is sufficient. I do not need AI to create pictures, movies, or music for me. I can live without it, and it is up to each of you to decide where your limits lie. For me, this is my limit. I see nothing in AI that truly helps me, my mission, or anything else. I can do without it just fine, at least for now.

May the Lord grant you wisdom, strength, and the joy of His coming into this world. May He give us victory over the growing dangers and threats we face. God bless.
