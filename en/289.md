# We forget that Christmas means Nativity of Christ

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas!  
The Holy Church celebrates Christmas on January 7th, and before Christmas, we have five days of pre-celebration. From January 2nd to January 6th, we celebrate, but not yet fully. This period is like the expectation of the Lord's coming—a very intense expectation. In the same way, for example, Saturday is the anticipation of Sunday, the day of rest and peace, the day of expecting and receiving the eternal day, the day of resurrection, the day of the kingdom to come.  

In this sense, this time is not like Passion Week, with its strict fast. We are fasting during these days, but it is not very strict.  

During these days, let us think deeply: What does it mean for us to have the Lord's coming? Because, more often than not, it is misunderstood, and I will explain what these misunderstandings are and where they come from.  

First of all, let us begin with a verse from the Apostle Paul, Romans 13:11–12:  
*"And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light."*  

The day is at hand—it is coming, it is near, it is beginning. We are now standing right in front of this day because the day is Christ. His coming brings us Him. The most important thing is not that He brings peace to the world, some truth, or harmony. No, He Himself is the greatest good of everything. He is the good, He is the life, He is the salvation. It is not that He brings salvation—no, He *is* salvation. So, brothers and sisters, let us think deeply about what this means.  

If we want to be children of light, if we want to be those who listen to what the Apostle Paul has said, we must understand this: The world was in darkness, but now we see that the night is over, and the day has come. What is this night? Because now, we still experience this night all around us—yes, even within us. In many ways, we are still in the night.

Before Christ's coming, we had all these nations that practiced polytheism—worshiping many gods and engaging in idolatry. Over time, idolatry slowly developed into pantheism, where God is seen as permeating everything, emanating Himself throughout the universe. These thinkers, pondering deeply, dissolved God into the entirety of creation, leading to pantheism. And from pantheism, what do we get? We get materialism, atheism, and even satanism. All of these stem from pantheism.  

Even the Jews, who received the revelation of the personal God—a God with whom one could have a personal dialogue—found it unthinkable that there could be one transcendent God who is also personal and engages in a one-on-one relationship with humanity. This understanding could only come through revelation, which was given to the people of Israel. However, when the Lord came, He declared that He came to save the "dead sons of Abraham," the "dead sons and daughters of Israel." Why were they dead? They were dead because of their alienation from God.  

Where did this alienation come from? It came from pantheism, which originated in Persia, and from deism, which also came from Persia. Deism teaches that God created the world but remains distant, uninvolved in daily life. For 400 years, there were no true prophets—only false ones—and the people of Israel lived under the influence of deism and mammonism, which is essentially atheism. In this worldview, God is absent from daily life, and the only "gods" are money, wealth, comfort, and enjoyment. This gave rise to the Sadducees and Herodians, who expected a false messiah.  

Now, let’s come to our times. These ideologies have not disappeared. Today, we see two basic attitudes toward Christmas: some people want Christmas but for the wrong reasons, and others reject Christmas altogether.  

Those who reject Christmas outright are atheists, satanists, or adherents of other religions that often boil down to pantheism, atheism, mammonism, or satanism. For example, Hinduism is a form of pantheism, while Buddhism leans toward human worship, where humans believe they can achieve everything on their own, leading to self-worship, atheism, and ultimately satanism.  

On the other hand, those who want Christmas often approach it with misguided attitudes. One such attitude is pantheism, which can manifest in different forms. One form is occultism, where Christmas is seen as a mystical night filled with romanticism, melodies, and the expectation of miracles. This is occultism, which is rooted in pantheism.  

Another attitude is mammonism, which is also a form of pantheism. Mammonism is more practical: during Christmas, people focus on vacations, parties, sales, and business opportunities. For them, Christmas is about buying cheap goods, making money, or simply enjoying a break. This is pure mammonism, where Christmas is valued for material gain and personal enjoyment rather than its true meaning.  

Ultimately, these attitudes—pantheism, mammonism, and occultism—are interconnected and lead to satanism and human worship. Everything that is not rooted in truth becomes intermixed and distorted.

We cannot simply say that one attitude is more prevalent than another; rather, these attitudes are all intermixed. For example, some people practice a form of polytheism, treating Christmas as just one of many occasions to worship different "gods." On Halloween, they might celebrate one thing, on Christmas they worship Jesus, and during Chinese New Year, they might worship a snake or engage in gambling and wish-making. This is polytheism, and in many ways, ecumenism—the blending of different religious practices—is also a form of polytheism, which itself is rooted in pantheism.  

There is also a more serious issue: for many heretics and, unfortunately, even some Orthodox Christians who take their faith seriously, Christmas can become "TASEM." What do I mean by this? They celebrate Christmas because they feel obligated to do so. It’s as if they obey commandments simply because they are supposed to, without any personal connection to God. For them, God created the world, gave laws to Moses, and now remains distant. They celebrate Christmas because it’s tradition—they decorate the church, say special prayers, and follow rituals—but there is no joy of union with Christ, who is born. This is the Pharisee spirit, or the rationalist theologian spirit, and it reduces faith to mere obligation. This attitude, TASEM, is a perversion of the Old Testament faith.  

Do we want to be like that? Is Christmas just about fulfilling obligations? Let us think deeply, brothers and sisters.  

There is another misunderstanding: some perceive Christ as someone who came to bring "goodies"—peace, harmony, truths, or a special way of salvation. They focus on what He brought rather than on Him. This mindset is not much different from the Jews who were waiting for the Antichrist during Christ’s time. They expected someone who would solve their earthly problems, give them power, health, and a comfortable life. This is why they rejected and killed Jesus. Sadly, many of us today fall into the same trap, expecting Christ to solve our earthly problems and make our lives pleasant. In doing so, we remain like the Jews who rejected Him.  

Let us be aware of these spiritual fallacies, brothers and sisters. For us, Christ Himself is the highest good. We do not expect Him to bring us anything other than Himself. We do not approach Him with a list of wishes—praying for this or that to happen or not happen. That is what pagans, deists, and mammonists do. For us, God Himself is enough. We love Him personally—we love Jesus—and His coming into the world is what we celebrate. This is the source of our joy.  

Do not be disheartened by the spiritual desert around us. Many people either misunderstand Christmas or reject it altogether, even while calling themselves Christians. This is the reality of our world. Do not expect the whole world to suddenly become spiritual and love Jesus Christ. Instead, focus on your own relationship with Him. Let us celebrate Christmas with the understanding that Christ Himself is the gift, the joy, and the salvation. He is everything we need.

It is time for us to wake up, as the Apostle Paul says. The day is coming—wake up! We need to wake up spiritually. We must ask Him to open our dead and blind hearts, to see Him, to receive this joy, and to crave Him alone. Let us find peace only in Him.  

May the joy of Christmas and the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is born into this world, be with you, dear brothers and sisters. His birth is not merely a historical event that happened at some point in the past. No, He came, and He is with us. We are in Him, and this is the greatest joy.  

May this truth be so, and may the joy of the Lord, who came into this world and is now with us and in us, remain with us always.  

Merry Christmas, brothers and sisters!
