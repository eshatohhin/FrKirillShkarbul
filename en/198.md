# Mission to Belize “Thy Will Be Done!”

Dear brothers and sisters,  

I have returned to Taiwan, glory be to God. Today, I want to share with you what happened in Belize and my thoughts on the future of the mission there. I must also explain that Orthodox missions are quite different from other missions in that they often defy conventional logic.  

Typically, an Orthodox mission arises in one of two ways. The first is through great motivation or initiative, where someone feels compelled to act despite difficulties, lack of funding, or support. They simply go and do the work, driven by faith and determination. This is rare. The second way is through necessity, such as when Orthodox people are forced to flee their homeland—like during the Soviet era in Russia—and settle in new places. In these new lands, the most active among them begin preaching to the local population, who may know nothing about Orthodoxy.  

This is normal for Orthodox missions. We are not like most Catholic or Protestant missions, which often operate with military-like planning, budgets, and institutional support. Historically, many missions were backed by colonial powers or financed by large funds. In contrast, Orthodox missions are rarely institutionalized. We lack a strong, centralized organization with annual budgets to train and send out missionaries systematically.  

This is not to say we are opposed to such structures. For social work, education, or even book printing, we have established systems. However, for missions—especially in distant countries with no prior Orthodox presence—there is almost no support. This is one reason why Orthodox missionaries are few in number.  

When I went to Belize this time, I had no funding. I even had to borrow money for the tickets. It might have seemed like a thoughtless action, but I felt compelled to go. I believed the Lord had blessed this endeavor, and I trusted in His guidance.  

As I shared last time, it was a miracle to meet one of the three Orthodox people in the entire country just ten minutes after leaving my hotel. The hotel itself was owned by a Taiwanese family, who welcomed me with kindness and hospitality. They provided guidance, support, and everything I needed, which I took as a good sign.  

During my time there, I walked the streets, distributed brochures, talked to people, and prayed with them. Many asked for prayers and blessings, and some even wanted to build friendships. I made connections with many individuals, and overall, I would categorize such missions into three types.  

The first type is in countries where almost no one feels the need for anything. These are often wealthy, saturated societies where people seem content and uninterested in spiritual discussions. Places like Guam or even parts of Mexico fall into this category. Short-term missions in such places often fail, as developing a mission requires years of presence, trust-building, and gradual influence. Taiwan is similar in this regard.  

The second type includes countries where people are open and willing to learn more, like Belize. Here, there is potential for growth, but it still requires time, effort, and divine intervention.  

The third type is where the need is greatest, and people are actively seeking spiritual guidance. These missions often yield the most immediate fruit, but they are also the most challenging.  

In Belize, I did what I could, trusting in God's plan. I am grateful for the opportunities He provided and the connections I made. Let us continue to pray for the growth of the Orthodox mission there and in all places where His light is needed.  

Glory be to God for all things!

In Belize, I had many conversations about faith on the streets. People there are genuinely interested, and I will explain why. There are, of course, countries where missions achieve significant success almost immediately. Naturally, this requires the Lord's blessing, the right timing, and some experience to know what to do and how to do it. In such places, there is a high chance of success, and you might encounter hundreds or even thousands of people—entire tribes, villages, or clans—who are eager to embrace Orthodoxy. They might say, "Tell us what to do, how to believe. We are ready. Let's build a church."  

Belize is not one of those places, but I remain very hopeful. I believe that if I visit multiple times, there is a greater chance of establishing a stronger Orthodox presence. Already, there is a small community of Orthodox believers who are united and eager to pray. They want to invite missionaries and hope that a priest will come soon. This is a good beginning.  

As for the locals, some have expressed interest in becoming Orthodox but feel they lack a spiritual leader. They want someone who can unite them spiritually, not just during scheduled church services but in a more interactive and personal way. They desire a pastor who becomes a friend, offering guidance in their daily lives, praying with them about their needs, and fostering a sense of family. This is why Protestant missions have been quite successful in Belize—they excel in this type of outreach.  

Originally, Belize is a Catholic-majority country, but you rarely see people in church. This might lead one to assume their faith is merely nominal, but that is not entirely accurate. Unlike in some other countries, such as East Timor or Papua New Guinea, where people blend Catholicism with animism or local beliefs, Belizeans do not practice such dual faiths. Instead, they have what I call a "folk faith" in God. They care deeply about faith, prayer, and God, but they do not attend church regularly. Their faith is alive, but it exists on a personal, folk level rather than an institutional, church level.  

This means they are open to discussing Christ, praying, and exploring their faith further. They are willing to change and learn, but they do not see church attendance as essential. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Orthodox missions in Belize. With the right approach—one that emphasizes personal connection, spiritual guidance, and a sense of community—there is great potential to bring them into the fullness of the Orthodox faith.  

Let us pray for the people of Belize and for the growth of the Orthodox mission there. May the Lord guide us in our efforts to share His light and love with those who seek Him.  

Glory be to God for all things!

Belize is a small country with a population of about 400,000 people. It shares borders with Mexico and Guatemala and is close to other Latin American countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama. While it is not an island, Belize feels like a world unto itself. Unlike its Spanish-speaking neighbors, Belizeans speak English, which sets them apart culturally.  

The country has a unique character. After the pandemic, Belize was largely closed off, with little travel in or out. It is not a major tourist destination, nor does it see significant immigration. While there is some communication with the United States, Belize remains a small, self-contained world where people live their lives in relative isolation.  

This isolation makes the presence of the Orthodox Church even more important. In such a close-knit community, where everyone knows everyone else, the absence of an Orthodox Church is deeply felt. If even one Orthodox community were established, word would spread quickly, and many would have the opportunity to learn about Orthodoxy.  

Let us pray for this mission and for the Orthodox believers already in Belize. Many have gone years without receiving Holy Communion and are in desperate need of spiritual support. They need missionaries, prayers, and encouragement. I am hopeful for the future of the Orthodox mission in Belize and believe that, with God's blessing, we can establish a strong presence there.  

May the Lord grant us His blessing and teach us to be faithful witnesses of His faith. May our Christianity be real, alive, and a beacon of hope for those in Belize and beyond. Amen. God bless.
