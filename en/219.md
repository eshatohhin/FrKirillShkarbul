# How to be vigilant Are zombies and demons also awake

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord told his disciples to be vigilant.  
He said that at the end of times, there will be many false prophets and many false christs who will come and deceive many.  
And you must be vigilant because you do not know when your Lord will come.  
He may come at midnight, at the crowing of the cock, or at dawn.  
You do not know, so you must be vigilant.  
And also, when He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane before being captured, He told Peter and the other disciples to be vigilant and not to sleep.  
So this topic of keeping guard, of keeping watch, is very important.  
And it is important to think deeply about what it means.  
Of course, right away, we see that the idea that "believe and you are saved" is just nonsense.  
It is complete nonsense because you can believe and then fall asleep and perhaps never even wake up.  
So, to be vigilant is the goal of spiritual life.  
And there are many different types of being vigilant, of being awake.  
There is even the negative awakenedness, the infernal awakenedness of the demons.  
And there is the awakenedness of the zombies into which many people are converted in our days.  
But before talking about this, I want to say a few words about the concept of being vigilant.  
Because we need to deeply research what the word itself means.  
It is not simply that you are either asleep or awake.  
This meaning of being awake is not that simple.  
To study this, we need to delve deeply into languages.  
We need to look into Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, English, and the Slavic languages.  
Many languages can give us some interesting insights into this concept of being awake.  
Just to name a few, it can also mean to be active and, in some way, even alarmed—in a good sense.  
So, it is being very lively. It is not just being awake but being depressed and not noticing things.  
No, it is being very alive, full of life—life and action.  
It can also mean to pay attention to something, to have your attention focused.  
Another meaning is to guard, to preserve, to keep—for example, to keep commandments, to preserve commandments, to comply with some commandments, or to keep the word.  
The Lord said you must keep His words within yourselves.  
This is the keeping of the word of Christ, of His commandments, of God's mission—holding fast to it.  
That, too, is implied in this word.  
It can also mean to notice something, which is different from attention.  
To notice is to discover. You notice things, what is happening.  
That is why, very often, Christians were called conspirologists and members of secret societies because they were doing many things in secret and talking about things that were not evident to everyone.  
They knew things. So, this ability to notice something slight, something that others do not notice, is also implied in this word.  
And related to this is the idea of finding out, discovering, and learning—extracting some knowledge from the situation, from what is happening, or directly from the Lord.  
What is His will? What is His message to you?  
So, we can say this epistemological meaning—to draw knowledge, to draw some information, some wisdom from things that happen, from your experience, etc.  
And also, to recognize—to recognize whom? To recognize Christ, the people of Christ, the enemies of Christ, the Antichrist, the servants of the Antichrist.  
You remember that He told the Pharisees and scribes, "You recognize the face of the sky. You can tell the weather and things like that, but the signs of the times you do not recognize."  
We must recognize the signs of the times. That, too, is implied in this word.  
And also, to wake up—to wake up yourself or to wake up others. This is also implied in this word.  
It is not just being awake but also waking up. Every day, perhaps, you need to wake up to recognize something, to understand something, to find out something.

So, all of these meanings are related to the word "being vigilant" and staying on guard. This is a great task and a great virtue for a Christian, which is absolutely necessary. That is why Christians have loved vigils since ancient times—those prayers during the night. I won’t talk much about this today, as it is another big and important topic. What does it mean? Why did they do it? How can we do it today? But today’s topic is not that. Today’s topic is: what is the right vigilance, and what is the fake and false vigilance?  

In terms of the right vigilance, it can also have many different dimensions. We could talk about them, but today, let me simplify it and generalize it into two types of vigilance that we need.  

The first type is very basic. We can call it "worldly vigilance." Even though it is basic, most people today are losing it, which is scary. What is it? It is having conscious awareness of what is happening. This is another important point—the relationship between vigilance and consciousness, vigilance and conscience, and vigilance and conscientiousness. These are all important topics to discuss.  

Let’s talk about conscience. Currently, the mainstream view in anthropology, philosophy, and science in general is to eliminate conscience. They claim it is not possible—there is no free will, there is no conscience. Humans are just actors driven by impulses, a flow of reactions to the external world. This is called behaviorism or physicalism. This is also a big topic to discuss.  

These trends lead us to perceive human beings as mere animals. They live according to and are completely determined by economic factors, biological factors, and physical parameters. These things completely determine who you are. Your thoughts, your imagination—everything is just neurons in your brain, and that’s it. There is nothing spiritual, there is no self. We have seen this in Buddhism for thousands of years already, so it is not something new.

This is reductionism—reducing humans to basic physiological and psychological agents. People truly lose conscience. They become part of a herd where, if everybody runs, you run. If everybody says something, you say it. There are some strata: these people support Democrats, those support Republicans, but they think in a very programmable way. You can make a model of them. Why is this important? Because they can model society, predict behavior, control, and brainwash everyone so much that people will enjoy this lifestyle. They become slaves, robots, animals—they don’t need conscience. They become zombies, and this is where we are. This kind of world is much closer than you think.  

So, this is the basic vigilance we need. Vigilance is: are you awake? Do you understand? No, this is all fake, this is all illusion, this is brainwashing. Some people discover this after stopping the excessive use of gadgets, watching movies, and other things. You live in your information bubble. They give you stuff you like, and you think that’s the whole reality. Everything that contradicts it, you reject or cancel—it doesn’t exist for you. This is something very basic. If we don’t have this vigilance, we cannot talk about spiritual vigilance, which is the goal.  

To have spiritual vigilance, of course, we need to understand who we are, where we are going, and that we have responsibility, a mission, and a task in this life. Why don’t people want to create families and have children? Because they don’t want responsibility, and they don’t understand what sin is. They don’t want the concept of sin because there is no conscience and no consciousness. If you don’t have consciousness, you won’t have conscience. It’s just some fake dogma: there is no conscience—just do whatever you feel like doing, whatever your body says. You become a slave of the flesh, as the Apostle Paul tells us. They want to make everyone slaves of the flesh, but we want to become slaves of the Spirit, servants of the Spirit, ministers of Christ.  

To achieve this, we need to gain personal vigilance, and then we need to gain true vigilance. True vigilance comes from spiritual life: asceticism, prayer, the Word of God, the Holy Gospel, Holy Communion, the Holy Sacraments, and having protection against all the garbage they want to throw into our hearts. We must get it out of our conscience and subconsciousness. Step by step, our spiritual eyes will open, and we will learn how to be spiritually vigilant. This is not an easy task and can only be accomplished with the grace of God.

Having said this, these are the basic frameworks I’m discussing today—I’m not going into the details. We can also discover that there is a negative vigilance, or diabolical vigilance—what I call "zombie vigilance." What is it? There are two types.  

The first is **zombie vigilance**, where you are vigilant as a slave of mammon, riches, fake goals, career, or other passions and desires. You become very vigilant about these things. For example, if you’re playing the stock market, you’re completely immersed in the world of money. That’s all you care about. You’re possessed by speculation in the market. You have to be vigilant—you have to watch what’s happening all the time, read news, do analysis, and make models. You’re completely immersed, and you have to be vigilant. But that’s a different kind of vigilance. Zombies are not asleep; zombies can be very active and very much awake, but in a different sense.  

Then there is **diabolical vigilance**, or infernal vigilance. The devil himself is never asleep—24 hours a day, he is awake. People who serve demons, who are moved by demons, are also vigilant. For example, if you live in sin—say, you’re a thief who harms people and serves the devil—you have to be vigilant. You have to always watch: who left their back open? Who isn’t paying attention? You grasp that thing, you steal it. Or, say, you want to grow your sect. You seduce people so they’ll bring money to you, and you brainwash them. You have to be vigilant—always watching for people who might slip into the net of your sect. That’s what they do, seducing people through the internet, TV, and other means. They have to be vigilant 24 hours a day, putting all their time and energy into it. Later, to control all the people, they have to watch them 24 hours a day. That’s also being vigilant, but it comes from the devil. The goal is to enslave people, to deprive them of their rights, their property, and eventually their hearts and souls—to take possession of their souls.  

This diabolical vigilance is also out there, and we should not mix it all together. We should know that it’s a completely different thing. If you’re a servant of the devil, you cannot be awake in terms of serving Christ at the same time. Please think about this.  

Zombies don’t have consciousness, they don’t have a conscience, and they don’t have moral values. They don’t serve the Lord, but they are vigilant in some way. Let us not mix this together. Let us not become enslaved by this world or become living corpses—zombies. The Lord said, “Let the dead bury their own dead.” The “dead” here refers to those who are alive but are zombies. You can be a zombie, and many people become zombies in two senses.  

If you’re aware of digital enslavement, you’re conscious, you’re vigilant—but that’s not enough. If you don’t live for Christ, if you don’t love Christ, if you don’t hear His message, you’re still a zombie. It’s just a different type of zombie—maybe not as bad, but it still won’t take you to heaven or salvation. However, this is the right direction. It’s a good direction. At least you can make a decision and take upon yourself the mission and responsibility of becoming a servant of God.  

Let us see through all the deceptions that exist. Let us avoid any deception, any laziness, any sleep. Our fallen self always tends toward resting, relaxing, and falling asleep. Let us not allow that. We are servants of Christ, warriors of Christ—and a warrior cannot be asleep. Let us learn how to be awake, how to be vigilant.

especially how to be spiritually vigilant. May the Lord help you and grant you His rich blessings. Amen.
