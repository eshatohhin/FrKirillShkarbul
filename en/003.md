# Can we get infected while receiving the Holy Communion

Dear friends, just yesterday, one of our American parishioners asked me about the religious situation in Russia over the past few months. He mentioned that it might be of interest to many people, both in Russia and in other countries, and I believe it is quite relevant to everyone, whether Orthodox or non-Orthodox.

To answer his question, I need to address several topics. The first topic to discuss is whether we can get infected in church, particularly while receiving Holy Communion, as many issues stem from this question. There is some disagreement within the church regarding this matter, so let us first clarify the correct stance.

There are two primary positions on this issue. The first is a fundamentalist view, with some radical fundamentalists asserting that it is impossible to get infected while receiving Holy Communion. They argue that the body of Christ heals us, and it is a miracle we must receive with faith, without fear. Some even claim that one cannot get infected in church at all, as everything is holy, God is present, and He would not allow anything harmful to happen. While there is some truth to this position, it is not entirely accurate, as many people have indeed been infected in churches. It is difficult to determine precisely whether someone was infected during Holy Communion, while kissing the chalice, or afterward. We will revisit this point shortly.

The second position is the exact opposite. Some within the church argue that people can indeed get infected, and there is no special protection against infection in church. They believe the risk is the same as in any other public place. This is a more liberal view, and some people do hold this perspective.

So, where does the truth lie? As always, it is somewhere in the middle. The fundamental question we must ask ourselves is whether we are in Christ and with Christ. If we are, then nothing can harm us—neither in church nor elsewhere—unless God permits it. Additionally, if we are truly in Christ, we should be prepared to face death at any moment without fear. However, this level of faith is sadly not the case for most of us most of the time.

We recall Christ's words that if we drink anything poisonous, it will not harm us, and we can handle poisonous snakes without injury. But He was speaking to His disciples, who had complete faith and performed miracles, such as healing the sick and raising the dead—things we do not do today. Therefore, most of us, if not all of us, cannot be certain that we are fully in Christ and that our faith is unwavering. This is especially true for church leaders, who must decide whether people should attend church or stay home. They cannot be sure that everyone who comes to church is in such a state of mature faith.

Another important consideration is that it is possible to get infected while receiving Holy Communion, and acknowledging this does not indicate a lack of faith. This is not a liberal statement but a realistic one.

Let us consider this further. During the time of the Apostle Paul, many who received Holy Communion fell ill, and some even died. Paul writes to them, explaining that this happened because they approached the sacrament without proper preparation and the right state of mind. They received it to their own condemnation, which is why they became sick and died. This shows that when we approach Holy Communion with the wrong mindset—without deep repentance, understanding, and reverence—it can harm us, leading to illness or even death, regardless of the presence of something like the coronavirus.

There are three primary reasons why someone might fall ill or die while receiving Holy Communion. The first is approaching the sacrament with an improper state of mind—without repentance, reverence, or understanding of its sacred nature. The second reason is fear. Even if one is in the right state of heart and takes the sacrament seriously, fear of the coronavirus or of becoming ill while receiving Communion (such as through the shared spoon) can lead to negative consequences. In such cases, the Lord may allow illness to occur to challenge and transform that fear. If we prioritize our physical health over our spiritual union with Christ and eternal life, the Lord may permit us to face the very thing we fear, prompting us to reevaluate our priorities.

The third reason is a test of faith. Even if we approach Holy Communion with strong faith, unafraid of the coronavirus or any other threat, the Lord may still allow us to become infected. Why? To test and strengthen our faith. He wants to see if, even in the face of illness or suffering, we remain steadfast in our trust and loyalty to Him. If we endure such trials with unwavering faith, it becomes a means for our spiritual growth, deepening our trust in God regardless of circumstances.

Therefore, we should not be afraid of the possibility of becoming ill while receiving Holy Communion. Instead, we must take all necessary precautions—both as clergy and as faithful participants. This is not a lack of faith but a responsible and faithful approach. Neither the fundamentalist position (which denies any risk) nor the liberal position (which prioritizes physical safety over spiritual life) is entirely correct. The liberal stance is flawed because it suggests avoiding church and Communion altogether, placing earthly life and health above our union with Christ and eternal life. For a mature Christian, the coronavirus should not deter them from attending liturgy, receiving Holy Communion, or being present in church on Sundays. The only influence it should have is in encouraging us to take precautions and to approach the sacrament with deep faith, repentance, and preparation.

Our decision to participate in the sacraments must be unconditional. If the Lord allows illness or even death to occur, it is for a purpose—whether to test our faith, transform our fears, or draw us closer to Him. Even in such circumstances, we must trust that it is not mere misfortune but part of God’s greater plan. If we place our hope in the Lord, we understand that nothing happens outside His will, and even suffering can serve a higher purpose in our spiritual journey.

Indeed, if the Lord were to allow someone’s life to end, it would be the greatest gift—a mature union with Christ, as the Lord receives their soul. Therefore, we must not fear the coronavirus or any disease or death. As Christians, our only fear should be sin—breaking away from God. We are not afraid of illness, suffering, or even death, but we are cautious. The Lord Himself instructed us to be cautious of people who might harm us or lead us into trials, but He also told us not to be afraid. Caution and fear are not the same. We must exercise wisdom and prudence without letting fear dominate our hearts.

This understanding is crucial when it comes to attending church and receiving Holy Communion. Closing churches during the pandemic is a mistake. Historically, during times of plague or disaster, Christians have gathered to pray even more fervently. For example, during the time of St. Gregory the Theologian, processions and public prayers increased, even though some people died during these gatherings. Yet, their collective prayers contributed to the end of the plague, resulting in fewer deaths overall. Prayer, especially during times of trial, persecution, or divine chastisement, is essential. Closing churches and discouraging communal prayer can create confusion and weaken the faith of God’s people, especially if the reasoning is not clearly explained.

However, it is equally mistaken to deny the existence of the virus or to disregard all precautions, claiming that taking measures shows a lack of faith or betrays Christ. This radical position is immature and destructive. It is akin to tempting God, demanding miracles for our sake. We are not called to test the Lord in this way. If precautions are available to protect ourselves and others, we should take them. This is not a lack of faith but an act of responsibility and love. Just as we would take steps to avoid harm during a natural disaster, we should do the same during a pandemic.

Therefore, let us approach this situation with mature faith—free from fear but full of wisdom. We must neither close churches out of fear nor ignore the reality of the virus out of presumption. Instead, we should continue to gather for prayer and the sacraments, taking all necessary precautions while trusting in God’s providence. This balanced approach will help us navigate the challenges posed by the coronavirus, which has become a stumbling block for many. May God grant us strong faith, good health, and the wisdom to respond to this trial with courage and love. God bless.
