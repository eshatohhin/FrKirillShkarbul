# Conflicts in the Church - why

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about conflicts and conflicting situations within the Church among Christians.  
We remember that even the apostles had conflicts. Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul, for example, had different visions about how to interact with Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians.  
Of course, there were also numerous conflicts among the holy fathers, other saints, and even people who were very close to God. They, too, held very different opinions about certain matters.  
We should not assume that just because someone is a Christian, a priest, a bishop, or even a patriarch, everything they say comes directly from God.  
All of us bring a lot of personal background—our upbringing, education, political views, and more—into our perspectives.  
This often leads to conflicts. And since we are far from being saints or holy, conflicts within the Church are even more frequent than we might expect.  
We hope for peace and unity of mind, but in practice, this is not always the case.  
A recent example is the conflict that arose in many countries over the coronavirus pandemic.  
Some church members argued that churches should not be closed, while others believed they should be, emphasizing the need to care for people’s health. This issue sparked many disagreements.  
In such situations, we must be wise. The first thing we should do when we encounter a conflict or difference of opinion within the Church is not to take sides immediately.  
Often, we are passionate and quick to argue, favoring the idea that aligns with our own vision.  
This leads us into struggles, conflicts, and debates, which is precisely the problem.  
The devil seeks to divide the Church, to pit Christians against one another, weakening us so that the Church as a whole cannot fulfill its mission of bringing people closer to God.  
This division pleases him. As Christians, we must learn to control our emotions and passions, avoiding drastic shifts in our attitudes.  
Today, we may feel positive because the weather is nice, but tomorrow, we may fall into depression or negativity. We need to remain rooted in Christ.  
When we are rooted in Christ—through the Gospel, prayer, and fasting—we become more stable.  
This path leads us toward being passionless, not in the sense of being indifferent, but in the sense of being free from destructive passions.  
This does not mean we should lack fervor or become apathetic. The Greek concept of being passionless refers to being untroubled by external circumstances and maintaining inner stability.  
For us, the goal is not indifference but stability and sobriety, enabling us to make decisions guided by the Lord.  
This is a crucial principle. Another important principle is not to rely too heavily on any one person’s opinion, whether it comes from a theologian, a respected priest, a bishop, an elder, or even a patriarch.  
We should consider multiple perspectives, reflect on them, and pray about them, especially when dealing with important matters.  
We should avoid making definitive statements unless we are confident they align with the Gospel.  
Even when we are convinced that a particular opinion is correct, our greater priority must always be to preserve peace within the Church.  
If we see two or more people in conflict, our first response should be to seek peace. As the Beatitudes remind us, “Blessed are the peacemakers” (Matthew 5:9). It is not the role of institutions like the United Nations but of individuals within the Church to bring peace.

And first and foremost, we need to have peace within the Church. So if there are different positions and people are struggling, we step back and say, "Brothers and sisters, let us calm down and pray."  
When we pray, we humble ourselves before God, acknowledging that we need His help and wisdom. This act of humility pleases God.  
God is pleased when we do not insist on our own agenda, driven by ego, pride, or the belief that we know better, are smarter, or more spiritual. Instead, we place ourselves below Him, seeking His guidance and wisdom through prayer. Only after this do we return to the discussion.  
We must also study more deeply and thoroughly understand the background of any issue, such as the coronavirus situation. We should research how the Holy Fathers and the Church historically addressed similar challenges.  
Only after thorough study and reflection can we return to the discussion with greater clarity and wisdom.  
Let us be wise, humble, and always rooted in Christ.  
Let us be fervent in faith but cautious in taking positions or pushing our own ideas, decisions, thoughts, or preferences. If we do this, the Lord will help us, and His wisdom and Spirit will guide us.
