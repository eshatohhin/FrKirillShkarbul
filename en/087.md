# Without Mission degenerate world is inevitable

Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated the memory of all the saints of the church, who were the fruits of Pentecost, of the coming down of the Holy Spirit. Today, we enter into the great fasting of the apostles, the St. Peter's fast. This year, it will last about two weeks, and during this time, we will strive to follow in the footsteps of the apostles and those saints, so that we may better serve our Lord Jesus Christ day by day.

Today, I am in Guam, which is a mission field. In my next video, I will share more about Guam and the mission work here. For now, I want to discuss what it means to become a saint in terms of what we avoid by choosing salvation and Jesus Christ. Some people say, "I don't know when I will die, and it seems far away, so why should I worry about my salvation now?" The problem is that salvation is a present reality. From what are we saved? This is what I want to address.

We are saved from the devil and from destruction. This destruction is more specific than we might think—it is very concrete, not abstract. The whole world is on a path of self-destruction. With the "great reset" happening now, many are wondering what the future will look like. Will it be a new dystopian world? Will there be a powerful elite controlling everything, leading to a cyberpunk-like society where people own nothing and are treated as mere resources? There are many theories about the future, and we can analyze them from social, political, and economic perspectives. Today, however, I want to focus on the spiritual and psychological aspects.

The devil wants people to be destroyed. When he cannot make us rush headlong into destruction, like the pigs that rushed into the sea and perished, he at least tries to make us psychologically unstable, to harm ourselves. This can be described as corruption—mental, psychological, and spiritual. It can also be called retardation, not just in a mental sense, but in many ways. It is a form of degeneration. A person becomes perverted, their personality destroyed, their mind twisted, and their soul fractured. Some say that the computers we use, the social networks, and other technologies are hacking our minds. Our minds are being hacked, leading to a kind of retardation.

We need to be humble enough to admit, "I am myself retarded. I am myself perverted and corrupted." If we have the courage and humility to acknowledge this, we can begin to find a way out. We will see that this retardation, this perversion, this degeneration, is present in everyone to some degree. It manifests differently in each person, but we all have it. This is the result of the devil dragging us in that direction.

Typically, we think of a person as growing, developing, learning new things, becoming smarter, more experienced, and progressing. But in reality, compared to young children—who are often more honest, sincere, and less selfish—we see that as we grow older, we become more evil. We become quicker to anger, more concerned about money, more stingy, and more egotistical. We also become mentally retarded. Even professors, if they live a relaxed life and neglect their spirituality, can become foolish. Many people with doctorate degrees are, in fact, foolish. There is no depth to their conversations—only trivialities like drinking or other shallow pursuits. Why? Because people become retarded. It is a degenerative corruption that is taking place.

Let us strive to recognize this corruption within ourselves and seek the path of salvation, humility, and spiritual growth, so that we may resist the devil's influence and draw closer to Christ.

And the world that they envision—this new world—well, we must acknowledge that the process of corruption is also occurring within the church. Other confessions and sects are even more retarded and corrupted than the true Church of Christ, but we, too, are not immune to this process. 

In this new world as they see it, the elite and those guiding the world—those influencing and making major decisions—are often occultists and mystics. Many of them serve as instruments of the devil. The projects they develop and the ideals they promote for our future are frequently inspired by the devil. I don’t say this is always the case, but often, based on what we observe in the world—what is promoted, what unfolds in movies, news, and the internet—it is clear that the devil is the great conspirator behind it all. Yet, people comply with his ideas and follow his direction.

What they want to create is essentially a three-tier system, which aligns with the devil’s desires. The elite have their own form of corruption and degradation. Then there are regular people like you and me—most people, who still hold family values—but they experience another form of degradation. Finally, there are those at the margins, pushed into poverty or other hardships, who suffer their own kind of degradation. Today, I want to explore what this degradation looks like so that we can recognize it in our daily lives, in ourselves, and in those around us. This way, we can explain to others exactly what Christ seeks to save us from.

Now, all three segments—the elite, regular people, and the marginalized—experience psychological and spiritual degradation. Let’s start with the elite. They believe they are enlightened. The devil is cunning, and he deceives them into thinking they possess superior knowledge and wisdom. They see themselves as smarter than everyone else, viewing the rest of humanity as mere biomass or animals. They believe they have access to secret knowledge and are the chosen ones who will wield ultimate power. This is, of course, a deception from the devil. That’s why they are drawn to mystical cults, Freemasonry, Kabbalah, and other esoteric practices. They believe they are special, but their so-called enlightenment is fake. How do we know this? Because it is accompanied by sexual perversion. Many in the elite engage in deeply perverse behaviors—pedophilia, sodomy, bestiality, and other abominations. These acts are often glorified as symbols of their supposed superiority, but they are, in fact, marks of their degradation. Such behaviors are directly opposed to God’s will and are reminiscent of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This perversion is a clear sign that their revelations come not from God but from the devil.

As for regular people—those of us without vast resources or wealth—our degradation manifests in different ways. We may not be outrightly crazy, but we struggle with social and psychological abnormalities. Many of us are nervous, quick to anger, or prone to depression. We experience low moods, apathy, and a lack of motivation. Our desires often lead us toward unhealthy habits—excessive TV watching, social media addiction, drinking, smoking, or indulging in sexual immorality. These behaviors are symptoms of our spiritual and psychological degradation. 

The marginalized, those pushed into poverty or other forms of hardship, face their own unique struggles. Their degradation often stems from a lack of resources, opportunities, and hope, leading to despair, addiction, and further moral decline.

In all these cases, the devil’s influence is evident. He seeks to corrupt and degrade humanity at every level, whether through the arrogance and perversion of the elite, the apathy and vices of regular people, or the despair of the marginalized. Recognizing this degradation is the first step toward seeking salvation in Christ. He offers us a way out of this corruption, a path to healing and restoration. Let us strive to understand these forms of degradation, not only in ourselves but in the world around us, so that we may better share the hope and salvation found in Jesus Christ.

We can see that these dependencies—our reliance on things like entertainment, comfort, and fleeting pleasures—slowly erode us day by day if we live without Christ. Often, we don’t notice it because the process is gradual. Over time, we slip further into slavery—the slavery of our passions. We seek a more comfortable life, becoming lazier, more dependent on excitement, fun, and entertainment. If we don’t have God in our lives, if we don’t pray, we lose something vital. Consider this: today, 95% of people don’t pray at all. Compare this to 200-300 years ago, when almost everyone was religious. Even if their beliefs were misguided, people understood the need to pray and communicate with the divine. They felt this spiritual necessity. Today, however, many people live without any spiritual component to their lives. They eat, drink, and seek fulfillment in material things alone. What does this mean? It means humanity is degrading on a massive scale. This is the reality we face.

Another sign of this degradation is the rise of superstitions—belief in astrology, numerology, and other false spiritual practices. When we see these tendencies in ourselves or others, it is a clear indication that we are on a path of spiritual and moral decline. Our religious feelings and ideas become perverted, leading to further corruption. We grow more abnormal, more disconnected from truth, and more susceptible to moral and intellectual decay. Over time, this degradation will deepen, and the majority of people will be pushed into a state of complete moral and spiritual bankruptcy. They will lack any sense of morality, living without purpose or direction, unable to think clearly or make sound decisions. We can already see signs of this in the music, dances, and behaviors of young people. Their actions often resemble those of mindless animals or insects, driven by instinct rather than reason. This lack of intellect and moral grounding is a hallmark of the degradation we are witnessing.

Some describe this future as "cyberpunk," a world dominated by digital realities, computer games, and a dystopian society where people rebel against oppressive systems. But in reality, it won’t be cyberpunk—it will be "cybertrash." People won’t be rebels or revolutionaries; they will simply exist in a state of moral and intellectual decay. This isn’t because people are inherently trash—every person is precious and valuable. Rather, it is the environment, lifestyle, and upbringing that will seek to reduce them to trash. The goal will be to strip them of their dignity, purpose, and humanity. In this cybertrash world, there will be an elite class, a shrinking middle, and a growing mass of people living in spiritual and moral poverty. This is the devil’s vision for the future, a world that could fully materialize in 30-50 years if we continue on this path.

So, what can we do? First, we must be humble enough to acknowledge that we, too, are on the path to becoming cybertrash. We must recognize the danger and say, "I don’t want this. How can I avoid it?" The answer is only through Christ. By turning to Him, we can walk in a different direction—a direction toward holiness, virtue, and spiritual healing. We can help others see the truth and guide them toward this path as well. What is this path? It is the path of the saints, the apostles, and ultimately, Christ Himself. It is a life of prayer, repentance, and virtue. It is a life where we shed not just physical fat but spiritual fat—the weight of sin, laziness, and worldly attachments. We must strive to become champions of Christ, as the Apostle Paul urges us: "Run in such a way as to get the prize" (1 Corinthians 9:24). Our goal should be to receive the crown of life from the Lord.

This must become the central purpose of our lives. We must also help others come to their senses, to see the degradation around them and within them, and to turn toward Christ. Only through Him can we escape the path to cybertrash and walk instead on the path of salvation, healing, and eternal life. Let us run this race with perseverance, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:1-2).

Where are we headed? The world is being pushed in a dangerous direction, especially now with the so-called "great reset." We must be aware of what is happening and actively work to prevent this destructive development. It is only through us—through our faith, prayers, and actions—that Christ can intervene and change the world for the better. May His kingdom come, and may we avoid the traps set before us.

Some people view the Church’s teachings on sin as restrictive, thinking, "The Church tells me I can’t do this or that, making my life difficult." But this perspective misunderstands the nature of sin. Sin is not merely a rule to restrict us; it is a trap set by the devil to ensnare us. When we pray, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one," we are asking God to protect us from these traps. Once we fall into sin, we descend further into corruption and degradation. We become worse, more corrupted, and more distant from God. This is the reality of sin’s destructive power.

The Church does not impose restrictions to make life harder; it warns us of these traps and guides us toward salvation. The Church hopes that we will choose the path of life, not the path of destruction. We are called to rise above the corruption of the world, to receive rescue and salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. May the Lord give us the strength and determination to walk this path, no matter how difficult or challenging it may be. We must keep our eyes fixed on the goal, fueled by our love for Christ, and strive to break free from our old selves. We are called to become new creations in Christ, to follow the path of the saints, and to glorify Him in all we do.

May the Lord help each one of us, granting us His rich blessings and guiding us on this journey of faith. Amen.
