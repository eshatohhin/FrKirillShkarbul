# How to receive the Power of Resurrection in Holy Eucharist

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!  
The Holy Church celebrates Pascha, the Resurrection of Christ, also known as Easter.  
This is why we have so many flowers, especially red flowers, and why the priest is wearing red vestments.  
This represents both the blood that Christ shed for us on the cross and the fire that burns and destroys all sin, error, and death—the fire of God.  
During this time, we experience a very close union with Christ.  
The barrier between heaven and earth is broken, and for 40 days, until the Feast of the Ascension, we will be celebrating Pascha. We will greet each other not with a simple "hello" or "goodbye," but by saying, "Christ is risen!" and responding, "Indeed, He is risen!" or "Truly, He is risen!"  

During this time, I want to speak about the Divine Eucharist, which is the fruit of Christ's Resurrection.  
Very often, we go to church without fully understanding why we celebrate or what we do during the Sunday Divine Liturgy.  
We may understand when we pray for specific things, like asking God for a new job or healing, or when we express gratitude for His blessings.  
We also understand when we receive a blessing for marriage.  
But when it comes to the Divine Liturgy, we often don’t fully grasp its significance.  
Some might even think, "Why should I go to church? I can just pray at home. I don’t understand much of what is said anyway."  
This is a grave mistake because it is only in the church that we are united with Christ, the Resurrected Christ.  
To understand how important this is, we must recognize that after Adam’s fall, we inherited a corrupted nature.  
This corruption pulls us away from God, leading us toward selfishness, sin, and destructive desires.  
But Christ offers us renewed life.  
As the Apostle Paul says, we are already walking in this renewed life.  
If there were no Resurrection, our faith would be in vain—empty and meaningless.  
It is only through the Resurrection that we receive the power to overcome the corruption within us.  
This power destroys the "virus" of corruption like a fire, burning it away and opening the Kingdom of Heaven to us—already now, though not yet fully realized.  
This transformation happens uniquely during the Divine Liturgy and the Divine Eucharist.  
This is where we draw life, salvation, enlightenment, power, renewal, and light.  
The Divine Liturgy is our source of all these gifts.  

Today, I want to explain what happens during the Divine Liturgy and why we often struggle to understand it.  
Many of us think of it as something holy but distant—something the priest does, with the choir chanting beautifully.  
We might feel like mere observers, standing in the corner, thinking, "I am a sinner, unworthy to participate."  
This is a great mistake.  
We must actively engage in every step and every part of the Divine Liturgy.  
Only then can we truly appreciate it and receive the grace that the Lord offers us.  

To better involve yourself in the service, do not be afraid.  
Do not think that you are too unworthy or too "profane" to participate.  
You are a child of God, and you belong in His family.  
Some people consider becoming more actively involved, such as serving as altar boys or helping in the service.  
Others consider becoming chanters to better understand the structure and prayers.  
While these roles are valuable, they are not absolutely necessary.  
What is essential is that we learn more about what is happening during the Liturgy—its structure and meaning.  

Today, I want to simplify this for you.  
I will break the Liturgy into several key parts so that, no matter when you participate, you will have a clearer understanding of where we are and what is happening.  
The Divine Liturgy is composed of two main parts.  
The first part is called the Liturgy of the Word, which centers on the divine Scripture—God’s Word spoken to His people.

The Liturgy of the Word is composed of three main elements:  
1. **Common Prayers**: The entire church prays together for the world, offering praise, singing hymns, and chanting psalms. This marks the beginning of the service.  
2. **Scripture Readings**: Primarily from the New Testament, including the epistles of the holy apostles and the Gospel. The Gospel is the most significant part of this section.  
3. **The Sermon**: The priest delivers a sermon, encouraging the faithful to apply the divine teachings to their daily lives, helping them understand and internalize the message so it touches their hearts.  

This first part of the Liturgy is open to everyone—not only the faithful but also catechumens and all who come to hear God’s message.  

The second part of the Divine Liturgy is the **Liturgy of the Eucharist**, which is the core of the service.  
The word "Eucharist" means "Thanksgiving," and it involves the offering of a sacrifice.  
This sacrifice is not only Christ’s sacrifice on the cross but also our own offering of ourselves—our hearts, lives, and faith.  
Just as the woman who anointed Christ with oil brought her pure gift, the Church brings its clean faith and pure life to God, receiving in return the Resurrected Christ Himself—His body and blood.  
This occurs during Holy Communion.  

The Liturgy of the Eucharist consists of five main elements:  
1. **The Great Entrance**: We bring gifts to God, symbolized by bread and wine. These represent not only the bread and wine but also other offerings, such as donations and commemorative breads for the living and the departed.  
2. **The Anaphora (Oblation)**: This is the offering, where the gifts are brought forward. At this point, the doors of the church are closed, signifying the holiness of this moment. The Anaphora itself has three parts:  
   - **Commemoration (Anamnesis)**: We remember the Last Supper, where Christ established the Eucharist. He fulfilled the Old Testament by becoming the sacrificial Lamb. We recall His words: "This is My body, which is broken for you for the remission of sins," and "This is My blood of the new covenant, shed for you and for many for the remission of sins."  
   - **Invocation of the Holy Spirit (Epiclesis)**: We call upon the Holy Spirit to descend and sanctify the gifts, transforming them into the true body and blood of Jesus Christ.  
3. **Holy Communion**: We receive the sanctified body and blood of Christ, completing the Eucharistic celebration.  

In summary, the Divine Liturgy is a profound and sacred service that unites us with Christ and His Resurrection. By understanding its structure and meaning, we can participate more fully and receive the grace and renewal it offers. It is not merely a ritual to observe but a living encounter with the Resurrected Lord.

Everything else we hear during the Divine Liturgy—whether prayers, hymns, or chants—serves either to prepare us for these five central elements or to express our gratitude for them.  
The main focus, however, remains on these five key moments:  
1. The Great Entrance,  
2. The Anaphora (with its three parts: Commemoration, Invocation of the Holy Spirit, and Holy Communion).  

Keeping this structure in mind will help us participate more meaningfully in the Liturgy.  
We can better understand what is happening at each moment:  
- Are we preparing ourselves through prayer?  
- Are we entering into the commemoration of the Last Supper?  
- Are we calling upon the Holy Spirit to sanctify the gifts?  
- Are we receiving the body and blood of Christ in Holy Communion?  

With this awareness, we can feel as though we are truly present with the Lord at the Last Supper, united with Him and with one another in this sacred act.  

May the Lord bless you, fill you with His joy, and grant you the grace to fully partake in this renewed life and salvation He has given us.  
Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!
