# Mission in Belize

Dear brothers and sisters, I am now in Belize, and I think this will be the only video in English that I will record here. My schedule was very tight—it was a 10-day mission trip, and it was packed. I didn’t really have time to create videos to show you the country because that was not the purpose of my visit. 

This was my first mission trip to Belize, and I felt a deep responsibility to do everything possible to make it successful and to kickstart the mission of the church here. 

I am now at the airport, and my flight is coming very soon. Still, I wanted to record at least one video directly from Belize itself. I can tell you more about Belize in later videos, but this one is specifically about my time here—briefly sharing what happened and my thoughts on the future of the mission.

When I first arrived, the Lord showed me that He is blessing this mission. It was a clear message. In the entire country of Belize, there are only about 20 Orthodox people—Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russian-speaking individuals. Among them, only three adults—three women—are actively engaged in their faith. They truly desire to come to church, pray, and be active parishioners and Christians. There are also their children, but only three adults in the entire country are deeply committed.

When I arrived, I went to my hotel and then walked out to begin the mission. Within 10 minutes, I came across a fruit stand where I met one of these women. This was no coincidence—things like this don’t happen by chance. For me, it was a clear sign. These women were truly craving faith and church life. 

Not long ago, we celebrated the Epiphany, the Baptism of the Lord, on January 19. Here, they had consecrated the water themselves to be part of the church celebration and to have holy water. There is a way for laypeople to consecrate holy water, and they did so because they were truly longing for it. They needed it.

As soon as I arrived, the Lord connected us with them, and we conducted a baptism here. One of the children of another Russian lady was baptized—an eight-year-old boy. We also held a Divine Liturgy, possibly one of the first in this country. Now, we have a small community of faithful. It’s no longer just individuals; they will be celebrating services together. I provided them with everything they need to conduct the Typica service on Sundays and during major feasts. They are preparing for the upcoming Pascha, and it’s truly moving. This is the tangible and visible result of my mission here.

The mission among the locals, the Belizeans, is not easy. Every day, I went on mission walks and spoke with many people about faith. Many asked me to pray for them and to give them blessings. Some even expressed interest in becoming Orthodox, though not all were serious. If I could stay a bit longer—perhaps a few months—I believe a local community could form. However, I cannot stay now; I must go. 

I hope that the seeds that were planted here will grow. I focused particularly on Belizeans and did not travel to other parts of the country, but this is a good start. Many people saw me multiple times, and some are considering the faith. Most people didn’t know what Orthodoxy is or what it means to be Orthodox. A few knew, but very few. Now, we have many inquiries and a lot of interest. I believe this will mature, and eventually, there will be serious individuals among the locals who are truly willing to become Orthodox.

Please pray for this mission in Belize. Many people here are suffering. It’s a poor country, but many are eager to learn more about faith, to pray, and to have a spiritual life.

This place is quite promising in terms of faith. It’s not like some countries where people simply don’t care. Here, many people do care. They suffer and live very difficult lives. Some face social problems—they don’t have work, or they struggle with sickness or other challenges. But I believe the Lord has a plan for them. 

Let us pray for this mission and for its future here. May the light of the true faith, the Orthodox faith, shine brighter and stronger here year after year. If you have any questions or want to know more, please leave a comment, and I will make another video about Belize, about this country, and about my experiences during this mission. There were many interesting moments. 

May the Lord bless you.  
Aniruddha.
