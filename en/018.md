# Nature as a “Book” of Lord’s Revelation. How to read it

Dear friends, today we are going to talk about how this created world is the book of revelation of the Lord.  
We need to change our basic conception and perception of this created world.  
First of all, let us begin with the words of St. Apostle Paul in his epistle to the Romans, chapter 1, verse 20:  
"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead."  
So, the Gentiles are without excuse.  
From this created world, we can see the mighty power of God and His Godhead.  
This is essentially the revelation and the image of the divine kingdom, the kingdom of heaven that we so deeply crave and seek.  
Yet, we often treat it as mere "stuff."  

There are two main misconceptions about this world.  
The first misconception is the modernist, scientific worldview, which sees the world as just matter, mere material stuff.  
We think we can use it however we please, as long as we don’t harm ourselves too much.  
This perspective stems from scholasticism, which divides things into separate categories.  
We consider this a great downfall of theology.  
This view reduces the world to something purely material, devoid of spirituality.  
It is just "stuff" to be used.  

To support this view, some misuse the Bible, particularly the idea that man is to govern the earth.  
While it is true that man is called to govern the earth, as stated in Genesis (which we will read shortly), this does not mean exploiting it without care.  
Rather, it means that God wants man to reflect His love and stewardship over creation.  
We are to love this world as something entrusted to us, as the house God provides for us to live in and learn about the kingdom of heaven.  
This world is epiphanic—it reveals to us the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, but only if we approach it with the right attitude.  

Let us now turn to Genesis, chapter 1, verse 28:  
"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.'"  
This world is entrusted to us.  
The Lord has given us a special role to care for and manage His creation.  
But to do this rightly, we must understand what this world is and where we stand within it.  
This world is the temple of God, and we are part of it.  

The first misconception is treating the world as mere "stuff"—rocks, lumber, and material things.  
This is a wrong and harmful concept.  

The second misconception is the ecological or naturalist view, which elevates nature to an absolute value while diminishing humanity.  
This view sees humans as no different from other creatures, often portraying them as harmful or destructive.  
It is a reaction against modernity and aligns with postmodern or naturalist ideologies, often blending with Eastern philosophies like Taoism or Buddhism.  
This worldview falsely equates humans with "garbage" or mere collections of bacteria, which is deeply anti-Christian.  
It undermines the unique role God has given humanity in His creation.  

Both misconceptions—treating the world as mere material or elevating nature at the expense of humanity—stem from a misunderstanding of our role as stewards of God’s creation.  
We are called to love and care for this world as a reflection of God’s kingdom, not to exploit it or devalue our place within it.

So, what is the right understanding, the right conception?  
The correct understanding, as revealed by the Lord Himself, is that this created world is a school for us.  
It is a place where we learn about divine majesty, divine wisdom, and where we come to appreciate what the kingdom of heaven is like.  
It is a place where we walk toward the kingdom of heaven while managing and stewarding this universe.  
We are to rely on its resources and forces—for example, to build planes or other tools—but this reliance is not mere exploitation.  

To illustrate, think of a family. In a family, we help and support one another.  
Or consider a kingdom: a good king treats his helpers as family.  
He relies on them, but he does not merely use them.  
In the same way, we are to rely on nature, not exploit it.  
We are not to extract benefits solely for selfish enjoyment or pleasure.  
Such an attitude is egoistic, selfish, and hedonistic, turning pleasure into the sole purpose of life.  
This distortion stems from a corrupted human heart and mind, leading us away from the divine purpose of creation.  

This is why, in modern civilization, we often feel disconnected and unfulfilled.  
We have lost touch with nature and its sacredness.  
Modern society has shifted dramatically: few people live in rural areas or work as peasants.  
Urbanization and industrialization have dominated, with factories, machinery, and production taking precedence.  
In this process, we have neglected to appreciate nature as God’s creation.  
This disconnect is reflected in modern art, which has often become ugly and devoid of meaning, as we have lost our connection to the natural world.  

Now, with the rise of the internet and virtual reality, the problem is deepening.  
The younger generation is increasingly absorbed in screens, social media, games, and virtual worlds.  
The next step—virtual reality—threatens to completely detach people from the real world, further alienating them from nature and its divine purpose.  

We must resist this trend.  
We must not allow ourselves to be swept away by these developments.  
Instead, we need to find time to step outside, not just for superficial activities like barbecues, but to truly appreciate nature.  
Perhaps we can discover hidden talents, like painting or writing, inspired by the beauty of creation.  
We must reconnect with the natural world, recognizing it as God’s gift and a reflection of His kingdom.  
This is the path to restoring our spiritual and emotional well-being, aligning ourselves with God’s purpose for us and His creation.

Fishing, woodcutting, or working in nature—these activities allow us to feel connected to creation, rather than sitting all day in an armchair, claiming to be too busy.  
We need to change our mindset and recognize that we can find God not only in church, in front of the cross, or before icons in our rooms—though these are important and good—but also in nature.  
Real spirituality, real power, inspiration, and revelation come from God, and many wise and important lessons can be understood and appreciated through direct contact with nature.  

However, we must avoid the wrong naturalistic idea that elevates nature above humanity.  
Instead, we must see nature as our home, created by God for us.  
We can appreciate His might and generosity—the countless stars, the vast variety of galaxies—all created by Him without limit.  
This is what we can learn through direct contact with creation.  

We must not view nature as mere objects separate from ourselves, as if we are subjects looking at matter.  
Rather, nature is a place where we connect with God, where we enter into dialogue with Him.  
Let us be mindful of this world, avoiding both the mechanistic view that reduces it to mere material and the ecologist view that idolizes nature at the expense of humanity.  
Instead, let us embrace a balanced, biblical perspective, rooted in the teachings of the holy apostles and prophets, who reveal who we are and the purpose of creation.  

May God grant us the heart and ability to appreciate this world, to open the "book" of creation.  
Our eyes, both physical and spiritual, are often blinded, but they must be opened to see God behind and through creation—not as if creation itself is God, as pagans believe, but as an icon or image of God.  
Behind this image, we can see God Himself.  
We are part of this universe, entrusted with a special role by God, and He expects much from each of us.  

May God inspire us and give us the time to reconnect with His creation.  
Let us make the effort, especially now, before winter arrives, to spend time in nature.  
After being confined to our homes due to the coronavirus, we have the opportunity to take trips with our families, to draw closer to God through His creation.  
May God bless us in this endeavor.
