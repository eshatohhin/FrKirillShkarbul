# All kinds of Alienation destroy us

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about a concept that is central to our daily lives. It is not only crucial to our spiritual life, which is of utmost importance, but also to our family life, personal psychological well-being, social interactions, and even the changes we are witnessing in the world. This concept is alienation. There are many forms of alienation, and I hope my discussion today will not be too philosophical. I will try to make it as straightforward as possible because this concept, once understood, is very clear and can be observed everywhere.

What is alienation? At its core, it is the act of distancing, turning away from, or becoming estranged from something or someone you were once close to. This concept is pervasive and can be found in various contexts. For example, in the Bible, we see alienation when the devil falls from heaven, representing the separation of angels from God. Similarly, when Adam and Eve are expelled from paradise, it signifies their alienation from God due to their sin. Alienation often occurs in stages—it begins with sin in the heart, leads to action, and ultimately results in separation.

However, alienation is not always negative. Its nature depends on what you are alienating from. Alienation from God is harmful, but alienation from evil, selfishness, or our old, carnal selves is beneficial. The Lord Himself uses this concept when He says, "Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it." In other words, if we cling to worldly life, we will lose true life with God. But if we choose God, we must abandon worldly attachments for the sake of His gospel. Thus, the concept of alienation is deeply embedded in the gospel itself.

The most significant problem we face is alienation from God, which manifests in various forms. To understand its philosophical roots, we can trace it back to early thinkers and Renaissance philosophers. However, the concept is most famously associated with Karl Marx. Marx discussed how workers are alienated from the products they create, as these products are taken by capitalists, leading to inequality. He believed that a revolution would eventually redistribute these products fairly, overcoming this alienation. While Marx framed it as an economic issue, the idea of alienation has deeper origins.

One of Marx's influences was Moses Hess, a Jewish philosopher who drew from earlier thinkers like Spinoza, Hegel, and the Talmud. Hess introduced the idea that money creates alienation among people, which holds true even today. Money becomes a means to access the external world—goods, services, and even relationships. When everything is monetized, genuine human connections diminish. For instance, if you ask your child to help with chores and they demand payment, the dynamic of your relationship changes. Such transactions create a link, but one that erodes healthier, more meaningful human bonds. This is the essence of alienation—it replaces authentic relationships with transactional ones, ultimately leading to their deterioration.

In conclusion, alienation is a powerful and multifaceted concept that affects our spiritual, personal, and social lives. Understanding it helps us recognize its presence and work toward restoring genuine connections, especially with God and one another.

This is an example, and it holds true. Money is necessary, but we must recognize its inherent properties. The more greedy we become, the more we desire to possess money, the worse our human relationships tend to be. When money becomes the focal point, we lose time for others because, as the saying goes, "time is money." The more wealth we accumulate, the more obsessed we often become with it. While this is not always the case, the risk is real. We can easily become servants of mammon, and mammon has a corrosive effect—it acts like an acid that erodes human relationships. It poisons and destroys.

Alienation can manifest between spouses, often due to money or other earthly concerns. When this happens, people turn away from each other, prioritizing other pursuits over their relationship. They become unwilling to sacrifice time or emotional energy for their partner, leading to further estrangement. 

We also see alienation from culture, particularly in the 20th century and continuing today. For instance, the Chinese no longer dress or live in ways that reflect their traditional culture. The same can be said for Europe, Russia, and other nations. Traditional customs, moral values, and lifestyles are being erased, leaving behind only fragments. Why does this happen? Again, mammon plays a role. When profit becomes the primary goal, cultural heritage loses its significance. In immigrant countries like Canada and the United States, this is especially evident. People often prioritize making money over preserving their cultural identity. While I may be exaggerating slightly, the trend is undeniable.

This leads us to the conclusion that alienation involves distancing, turning away, and often betraying. It can mean betraying one's country, moral values, or even a spouse. In its negative form, alienation is rooted in betrayal. 

We see this dynamic at work even within the church. During Christ's time, many Jews rejected the Messiah because their hearts were set on worldly comforts and mammon rather than salvation. Jesus told them, "You are of your father the devil," even though outwardly they appeared righteous. This was a clear case of alienation from God. Later, in the history of the church, heresies emerged as groups chose to follow their own idols, calling themselves Christians while straying from true Christianity. They were cut off from the church. A significant example is the split of the Roman Church, where a large portion chose to follow the Pope, seeking worldly power and influence rather than remaining loyal to the Holy Spirit and the traditions of the One Holy Church. They rejected the authority of councils, declaring themselves superior. This was a profound alienation.

The alienation continued with the Protestants, who rejected all external authority, further fragmenting the church. Each of these examples illustrates how alienation—whether from God, culture, or relationships—stems from a choice to prioritize something other than what is true and sacred.

This is the mindset of many: "Just me and you, and everyone will decide for themselves what the truth about Christ is and what the gospel means. We don’t care about the Church, tradition, saints, or ascetic practices. Fasting? Self-control? What are you talking about? We just want to call ourselves Christians and believe we’re already saved, no matter what." This is alienation—alienation from the Church, from tradition, and from the spiritual life. Why does this happen? Because of mammon, the desire for prosperity, economic development, and business success. Prayer, monasticism, and self-discipline are dismissed as unnecessary. This is how further alienation occurs.

Even within the Orthodox Church, we see signs of alienation today. I say this not to criticize unfairly but to acknowledge our weaknesses. While the Orthodox Church remains the true Church, preserving the faith, we are not without flaws. One such flaw is the tendency to prioritize form over substance. People focus on externalities: how icons should look, how movements should be performed, how one should dress. They say, "This is how it should be done, and now I’m Orthodox." But what does it all mean? If the heart is not aligned with repentance and spiritual life, these external practices become hollow. This is a significant risk within the Orthodox Church, and we must be vigilant against it.

Moving forward, the 20th century brought about widespread alienation on a global scale. Revolutions, both industrial and political, reshaped societies. In the West, the industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism led to a rejection of traditional values. Monarchies, which symbolized familial authority and respect, were overthrown. People declared, "We don’t need authority. We’ll decide for ourselves what’s convenient and profitable." This was a form of alienation—a betrayal of previous ideals in favor of a new, profit-driven lifestyle.

Technological advancements and capitalism further fueled this alienation. The noble values of the past were discarded in favor of business, factories, and trade. This shift triggered waves of industrial revolutions, from the first to the fourth. I am not against progress, but we must recognize that much of it is driven by mammon. For example, the invention of the dishwasher was motivated not by a desire to create more time for prayer or spiritual reflection but by laziness—a desire to avoid work. People want convenience: push a button, get what they want, and move on, even if what they consume is of poor quality. The motivation behind such progress is often self-serving, not God-seeking.

However, as believers, we can use the products of modern technology without being enslaved by them. We can use these conveniences to serve the Lord more effectively, not to become attached to material possessions or constantly seek more, better, or nicer things. The key is to remain focused on God and use these tools wisely, without letting them dominate our lives. This is how we navigate a world driven by mammon while staying true to our spiritual calling.

Next, we come to the sexual revolution of the 20th century, which represents a profound alienation from traditional values, the commandments of the Lord, and even basic human understanding. Questions like "What is family?" and "What is responsibility?" are dismissed. Why? Because mammon whispers to us that our flesh must indulge, enjoy, and possess whatever it desires. This leads to the objectification of others—using their bodies for pleasure and discarding them afterward. Such behavior strips away responsibility, fractures the soul, and destroys lives. This is the essence of the sexual revolution.

The alienation deepens as society embraces values that contradict natural order, such as the normalization of sodomy. It’s not that everyone must adopt these practices, but society is pressured to accept them as normal. The very concept of gender is distorted, with individuals encouraged to define or change their gender at will. This is another form of alienation—a departure from traditional values and the natural order established by God. These ideas are now taught in schools and promoted everywhere, further alienating society from its moral foundations.

Another significant alienation occurred in socialist countries, where materialism replaced spirituality. People were taught to care only about material well-being, turning away from God and higher values. This, too, is a form of alienation, as it reduces human life to mere physical existence.

Now, we face a new and growing alienation in our time: alienation from reality and from ourselves. Alienation from reality occurs when we escape into virtual worlds—video games, social media, and gadgets. We neglect our families, avoid responsibility, and lose touch with real life. This trend is accelerating with the rise of the metaverse and cyberpunk-like virtual environments, where people immerse themselves in artificial realities, surrendering their freedoms to a new, controlling system.

Alienation from oneself is even more insidious. When we become consumed by virtual identities—avatars, online personas, and digital lives—we forget who we truly are. Our brains are hijacked by an endless flow of information, telling us what to think, what to fear, and what to believe. We become like bees in a hive, mindlessly following the crowd. Our individuality is erased, and we lose the ability to think critically or take responsibility for our own opinions. We become zombies, disconnected from our hearts and minds, driven by external influences.

This alienation is paving the way for transhumanism, where humanity is reduced to mere functions within a larger system. Concepts like "Burning Man" symbolize the destruction of the human essence to create something artificial. In this vision, humans are no longer individuals but programmable entities, stripped of their humanity and reduced to cogs in a machine.

In conclusion, alienation takes many forms—sexual, cultural, technological, and existential. Each form distances us from God, from reality, and from our true selves. As we navigate these challenges, we must remain vigilant, holding fast to our faith, our values, and our humanity. Only by resisting these forces of alienation can we preserve our connection to God and to one another.

You are no longer seen as a unique son or daughter of God, with a soul and a personal path to the Lord. Instead, you become just a fragment of a larger system, a cog in a machine. Many are eager to embrace this new reality, diving headfirst into a world where individuality is erased, and humanity is reduced to a collective function. This is the future we are approaching, and we can already see its beginnings.

Let us be vigilant against all forms of alienation. Each one is an expression of separation—apostasy from the Lord. It begins in the heart, then manifests in life, first on an individual level and later on a societal scale. People start to think and act in ways that distance them from God, and eventually, the entire social order shifts. We saw this in Russia, where decades of life without God culminated in revolution. Churches were destroyed, and people who called themselves Christians proved otherwise by their actions. This is the reality of alienation.

The same pattern is unfolding today. We are already losing much of what connects us to God and to one another. The coming transformation will only make this clearer. I don’t want to make this discussion too long, but I hope I’ve been clear in conveying the urgency of this message. We must remember that, no matter our circumstances or the society we live in, we can turn back to God. We can overcome alienation and apostasy by seeking Him and living not for ourselves but for Him.

Though the world seems complicated, the solution is simple. When we change our hearts and turn to God, we can overcome these destructive, self-destructive processes. The Lord will guide us, heal us, and restore us from the misery and defilement caused by alienation. Every sin—every form of alienation—defiles us, distancing us from the purity of a childlike heart. It complicates us, leading us to deceive, steal, or indulge in gluttony. These sins alienate us from a righteous life.

But we have a choice: to turn back to the Lord and live in His light. May the Lord help us, bless us, and preserve us in His grace. May He grant us the strength to gain life from Him and serve Him every day, no matter the challenges we face. God bless everyone.
