# Is there Salvation in the World If you are rich, poor or a romantic.

Dear brothers and sisters, in my previous two videos, I mentioned how difficult it is to be saved in this Babylon, in this world, with the spirit of Cain both within us and in the world around us. Having realized this problem, this difficulty—perhaps having broken these glasses or at least taken them off for a moment—we can now think more deeply about what we can do to be saved in this world.

Today, I want to share with you a few things that I hope everyone can practice so that we can, in this world, be on a firm path to salvation. It is a heresy to say that salvation is impossible in this world. You do not have to go to a monastery, a desert, or a forest to seek God, though it is indeed easier to reach salvation in such places. If you are in a monastic environment—a healthy monastic environment, away from this world, in a desert, for example—your entire life, from morning till night, revolves around spiritual life, and you are not surrounded by so many temptations. You are surrounded, not exclusively but predominantly, by examples of Christian dedication and prayer in the monks or nuns who share that space with you.

But here, in this world, what can we do? Well, we need to be doubly vigilant—twice as vigilant as we would be in the forest, for instance. And how does this vigilance come about? If everything works against vigilance, how do we become vigilant? I want to offer some advice or perhaps just share my observations regarding three types of faithful people. Now, I am speaking about those who are already disciples of Christ, Orthodox Christians. Primarily, I am addressing Orthodox believers. If you are not yet Orthodox, please consider deeply—and include it in your daily prayers—whether to become Orthodox or not. Just bring it before God in your daily prayers.

So today, before I delve into these three types of people, I want to emphasize that all three types would need four things to stay on this path of salvation. The first is church life, including participation in the Holy Eucharist, confession, and the Divine Liturgy. Strive to grasp as much as you can from the Liturgy—the Word of God, the Spirit of Prayer, and everything that pertains to this way of salvation, this plan of salvation that is revealed to us within the Divine Liturgy. Being in union with the church community through common prayer is essential.

The second is personal spiritual life. This must be at the center of your life. What do I mean by spiritual life? Primarily, it involves the prayer of the heart and the struggle against passions, which is achieved through fasting. Fasting is not merely about food restrictions; it is about learning to overcome all kinds of passions and thoughts, cleansing our hearts of all impurities. This is the essence of spiritual life—reading the Word of God, studying the Holy Fathers, and making spiritual life the cornerstone of your daily existence.

The third and fourth elements concern the fruits of external ministry. First is ministry to others—to the poor and the needy. This does not only mean your family, though that is also supremely important. However, focusing solely on your family risks turning it into idol worship. It becomes an extension of yourself—your "bigger me." Within your family, it is your fortress, the only thing you care about, while everything outside is seen as a hassle or a problem. This is egoism and idol worship, a clan mindset common in the pagan world, and it does not make you a Christian if you care only about your family.

The fourth element is mission. As soon as we cleanse our souls of all impurities through confession, intensive spiritual life, and the daily struggles we endure, we must become witnesses of the love and Word of God, sharing it with those around us. We must carry the love of Christ in our hearts and let it overflow into the lives of others.

These four elements—church life, personal spiritual life, ministry to others, and mission—should become integral parts of our lives, no matter what kind of person you are.

Now, speaking about different types of people, we can make a general distinction—just for reference—and I would categorize one type as "successful people." Successful people are few. What do I mean by successful? You have a stable job, a stable income, a more or less stable family life, good health, and everything is going reasonably well. If you are in this situation—and most people are not—glory to God! However, this situation brings significant risks that we need to be aware of. We must understand how to use this position to glorify God and to benefit our spiritual life and pursuit of salvation.

First and foremost, we must remember to love God with all our strength. Recall the Shema Yisrael: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one." We are the new Israel, and our God is the only God. We are called to love Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. What does it mean to love God with all our strength? It means using all our resources—our possessions, physical strength, knowledge, skills, time, energy, everything—for the ministry of God. Not for our own pleasures, comfort, or self-indulgence, but to glorify God in all that we do, as the Apostle Paul teaches. This is something we must always keep in mind.

For such people, the primary task is ministry to others—to the poor, the weak, and the needy. This is what the Lord expects from you. He has given you health, income, and stability for this purpose. The greatest risk here is the corrupting influence of your abilities, especially financial resources. You can buy this, you can buy that; you can choose from a variety of vacations, products, or luxuries. This kind of abundance corrupts the human soul and stems from the spirit of Babylon. Babylon was about choice—creating a society that offers endless varieties of products and distractions. This abundance diverts your attention away from the will of God and toward questions like, "What should I buy? How should I spend my money? How should I use my free time?" This is the corrupting influence of Babylon, made possible by the resources at your disposal.

We must always remember that everything we possess belongs to God. It is merely entrusted to us, and the Lord is watching how we use it. This abundance can lead to spiritual slothfulness, which is so common in developed countries and among economically stable families—especially among their children. They often grow up not caring about anything, living in a state of apathy. This is what many dream of in retirement: "I have all this free time; I can do whatever I want." But this is slothfulness, and it is a form of apostasy. It is a ministry to Avadon (destruction). You are already in the world of Avadon—still alive, but perishing because you are alienated from God. You have created your own paradise, enjoying your life, but this enjoyment replaces the true joy of the kingdom of heaven that God wants to give you.

This is the greatest risk, and most people fall into it. In the church, they may try to find some consolation, thinking, "It's okay, I deserve this life. I’ll light a candle for God, and everything will be fine." They continue living a materialistic life, detached from true spiritual purpose. This is a grave danger. We must guard against it by remaining vigilant, using our resources for God’s glory, and staying focused on the path of salvation.

The second type of people, who make up the majority of Christians, are the poor. By "poor," I mean those who are constantly struggling with their financial situation. Even if they possess some material goods—perhaps a house with a mortgage, or other bills—they are weighed down by the hardships of life, primarily stemming from economic challenges, but also from family problems, health issues, and other difficulties. Often, these problems arise from our own poor decisions. For example, we might not have needed such a large house or taken on such a heavy mortgage. We don’t need multiple bathrooms, living rooms, or other excesses in our homes. These things are often wasteful, and we become distressed because we are burdened by them. This is just one example; it could apply to anything—how we spend our earnings, or perhaps our lack of effort in studying or finding a good job due to laziness or complacency. However, this is not always the case. Some people are eager to work hard but lack the talents or opportunities, or they face difficult life or family situations that are not their fault. Often, these struggles come from the evil in the world, as the devil seeks to harm Christians especially.

Regardless of the source of these struggles, the first step is repentance, especially if the problems stem from our own mistakes. We must also remember that such situations can bring a special blessing from the Lord. In **Isaiah 9:2-3**, we read that God will give a special mark, a seal, to His people who are distressed and in pain. Similarly, in **Revelation 7:2**, we see that angels will place a special mark—the mark of the cross—on God’s people. This is why the people of God are often portrayed as the poor and oppressed. Blessed are those who are chosen and oppressed for the sake of righteousness. There will always be oppression and enmity from the world and the devil against Christians, so we must be ready to take up our cross. This is what the Christian life is about.

For the majority of us, we must remain strong in the face of oppression. Remember the words of the Psalmist: **"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all" (Psalm 34:19)**. People in such situations often ask me, "How do I pray? I have small children who wake up before me, and I don’t even have time for morning prayer. I’m constantly overwhelmed by the hardships and toils of life. What spiritual life are you talking about? Quietness? I have no quietness in my life. What am I supposed to do?"

To such people, I say this: Your prayer can be much more powerful than the prayers of many monks in monasteries, if you learn to pray from within your struggles. While you work, while you are distressed—whether by family issues or other challenges—you can cry out to the Lord from the depths of your heart: *"Lord, have mercy! Lord, save me! Rescue me! Forgive my sins! Bless the people around me!"* These prayers can be short and simple, but they come from a place of deep sincerity. Whenever you seize a moment, use the Jesus Prayer: *"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."* In this way, even in your distress, you can become a true prayer warrior. By stepping firmly onto the path of life in Christ, you will find refuge and support in the Lord.

In the book of Job, we read that those who are oppressed cry out like the young ravens—hungry and desperate, yet their cries reach the ears of God. Even in your suffering, your prayers are heard. Your struggles, when offered to God with a contrite heart, become a powerful form of spiritual life. So, do not despair. Even in the midst of your hardships, you are walking a path that can lead to salvation, if you remain faithful and turn to God in every moment.

they’re screaming out, and that scream will be heard by God. This is not about Kral; this is about true Christians. Their prayer should not be a mechanical repetition of *"Lord, have mercy"* forty times, as if checking off a task. Instead, it should come from the depths of your heart, directly to the Lord. Cry out, *"Lord, hear my voice! I cry out to You from the depths of my sins, from this darkness of Hades!"* That kind of prayer will be heard, and only that kind of prayer truly matters. Anything else is a waste of time. If your prayer lacks this sincerity, you are merely going through the motions. Of course, you may not immediately make your prayer so powerful, but at least strive for this goal. Do not settle for formal, empty prayers—finish reading, say your prayers, and then move on to watch TV. Never say, *"I don’t have time for prayer."* Prayer is not about time; it is about the heart.

Now, the last type of people is very rare. These are usually introverts—observers, seers, who spend their time contemplating nature, researching, painting, or reading for hours in solitude. They are few in number, and often, they waste their time. Instead of spending hours painting or reading novels like *Anna Karenina* or Shakespeare, they should read the Holy Fathers, go to the forest not to paint but to pray, to observe the beauty of God’s creation—the birds, the trees—and to meet God in that stillness. They should not simply seek to bring home a painting or a finished book but to bring home a deeper connection with God. If you know someone like this—perhaps your children or someone in your community—encourage them not to waste their time. Urge them to dedicate their gifts and solitude to spiritual life. Instead of researching the history of ancient Greece, they could study the *Philokalia* or the lives of the saints and Holy Fathers. Often, such people eventually go to a monastery or become priests, though not always.

What spoils all three types of people—and indeed, about 90% of Christians—is the daily use of gadgets, wasting time diving into the abyss of distraction, what I call *Avadon*. Whether it’s videos, humor, or endless analytics about everything, these things pull us away from God. They are a form of apostasy, a waste of the precious time God has given us. Instead of filling our minds with trivialities, we should fill them with prayer, Scripture, and the wisdom of the Holy Fathers. This is the path to true spiritual life and salvation. Let us not squander the gifts and opportunities God has given us, but use them to glorify Him and draw closer to His kingdom.
