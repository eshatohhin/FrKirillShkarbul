# Sentimental “love” is replacing true Love

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about a topic we don't usually discuss, but as a priest, I feel it is necessary to address it.  
This topic is love. There is a significant problem today: liberal, sentimental love is attempting to replace true Christian love, even within the Church.  
We must learn to distinguish between these forms of love because, by nature, we are easily drawn to that sentimental, superficial love.  
To understand this, we need to examine why this happens and explore the different kinds of love that exist.  

Today, I will not discuss the so-called "dirty" love that some people promote. That is not love at all. It is a perversion, a distortion that replaces true love with something entirely different.  
Instead, I want to focus on the true concepts of love. There are various forms of love, and one of them is natural human love.  
We love our parents, and they love their children. We love our friends, our spouses, and those who have done good to us. We feel a sense of gratitude and affection toward them.  
These types of love are natural to all people, regardless of their religion, because we are created in the image of God. This love is inherent within us.  

However, this natural love is far from perfect. It is not entirely bad, but it requires restoration, upbringing, and rectification when we become Christians.  
Yet, it also contains inherent contradictions with Christian love. We recall the words of Apostle Peter when he said to Jesus, "Lord, do not go to the cross. Let us find another way."  
Jesus responded, "Get behind me, Satan! You are concerned with the things of man, not the things of God."  
Often, this human love focuses on worldly benefits—health, safety, comfort, career success, and the like.  
At times, these concerns can conflict with Christian values. Therefore, we must subject this human love to the higher standard of Christian love.  
We do not reject or destroy it, but we must ensure it is guided and transformed by our faith.  

We will also explore the differences between a mother's love and a father's love, as this will help us better understand the nature of Christian love and God's love for us.  

Then there is sentimental love, which is a surrogate—a fake imitation of true love. It can mimic any form of love, but it lacks depth and authenticity.  
What are the characteristics of this surrogate love, and where does it come from? First, it arises from the need to substitute.  
We live in a cruel world, and we must be honest with ourselves about this. The world is filled with selfishness, where everyone prioritizes their own interests.  
History is marked by civil wars, where brothers killed brothers, not for personal gain but because of ideologies promoted by figures like Lenin or Mao Zedong.  
Entire populations were consumed by such conflicts. We remember the wars between England and France, the First and Second World Wars, and the ongoing conflicts that persist to this day.  

In such a world, when someone says, "I love you just because I love you," we must not be naive enough to believe it is genuine.  
It is often a facade, a superficial expression. I have heard confessions from people who have killed others in civil wars and regional conflicts.  
These are deep wounds that cannot be healed quickly. As a society and as humanity, we carry these wounds, and they are still raw.  
We must not deceive ourselves into thinking that people love one another so easily.  

True love is a miracle, a gift from Christ. Yet, we know that love will grow colder as the end times approach—and we are living in those times.  
Because of the prevalence of sin and pain, genuine love for others is increasingly rare. Let us strive to cultivate and embody the true, selfless love that comes from God.

It is good that we love our relatives and family members as humans. That is already a positive step. However, we must now strive to understand Christian love and how it differs from sentimental love.  

One reason sentimental love arises is that people, seeing the cruelty of the world, react by saying, "No, we need something different." They attempt to create a sense of unity by sharing food, drinks, and superficial gestures, as if to revolt against the selfishness and harshness of the world.  
Yet, without a solid foundation, such a revolt is destined to fail. This reaction can even turn against God, as it accuses Him of being cruel and uncaring.  
It claims that God's laws are too strict, that His commandments restrict our freedom and prevent us from enjoying life. It portrays God as a harsh figure who wants us to suffer, leading people to reject Him and pursue a liberal, self-centered lifestyle.  
This way of life is essentially a rebellion against God, an attempt to escape His authority by painting Him as the "bad guy."  

Another reason for sentimental love is the search for substitutes. When we lack true love, we seek replacements in various areas of life.  
For example, if we are dissatisfied with our church, we might look for another one or even join a sect.  
In family life, conflicts with a spouse might lead us to seek a substitute partner.  
If we are unhappy with our homeland, we might adopt another country as our own.  
In our work, a lack of loyalty might drive us to seek opportunities elsewhere.  
Even in grief, when we lose someone dear, we struggle to find a true substitute, which causes immense pain.  

The root of this issue is the absence of true love and a relationship with God. Without these, we seek substitutes to fill the void and bring temporary peace.  
This is how sentimental love infiltrates the Church—a shallow, external imitation of true love.  

What exactly is sentimental love? Let me explain further.  
First, it is characterized by excessive external displays. For example, giving lavish gifts to a child without genuine care, or performing grand gestures for a partner without true affection.  
It focuses on appearances rather than the heart.  

Second, it involves indulging in one's own emotions. People enjoy the feeling of being "loving" rather than actually loving others.  
They take pride in their actions, saying, "Oh, I gave a present today. I am so loving." This self-centered enjoyment of emotions is a hallmark of sentimental love.  

Third, it is marked by intense anger when things do not go as planned. If a carefully orchestrated display of affection is disrupted, the person becomes furious, even to the point of hostility.  

Fourth, it is narrow-minded and rigid. Sentimental love fixates on one person or one way of doing things, refusing to adapt or grow.  
It is unhealthy and stifling.  

Finally, it rebels against hierarchy and tradition. It seeks to level everything, rejecting respect for parents, social structures, or divine order.  
It promotes the idea that everyone should be equal in every way, dismissing the roles and responsibilities that God has established.  

This is the nature of sentimental love—a shallow, self-serving imitation that infiltrates the Church.  
As 2 Timothy 3:5 warns, such people "have a form of godliness but deny its power." They appear pious but lack the transformative power of true Christian love.  
Let us strive to move beyond sentimental love and embrace the genuine, selfless love that comes from God.

Piety is faith in action—a way of living as a Christian. Those who exhibit sentimental love may appear pious, but their actions lack the power of true faith.  
They play the role of devout believers, even convincing themselves, but their faith is shallow and devoid of transformative power.  

What, then, is the power of true piety? It is expressed through deeds done in faith, motivated by love for Christ and obedience to His commandments.  
If our actions align with these principles, it is evidence that our faith and piety are genuine, not counterfeit.  
Our deeds for Christ serve as a measure of the depth of our faith and piety.  

Today, a troubling spirit has entered the Church, claiming, "We are against cruelty and injustice. We care deeply for people and their well-being, and we must do many things to show it."  
Yet, this is often a facade. We must recognize the falseness of this spirit and the sentimental love it promotes.  

To better understand this, we can draw an analogy between a father's love and a mother's love. Both are good and necessary, and I am not criticizing either.  
Children tend to understand a mother's love more easily because it is nurturing, constant, and tangible.  
A mother ensures her child is fed, healthy, warm, and safe in the present moment. This love is genuine and essential.  

A father's love, on the other hand, is often more focused on the child's future. It is moral and value-oriented, concerned with the kind of person the child will become.  
If a father truly loves his child, his love may not be as visibly expressed in the moment.  
A child may not fully appreciate it until they grow older and realize the wisdom and care behind their father's actions.  

In a similar way, God's love and Christian love embody both maternal and paternal qualities but lean more toward the fatherly aspect.  
This is why we often feel, "Where is God? He isn't helping me. My life is so hard. Does He even care?"  
We misinterpret His actions as cruelty or indifference, when in reality, He is guiding us toward what is eternally good.  

This dynamic is also seen in relationships. For example, a woman may desire constant gestures of affection, like rings or gifts, as proof of love.  
A man, however, may withhold such displays, fearing they will lead to vanity or dependency.  
This can create tension, with the woman feeling unloved and the man feeling misunderstood.  

God, in His wisdom, knows what is truly best for us, even when we cannot see it.  
Similarly, Christian love seeks what is eternally beneficial for others, prioritizing their salvation and spiritual well-being.  
This love requires sacrifice—of time, comfort, and even personal desires. Yet, we must be prepared for the possibility that our love may be rejected or misunderstood.  
This is a painful reality, but it is part of the cost of true Christian love.  

We must learn to discern the difference between sentimental love and genuine Christian love.  
We must value the lessons God teaches us and strive to cultivate a heart that loves as He loves.  
Let us pray for the Lord's guidance on this path, asking for wisdom, patience, and a self-sacrificing heart.  
May He help us to love others not with superficial gestures, but with the deep, enduring love that reflects His own.  

Amen.
