# Divine vs. Luciferian “Enlightenment”

Dear brothers and sisters, the Church is often criticized for obscurantism, for being afraid of certain scientific and technological knowledge, and for not encouraging the faithful to read too many books. We recall the Middle Ages, with the burning of books, the burning of Giordano Bruno, and all these conflicts with science. This image persists to this day—that Church people are conservatives who want you to merely read the Bible, to simply pray, and nothing more. This requires some clarification, especially now that we face a different problem. The criticism I mentioned earlier is modernism, the spirit of rationalism, which claims that the human mind and intellect can understand everything and find answers to all questions. We believe in science, we believe in progress, so we don’t need dogma or anything of that sort. But now we have entered the era of post-modernism—or perhaps post-post-modernism—which is turning off the human mind, the human intellect. It encourages people to act on emotions, to be organic, to be natural, and not to think too much. Essentially, this is where the world is heading: people are being told to turn off their minds, to simply listen to media or bloggers, to embrace the gamification of the world, where everything is just a game. You only need basic skills, and thinking too much is considered bad for you. 

We now have a new generation that is different. They possess narrow knowledge about specific topics, even in school and university. It is no longer encouraged to know a lot or to synthesize information. You only need to specialize in your particular field, and that is deemed sufficient. This represents an eclipse of the human intellect. Of course, some people oppose this trend. They argue that you must use your mind, your brain, and not simply follow the crowd. Think before you act, they say, and don’t become part of a mass or a crowd that rushes blindly into something. Humans must have the ability to think autonomously, without relying on others, to think for themselves. However, there is a risk here. If you rely solely on your mind and intellect, you may slip into significant problems. What kind of problems? You might push God out of your mind. You might reject anything that requires faith. You might doubt everything. You could fall into the modernist trap of believing that your mind is the ultimate measure of all things. 

In the past, this is what happened with Protestantism. They declared, "We don’t need dogma, we don’t need the Catholic Church, we don’t need any authority. We will understand things for ourselves." Each person was to read the Bible and form their own interpretation of Scripture. As a result, the idea of universal truth was lost. Then came rationalism, which claimed that we don’t need the Bible at all—we only need to study nature and science. This was followed by progressivism, and ultimately, people drifted away from faith altogether. Society as a whole became increasingly secular. This shift did not occur because of knowledge or study; it happened because of underlying problems.

We read in the Bible, in 1 Corinthians 1:19, "The Lord said, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.'" For the Lord, true wisdom is different from human wisdom. True knowledge is distinct from human knowledge. St. Clement of Alexandria said that true *gnosis*, true knowledge, comes only through asceticism. Only when you have a real union with the source of truth, with the Lord Himself, can you gain true knowledge, because He is the source of all true knowledge. Without this union with Him, you will fail. You will be misled. You will slip into false knowledge, false logic, and false wisdom. This is why, for example, when the Apostle Paul came to Athens, a place of philosophers, he preached to them with great wisdom and insight into their lives. Yet, not many converted. Only a few were willing to listen about the resurrection and other teachings. However, when he went to villages with peasants, people who had no formal education, they often received his message in great numbers and were eager to follow the path to salvation. 

From ancient times, the majority of the faithful were illiterate, people without much education. Why was this the case? Is education an obstacle? As I mentioned earlier, it is not education itself but the pride that often accompanies it. When you learn something from books, you may begin to think that you understand everything, that you are something special. The Apostle Paul also tells us that knowledge can make you arrogant. This arrogance can become an obstacle to true wisdom. So, what is the solution to this problem? Should we stop using our intellect? Should we blindly follow tradition without question? No. Every ability we have—our intellect, our will, our emotions—is given to us by the Lord. He wants us to use our intellect, but it must be enlightened by Him. Our intellect must be guided by the Lord and by love. It must work in harmony with our heart, which is directed toward Him. 

When this connection is broken, as it was in scholasticism, which took a rationalistic approach to knowledge about God, separating it from spiritual life and faith, it becomes lifeless and irrelevant. This is why such approaches were eventually abandoned. All knowledge about the Lord, about life, and about true philosophy must go hand in hand with our spiritual life, with our journey of following the Lord. It should not be driven by egoistic ambitions, such as wanting to know more than others or using knowledge to manipulate others. This is why the Church is cautious about knowledge. It is not obscurantism. The Church is not against learning, knowledge, or mass education. Rather, it emphasizes that there must be a priority: spiritual life must come first.

Your education, particularly your upbringing in Christ, must be the foundation for all other learning. Only then will you have true understanding of where this knowledge fits and how it should be used. May the Lord grant us this wisdom. May He help us gain the wisdom that comes from above, from heaven, and protect us from being misled by secular, earthly, or biased philosophies and teachings—those influenced by the spirit of the enemy, the spirit of pride, the spirit of corruption, and the worldly spirit. May the Lord help us, grant us His wisdom, teach us His ways, and guide us through every challenge. 

We do need to use our intellect to discern right from wrong, to understand how to live in this world, and to bring the message of Christ to others. We must use our intellect, but we must also approach it with humility, submitting it to the Lord and His guidance. Amen. May the Lord grant you this wisdom. Amen.
