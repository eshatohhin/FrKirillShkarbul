# War in Israel, 3rd Temple and antichrist

Dear brothers and sisters, in recent days, we have heard about the conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip, the bombings of many cities in Israel, and the clashes on the Temple Mount and in other cities between Arabs and Jews. The whole world is watching to see what will happen. While the situation has improved somewhat, concerns remain. There are discussions that, due to these clashes, the two mosques atop the Temple Mount—Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock—may be at risk of demolition or other harm, potentially leading to the construction of a third temple in their place. These mosques are deeply sacred to Muslims, and the tensions have a strong religious dimension.

Although Israel is a small country, it holds significant importance globally. Jerusalem, in particular, is considered the center of the world by many. This conflict has drawn the attention of numerous nations, with people speculating about the reactions of the United States, the Arab world (including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iran), Russia, Turkey, Syria, and others. Israel’s role in global politics is undeniable, but its spiritual significance is equally profound, especially for Christians. The issue of the third temple is particularly relevant, as some interpretations suggest that the Antichrist will be crowned there. This temple, described in scripture, is believed to differ from the first and second temples—the latter of which was destroyed by the Romans in the first century—and is thought to be the third temple. Since the Antichrist has not yet appeared, this remains a topic of deep concern for many Christians, as it ties into end-times prophecies and the book of Revelation.

When reflecting on these events, it is crucial to look beyond the surface-level news and political agendas. Various theories attempt to explain the root causes of this conflict—political, conspiratorial, or even the idea of a "Greater Israel." However, my focus today is not on these theories but on the spiritual implications, particularly the concept of the Antichrist. For Christians, the critical question is not when the Antichrist will come or who he will be, but rather how we can remain spiritually aligned with Christ and avoid being deceived by the Antichrist’s regime.

To understand how to prepare, we must first grasp the spiritual nature of the Antichrist and his role in God’s divine plan. This requires us to reflect on the broader context of God’s will, especially in light of the suffering we witness—whether from war, conflict, or pandemics like COVID-19. Innocent lives, including children, are lost, and it can be difficult to reconcile such tragedies with the idea of a loving and just God. We may wonder why God allows these events to unfold, why He permits bombs to fall and innocent lives to be taken. These questions challenge our faith, but they also remind us of Christ’s teachings. When people came to Jesus and mentioned the collapse of a tower that killed 18 individuals, He responded by urging repentance, emphasizing the need for spiritual readiness.

All of you will perish in the same way. This shows us that if people do not repent, their lives hold little value in the eyes of God. While God does care for them, their lives are not so important that He would prevent a tower from falling or bombs from dropping. There is a direct connection between repentance and the value of one’s life in the Lord’s sight. Jesus also told His disciples that those who believe will have signs accompanying them—such as drinking something poisonous without harm or handling snakes without injury. This demonstrates the relationship between being aligned with God’s plan and the preservation of one’s life, even against natural laws. For example, if you are deeply pleasing to God and integral to His plan, a bomb meant to kill you might be diverted because the Lord says it is not yet your time—He still needs you. Such miracles are signs of being fully incorporated into God’s plan.

However, this level of divine protection is not immediate or universal. Not everyone who drinks poison will survive, nor is everyone shielded from harm. If someone attempts to harm us, and we survive, it may indicate that we are somewhat aligned with God’s plan, but not yet so close to Him that He performs such miracles regularly. Our spiritual journey is a progression toward God, moving closer to Him step by step.

There are three primary ways a person can become unpleasing to God or fall out of His plan. The devil and the Antichrist aim to pull people away from God’s plan, not to help them progress from one level to the next but to cause them to regress and ultimately fall away. The first way this happens is through selfishness—living for oneself, focusing on personal comfort, future, family, property, and plans. Jesus calls us to let go of these things, to abandon our lives for His sake, and to follow Him. The second way is through persistent sin—refusing to repent or change, becoming increasingly entangled in sinful behavior. This separates us from God’s grace, blessing, and protection. The third way is through delusion—being driven by a spirit or motivation that does not come from God. This false inspiration leads us to act impulsively or obsessively, rather than with calm rationality and divine guidance.

These three factors—selfishness, persistent sin, and delusion—can be summarized by one word: **idolatry**. When we prioritize ourselves, our desires, or false inspirations over God, we fall out of His plan and lose His guidance. The goal, then, is to repent, align ourselves with God’s will, and resist the temptations that lead us away from Him.

which is **adultery**—or fornication. Adultery is not limited to carnal acts; it encompasses various forms. One type is spiritual adultery, where we embrace other religions, astrology, yoga, Buddhism, numerology, or other beliefs. This is often represented by modern ecumenism, which appears to promote unity among religions but is, in fact, a form of spiritual adultery. It mimics love but is not genuine. Similarly, intellectual adultery occurs when we adopt conflicting philosophies, existentialist mindsets, or other ideologies that deviate from God’s truth. There is also adultery of values, where we prioritize material well-being, career, hobbies, travel, or other pursuits over God. Adultery can manifest in the mind, heart, or even speech—such as swearing—or on the body, like tattoos, which reflect a departure from God’s design. Sexual adultery is just one form; it can permeate every aspect of life, even in subtle ways like the avatars we choose online, which can reveal inner adulterous tendencies. All of us struggle with some form of adultery, and it is this that distances us from God.

The devil and the Antichrist exploit these tendencies. Just as artificial intelligence analyzes our online behavior—what we search, what we linger on—the devil understands our passions and weaknesses. Historically, armies were weakened by introducing distractions like prostitutes or pornography, knowing that indulgence in such things would make soldiers vulnerable. Similarly, the devil uses all forms of adultery as weapons to conquer people, including Christians. Through big data and modern technology, this control is becoming more pervasive, extending the power of the Antichrist to every individual. This is not merely a spiritual battle but a tangible, incarnate system with infrastructure. The Antichrist will be an incarnate figure, a partner for the devil, just as Christ became incarnate as God in human form. The devil seeks to establish his influence in the world not only through spiritual means but also through physical systems—media, technology, and infrastructure—that can control humanity on a global scale. This is how the kingdom of the Antichrist will be established, blending spiritual deception with physical domination.

Even physically, the systems of control are becoming more advanced, deciding who receives goods and who does not. This growing capability makes it increasingly possible for the Antichrist to exert dominance over the world. What matters most is that through sin—through all forms of adultery—we surrender our freedom. We lose our strength as warriors of Christ and become vulnerable to conquest. This is the direction the world is heading, and it is why the Antichrist will eventually rise to control nearly the entire global population.

We must remain vigilant and guard ourselves against these mechanisms of control, which exploit the adulterous tendencies within us. May the Lord help us cultivate hearts of sacrifice, living for Christ and righteousness. Let us cleanse our hearts of all impurities, passions, and darkness, striving to resist their influence. In doing so, we will become strong and wise soldiers of Christ, fully incorporated into His divine plan. Our lives will hold great value in His eyes, and He will protect and guide us through every challenge and struggle. May the Lord bless each of us and grant us His strength. Christ is risen!
