# Proclaiming the Gospel among Hindus

- Dear brothers and sisters, we are now in Jaffna. This is the largest Hindu temple in all of Sri Lanka.  
- There is a constant sound emanating from this place. Despite it being a Hindu site, we will conduct our mission here.  
- There are already Orthodox families here, and we have decided to send a preacher to this location.  
- A missionary will come every Saturday to carry out the mission, with the hope of converting these people to the Orthodox Christian faith.  
- There are several buildings here, as this is the religious center of Hinduism in Sri Lanka.  
- Please pray for the mission, and may the Lord Jesus Christ be with us. Amen. This is a good place.
