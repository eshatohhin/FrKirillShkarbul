# We are misunderstanding Pascha (Easter)

Dear brothers and sisters, the Great Lent has concluded, and the Holy Church has entered Passion Week. Very soon, we will celebrate Pascha, the Resurrection of Christ. During these Holy Days, it is essential to reflect deeply on the meaning of the Passions. Today, I wish to address a common misunderstanding—a misunderstanding many people have about Easter, about Pascha.

We often criticize, and rightly so, Protestants for their belief in salvation without the Cross, without the Passions. This is because they lack an understanding of asceticism, the struggle to overcome the old self, and they place little emphasis on repentance and suffering. For them, it is already "Alleluia," already "You are saved." This is a profoundly anti-Christian perspective, leading one down a broad path, as I discussed in a previous video. Similarly, we criticize Catholics for overemphasizing Christmas over Easter, as this reflects a worldly mindset. It is easier to comprehend God's coming into this world, blessing it with His presence. However, Easter, Pascha, is about the eternal world, the life to come, and the Resurrection. This is more abstract and less tangible to the carnal, earthly mind, which is why Christmas is emphasized more than Easter in Catholic and Protestant countries.

Within the Orthodox Church, which preserves the true teaching, worship, liturgy, and asceticism, everything remains undistorted. Yet, because people are human, and many do not place serious emphasis on spiritual life, there arises a distorted understanding of Easter, of Pascha, even within the Orthodox Church. So today, I want to clarify: What are we celebrating in Pascha?

The typical answer is the Resurrection of Christ—that He triumphed, overthrew death, and granted us eternal life. We celebrate this with "Alleluias." However, this is only part of the story, the outcome of what the Lord accomplished. The most crucial aspect, what the Lord achieved and what we celebrate in Pascha, in every Divine Liturgy and Eucharist, is the Passion and death of Christ. In the early Church, there was an understanding that Pascha, derived from the Greek verb meaning "to suffer," refers to the suffering of Christ—His Passions. The Resurrection, Anastasis, was the result of these Passions. Therefore, when we celebrate Pascha, we are first and foremost celebrating the Passion and death of Christ.

This understanding is supported by both the Old and New Testaments. For us, the New Testament takes precedence, so let us begin there. In 1 Corinthians 11:20, the Apostle Paul states, "When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat." What does this mean? The Lord's Supper is the Mystical Supper, known in the West as the Last Supper. For us, it is the Mystical Supper that took place on the evening before Christ's Passion—Thursday evening, in our understanding. Thus, the Eucharist is the Mystical Supper, reenacted mystically, allowing us to participate in it once more and become part of this sacred event.

Indeed, Pascha can be understood as the grand mystical supper, for the celebration of this supper in the Church occurs daily, with a more significant observance every Sunday, and the most profound celebration taking place once a year on Pascha. Thus, Pascha represents the pinnacle of this mystical supper. Every Divine Liturgy is directly connected to the mystical supper. What, then, is the essence of the mystical supper? The Lord breaks the bread, which symbolizes His body, and the act of breaking signifies His death. Thus, He speaks of His death. The chalice He shares with His disciples represents His blood, and He declares, "This is My blood." In a mystical sense, it becomes His blood, and blood signifies suffering and death—the pouring out of blood equates to death. Therefore, the mystical supper centers on the Passion and death of Christ, not the Resurrection. The disciples repeated this act continually, and this is what we continue in our Divine Liturgy—the same celebration.

The Apostle Paul, in his critique of the Corinthians, states that by making distinctions among themselves—dividing into rich and poor—they sin against the death of Christ. He does not say they sin against the Resurrection but against His death. Christ died for all on the cross, meaning all are equal in His sacrifice. To discriminate or create divisions is to sin against His death. This underscores that the celebration of the Eucharist, partaking of the body of Christ, is fundamentally a celebration of His death. This may sound strange and is often misunderstood. Why celebrate death? Let us delve deeper.

In the Mystical Supper, the Lord draws upon the Old Testament Pesach. The Old Testament Pesach, meaning "to pass over," was prophetic, symbolizing Israel's deliverance from Egypt through the Red Sea, their liberation from slavery, and the drowning of Pharaoh in the waters. This passage, this escape, was celebrated during Pesach in the Old Testament. The Lord reinterprets this, declaring that now, what delivers humanity from sin to freedom, from death to life, is His suffering and death. This is what would occur on the cross the following day. In the Eucharist, Christ is sacrificed—again, His death is central.

If further clarification is needed, consider the Holy Martyrs. How do we celebrate them? We commemorate them on the day of their death, for that day was their triumph, their greatest day. They faced their execution with dignity, even joy, as if stepping onto a stage for a grand celebration. For them, death was glory. Similarly, for the Lord, His glory was on the cross, the moment He gave His life for humanity. Through His self-sacrifice and death, He overthrew evil. This is His glory, and we celebrate it through His Passion and death on the cross. This is the heart of Pascha.

It is not, as many might think, that Passion Week is merely a time of strict fasting in preparation for Pascha. Rather, it is a profound engagement with the mystery of Christ's suffering and death, which lies at the core of Pascha. The Resurrection, while glorious, is the outcome of His Passion. Thus, in celebrating Pascha, we first and foremost honor His sacrifice, His death, and the eternal life it grants us.

We are preparing for Pascha diligently, and hopefully, this period of preparation will soon come to an end as Pascha approaches. It is a challenging time, marked by fasting and reflection. However, we must not lose sight of the true purpose of this preparation. The entire Great Lent was not merely a preparation for Pascha but a preparation for Passion Week. Passion Week itself is not just a prelude to Pascha; it *is* Pascha. Pascha is the culmination, the outcome of Passion Week, but Passion Week is not merely a preparation—it is the essence of Pascha, especially the three sacred days: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Let us reflect deeply on this.

Among these three days, Friday holds particular significance. We refer to it as Passion Friday or Great Friday, not Holy Friday or Good Friday as Catholics do. This is the day of the crucifixion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross. Brothers and sisters, let us meditate deeply on these events. Let us remain silent and focused, not allowing our attention to be diverted by secular distractions, entertainment, or idle talk. Instead, let us concentrate entirely on what our Lord has done for us and on our willingness to be crucified with Him, to follow Him no matter the cost. Let us remember His words: *"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"*—"My God, my God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matthew 27:46). In our own lives, we may often feel abandoned, even when we strive to avoid sin. During such times of spiritual warfare and affliction, we must stand firm in our faith, knowing that this is our Golgotha, our moment of suffering alongside Christ on the cross. This is the meaning, the moment of glory that the Lord has prepared for us.

Pascha is not merely about joyful celebrations, beautiful chanting, music, decorations, lights, candles, or festive meals. While these are part of the tradition, they are not the essence. This is why many people go through the entire cycle of Great Lent and Pascha without experiencing any spiritual transformation. They may appreciate the traditions and the joyful events, but inwardly, nothing changes. They remain the same sinners, untouched by the profound spiritual significance of these holy days. The true meaning often eludes them because they fail to recognize that the spiritual significance lies in the present moment, in the Passion and suffering of Christ. Instead, they think, "I hope this will be over soon so I can enjoy the celebrations and festivities of Easter." This mindset is why many attend only Sunday liturgies, neglecting the evening services. This is a secular, Protestant way of thinking—reducing the faith to mere celebration. But the evening services are crucial, for they prepare us for the coming of the Lord. They allow us to delve deeply into His suffering, into the events that made our liberation possible. The key is not the liberation itself but what made it possible—the sacrifice of Christ.

May the Lord grant us the spiritual perception to understand this deeply, to make it part of our prayers and our spiritual journey. May He teach us to take up our cross and follow Him to Golgotha. Without this understanding, the call to "take up your cross and follow Christ" becomes empty words. May He help us, guide us, and strengthen us to truly take up our cross and follow Him. Amen. May the Lord bless each and every one of you. Amen.
