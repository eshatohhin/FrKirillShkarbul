# Mission hints and ideas from Polynesia

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am still on the island of Tubuai, and I want to share with you how we practice mission work, the materials I use, and the attitude, strategy, and mindset I adopt. In the past, I approached mission work based on regular logic—what we might call carnal logic, as we are carnal beings. The apostle Paul reminds us that we need to become spiritual, for a spiritual person operates differently from a carnal one. Of course, I cannot claim to be spiritual or to be a special saint, prophet, or apostle. However, we can still strive to adopt a logic that comes from the Lord and the gospel, which can guide us in our mission.

I want to share with you some changes I’ve made to how I approach mission work. Do you recall the story of the Samaritan woman? She was near the well when the Lord came to Samaria. He spoke with her, and her life was profoundly transformed. She discovered that He was the Messiah, went to preach, and the entire town came to see Him. Notice that the Lord did not go directly to the town or try to preach to as many people as possible. He was not in a rush. He simply engaged with her, perhaps for hours—we don’t know exactly how long. It was a natural occasion—He was thirsty and came to the well—but it became a supernatural encounter.

In the past, I often relied on probability. I thought, "If I go to a big market or shopping center, there’s a high probability I’ll meet many people. I can distribute more brochures, talk to more people, and use my time efficiently. I shouldn’t waste time on slow, long conversations that might seem useless or walk on empty streets where there are few people." That was my logic. Whenever I rented a car, I drove around, trying to use my time as efficiently as possible. But this time, I’ve decided to trust the Lord completely. I believe He will arrange whatever needs to happen. My role is simply to take action in mission work—not to stay at home and do nothing, as this is not a vacation. But I’ve learned to approach things more naturally, trusting the Lord more. Sometimes, this means spending hours in conversation with someone or going to places with few people. For example, here, you might walk down the street and meet only one person in half an hour. That’s okay. I walk slowly, without rushing, and trust in the Lord’s timing.

Today, I also want to share the materials I use for mission work. I go around in priestly attire so people recognize me as a priest, or sometimes I ride a bike in regular, more formal clothing—not sportswear, but something like a shirt, preferably with long sleeves. I carry materials with me so that when I meet someone and a conversation arises, I can share something appropriate. The most basic material I use is a missionary brochure in French. This is what I bring with me to share the gospel.

Thank you for listening, and I hope this reflection on mission work and the changes I’ve made inspires you in your own journey of faith and service.

Perhaps next time, we’ll also include an introduction in the local language, as people here can read it. This brochure contains photos and provides a simple introduction to the Orthodox faith—why it is true and how it differs from other traditions. It touches on history, explaining that the Church is 2,000 years old, established by Christ Himself and existing since the time of the apostles. It also explains how the Catholic and later Protestant churches split away. Written in straightforward language, it helps readers understand the differences between Catholicism and Orthodoxy. For example, it shows how the faith in this region comes mainly from France (Catholicism) and the UK (Protestantism), while Orthodoxy remains authentic and true. The brochure includes pictures that I can use to explain concepts without requiring people to read everything immediately. For instance, I can point to the "Tree of Life" image and explain that the Church is like this tree. Simply believing in Christ is not enough; one must be connected to this tree to receive true life from the Lord. The back of the brochure includes contact information, such as my name, website, and ways to reach me via WhatsApp or Viber. This way, people can follow up if they wish.

Depending on the conversation, I can share more or even give gifts. I carry icons of the Lord and the Theotokos (Mother of God), which people can place in their homes and use for prayer. Some people may not read much, so giving them something tangible can be meaningful. For special occasions, I have larger icons, which I give as more significant gifts to those who show genuine interest or a strong connection with us. These larger icons can serve as meaningful additions to their homes and prayer spaces.

For Protestants or others who may not understand the concept of holy icons, I offer prayer ropes, which are similar to the Catholic rosary. Since I come from Russia, these prayer ropes are a tangible connection to the Orthodox tradition and can serve as tools for prayer. Over time, these items might inspire them to explore Orthodoxy further.

We’ve also printed books in French to aid people in their search for faith. Currently, we don’t distribute Gospels or the New Testament because these are readily available in stores, and we don’t have our own translation. Instead, we offer two books. The first is *300 Maxims of the Desert Fathers*, a collection of sayings from Orthodox saints that can guide spiritual life and prayer. I give this to people who believe in God but may be part of a different tradition, such as a sect or heresy. Even Mormons or Jehovah’s Witnesses might find value in these teachings. By reading these sayings, they may begin to question their current beliefs and discover the richness of Orthodox spirituality.

The second book is more specialized and intended for those already interested in understanding Orthodoxy. I have fewer copies of this book, as it’s designed for individuals who are actively seeking to learn about the faith. Both books serve as tools to plant seeds of faith and encourage deeper exploration of Orthodoxy.

Through these materials and conversations, I aim to share the truth of the Orthodox faith in a way that is accessible and meaningful to those I meet. Thank you for your prayers and support as we continue this mission work.

This book explains the differences between Orthodoxy and other traditions, such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and the ancient heresies like Monophysitism (found in Coptic and Ethiopian churches). It’s a concise and straightforward resource, not filled with high-level theology, but it covers the most essential points. It’s small and lightweight, so I can carry several copies with me, making it very convenient for distribution. This is what we currently have, but in the future, I’m considering translating additional materials or even printing a local-language Gospel to distribute here. These are some of our plans and thoughts for the future.

As always, I carry water with me for practical needs, but the most important water is the "water of life"—the true faith in the Lord that brings salvation. My hope is that more people will come to know this faith. I also encourage you to consider becoming a missionary at some point. It’s not something overly difficult, and you don’t need to wait until you become a saint, a holy father, or an apostle. Simply trust in the mission and the work of the Lord. Fight against your passions and the evil within you, and ask the Lord for the drive, motivation, and blessing to carry out this work. Seek a priest’s blessing, and then just do it. Take that step.

Please pray for the mission here in Tubuai, as well as for missions throughout Polynesia, Oceania, Taiwan, and beyond. Pray that the Lord’s work may bear fruit and multiply. Thank you all very much, and may God bless everyone. Amen.
