# Terror as a Weapon of the Devil

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about terror and terrorists.  
We recently heard about the terrorist attack in Russia, in Moscow, and of course, there have been many more attacks.  
There are significant instances of terror being used for political reasons, even by governments.  
We know about the Red Terror, the White Terror, and all kinds of terror.  
For us, it is more important to understand the spiritual meaning, not just the geopolitical or political aspects.  
We need to know how to perceive this as Christians.  
The devil is willing to harm the Church; he hates the Church and all people.  
For him, the biggest prize is to kill the soul, especially the soul of a Christian, but killing the body is also important if he can succeed in that.  
However, his greater aim is not just to harm those who are killed or injured; his greater goal is to harm everyone.  
This is why the effect of these events is much more significant, both for him and for us, because it harms society in general, Christians, and the Church.  

So, what should we be aware of? Before we delve deeper, I want to say a few words because people are wondering what is going on, who is behind it, and who benefits from it.  
I don’t want to go into politics. I know that behind this is the devil—both those who organize it and those who carry it out.  
There are two things I can say about the external events surrounding this.  
First, there is a large organization, a powerful force, standing behind this. It is not just a small group of Islamists, jihadists, or something similar; there is something very powerful behind it.  
Second, this event is part of a bigger plan. There is a narrative, a project that the prince of this world is accomplishing, and this event is a necessary part of that plan.  
We need to see what will happen next and be prepared.  
These two points are quite evident, and I don’t want to speculate further about who is behind it or why.  

Now, the more important aspect is the spiritual implications.  
First, we must recognize that those who carried out this attack are practical satanists. They are driven and inspired by the devil himself; they have become instruments of the devil.  
Second, attacks like this have several goals.  
One goal is always to spread terror and fear—to make everyone afraid of what might happen tomorrow, to change their plans, and to make them afraid of one another.  
Eventually, chaos creates a need for an earthly savior who will promise safety and demand compliance. This is a trap.  
Another goal is to sow hatred. Those who experience or witness such events may direct their hatred toward ethnic minorities, geopolitical actors, or even their own government, depending on who they believe is behind it.  
This hatred and enmity will grow, leading to despondency and a lack of trust in the Lord. People may question why the Lord allows such things to happen.  
They may stop praying or fasting, thinking, "Why bother? We fast, and yet such things happen." This is the devil’s slander, aimed at leading people away from the Lord and disrupting their spiritual lives.  
Instead of focusing on prayer and fasting, they may become consumed by the news, engaging in endless discussions, and contributing to chaos.  
This is why we pray for peace in the world and in our hearts.

So these are very evident goals. There are other goals, as I said, because there is a big plan unfolding—the plan of the prince of this world to subdue the whole world, to shackle all people and trap them. But there is also the plan of the Lord, the plan of salvation, which is also developing.  
What happened a few days ago is evidently part of the devil’s plan, and this brings me to the third spiritual point I want to make. In Revelation, we read about the beast rising from the sea, whose wound is healed, and who gains power to harm people in this world.  
This beast will eventually be accepted by everyone as a savior. He will pretend to be good, offering peace, prosperity, safety, human rights, economic benefits, and more. He will play the role of the "good guy," but now we can see his true face.  
In this terror attack, when you look at the fear it instilled in people, they encountered the devil himself. They met Satan in this experience. This is the reality—he is removing his mask. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his second letter to the Thessalonians, there is a "mystery of lawlessness" at work.  
Sometimes this mystery of lawlessness is unmasked, revealing its true nature. It must come out of hiding to accomplish its goals. This incident is an example of that lawlessness being exposed.  
We need to learn from this. It is an opportunity to see the true nature of this evil—how it operates, its intentions, and the depth of its malice. We must not cling to rosy ideas about prosperity, democracy, or other ideals. We need to recognize the enemy for what he is—this beast.  
Those who carry out such acts operate under the philosophy that evil is a means to achieve something good. This philosophy comes from the devil himself. It is rooted in dualistic thinking, where good and evil are seen as two sides of the same coin—light and shadow, hot and cold.  
This idea is present in Taoism, occultism, Kabbalah, and other schools of thought. It justifies evil actions by claiming that they are necessary to achieve a greater good. For them, human lives are expendable.  

Now, having said this, I want to reflect on the role of the Lord and His mercy. Many people are asking, "How could the Lord allow this?" Some even make outrageous claims, saying things like, "Those who attended the concert were sinners, and this is their punishment."  
Such statements are deeply wrong and, in fact, satanic. They distort the truth and misrepresent God’s nature.  
It is true that both the Bible and the Holy Fathers teach that misfortunes, such as illness or accidents, can sometimes serve as wake-up calls for repentance. However, this interpretation applies only to oneself. When something bad happens to you, it is proper to reflect on your own life and seek repentance.  
But it is forbidden to apply this reasoning to others. You cannot say, "This happened to you because you are a sinner." The Bible provides clear guidance on how we should respond when we see suffering or tragedy.  
Our reaction should be one of compassion, prayer, and support—not judgment. We must trust in the Lord’s mercy and wisdom, even when we cannot understand His ways.

What is the proper reaction? The Lord tells us to weep with those who weep, to share in their sorrow, and to feel their pain as if it were our own. We must offer compassion, help, and support to those who suffer, without judgment or condemnation. We should never say, "This happened because of your sins," for our own sins are far greater. By repenting, we acknowledge that we are the worst of sinners, placing ourselves below everyone else.  

This humility is essential. We must never think, "I am fine because I am not a sinner, but they have problems because they are sinners." Such thoughts are a grave mistake and a distortion of the truth.  

The question remains: Why does the Lord allow such things to happen? We should not assume that every event is a direct act of providence or punishment from the Lord. The Lord allows people to exercise their free will, even when it leads to great evil. For example, Hitler was responsible for the deaths of millions, yet the Lord did not intervene to stop him.  

In the process, many righteous people suffer. In Revelation, we see the souls of the martyrs crying out, asking why the Lord allows evil to persist. The Lord responds by saying, "Wait a little longer, until the full number of your fellow servants is completed." The time for retribution has not yet come.  

The Lord Himself fell victim to evil when He was crucified. Similarly, the martyrs were killed, not because the Lord abandoned them, but because He was with them, strengthening them as they bore witness to their faith. The same can be said for those who suffer in terror attacks today.  

We must never judge others. It is crucial to distinguish between people and their actions or practices.  

Now, what can be said about the event itself? The location of the attack—a large concert hall—reflects the spirit of Babylon. Such places, including shopping centers, movie theaters, casinos, and entertainment venues, are often associated with the worship of Mammon. They are designed to distract, mislead, and entrap people in materialism, drawing them away from God.  

However, this does not mean that everyone who visits such places is a worshiper of Mammon. Even Christians, including myself, may occasionally go to shopping centers or concert halls out of necessity—to buy essentials or to carry out a mission. The key is not to make these places a central part of our lives or to become attached to their atmosphere.  

Through events like this, we can draw a lesson: places of Mammon and worldly entertainment are not blessed by the Lord. They often serve as distractions from spiritual life and can lead us away from God. We must remain vigilant, ensuring that our hearts are not attached to such things and that we prioritize our relationship with the Lord above all else.

The event, and places like this—especially during Great Lent—carry a deeper meaning and lesson for us. However, this does not mean that everyone who attended such places was a sinner or that they were punished by the Lord. These are two entirely separate matters.  

What we must understand is that we should not become attached to anything that belongs to Mammon. Much of the world around us, the society and civilization we live in, is built on the worship of Mammon. These places—shopping centers, entertainment venues, and the like—are designed to distract us and draw us away from God.  

During Great Lent, we practice detachment, striving to rid ourselves of passions and sins. We recall Noah’s Ark, which was sealed from within and lifted by the floodwaters. The sealing of the Ark symbolizes the need to protect our souls from evil, keeping our inner temple holy, pure, and clean. Only then can we rise above the flood of worldly temptations and ascend to the Lord.  

Just as the Ark was lifted by the waters, so too must our souls ascend to the Lord during these 40 days. This is our task: to purify ourselves, to crucify our old selves, and to mortify our passions, desires, and wrong thoughts. We must crave spiritual food and the joy that comes from abstaining from physical pleasures.  

May the Lord grant us the eagerness, the spirit of prayer, fasting, and sacrifice, to pursue this path. May He bless and protect us from attacks like these and from the plans of Mammon that seek to ensnare us.  

We must not simply go with the flow or place too much trust in the narratives presented by the media. These narratives are designed to draw us in, but we must remain immune to them. This is why I avoid delving too deeply into the "why" or the geopolitical aspects—they are secondary to the spiritual battle we face.  

May the Lord fill your hearts with joy, blessing, and peace. God bless you all.
