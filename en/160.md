# How to avoid manipulation and have spiritual growth

Dear brothers and sisters, last time I spoke about what makes us stuck in terms of physical health and longevity, how we destroy ourselves physically.  
Today, I want to talk about what is preventing us from spiritual development and even intellectual development.  
Something that makes us foolish, unable to communicate with others, and leads us to arrogance.  
And if we find faith, it can lead us astray into heresy.  
Even if we don’t fall into heresy, we remain stuck and unable to improve. This is also very common.  
As Christians, we often struggle, lacking love for others and failing to bear the fruits of faith.  
All of this happens for a number of reasons, but one very common problem we face is our vainglory.  
This is a passion that we often fail to notice. Many passions are obvious—we act on them, and they are clear to see.  
But some passions are sneaky, like snakes hiding in the grass.  
Most people will say, "I’m not vainglorious; I don’t have that problem. I know people who are vainglorious, but it’s not me. I’m fine."  
But if we think about it, all of us are very, very self-vainglorious. Consider some examples:  
If someone speaks about your achievements or titles in front of others and you feel good, warm, or pleased—that is vainglory.  
If someone asks about your experience, education, or encounters with important people, and you eagerly share these details, glowing with pride—that is vainglory.  
Because it reflects a desire to feel important, special, or different from others. This is all vainglory.  
Even when we flatter others, saying, "Oh, you’re so smart," or "Oh, you’re so talented," it reveals that we, too, love to be flattered.  
As the Psalmist David says, whoever flatters is like a murderer.  
It all comes from Satan. You deceive others, using sweet words to blind, manipulate, or control them.  
This is akin to killing someone spiritually. It’s not much different.  
All of us struggle with vainglory. From childhood, we are taught that we must achieve, be better than others, and stand out as special.  
Our parents tell us, "You’re so special, you’re so smart." Even Freud and modern psychology emphasize the need for high self-esteem and self-confidence, warning that without it, you’ll be left behind in life.  
"You have to believe you’re the best, the smartest. Just go out and do it." But this mindset is anti-Christian, and it blinds us.  
Let’s read Revelation 3:17:  
"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."  
This is spoken about the church. God, through His angel, says, "You think you are fine, confident, and accomplished, but in reality, you are nothing. You are wretched, blind, and naked."  
This often happens in churches as well. They think, "Hallelujah, we know everything, we are great and shining," but in reality, the Spirit is absent.  
The message to each of us is this: when we reach this state, we often feel, "I want to possess knowledge, I want to be stable and secure."  
We want to be able to answer any question, to be seen as important, to have status, resources, and security for years to come.  
But this is a trap. It blinds us to our true spiritual poverty and keeps us from genuine growth in faith and love.

And then this is how I want to be. But the Lord will say, "You have reached this state, but this is nothing. In reality, you are miserable, blind, and naked."  
So, for us, there are many examples of this in daily life. This problem has two aspects. First, there is the secular aspect—where people, even without considering faith, become fixed in a particular framework or mindset.  
We often see this with older people, for example. It’s very evident that they have their worldview and cannot adjust to the reality we live in today. This kind of rigid mindset.  
Or consider narrow-minded nationalism. When someone says, "Our small nation is the most ancient; all civilization, writing systems, and everything originated from us. And that superstar, that hero, that champion? They’re from our nation."  
When we hear things like this, we laugh inwardly. We know it’s absurd because the person is blinded. It’s not funny—we laugh because we see how far removed they are from reality.  
In the same way, we are blinded in many aspects of life. This is why people struggle to understand many things. Even with health, as I’ve mentioned before, people don’t grasp it and continue to face problems.  
Or they fail to understand how the world operates. They are easily manipulated because they accept what they hear without question.  
They don’t get it because they lack humility in their hearts. But in the secular realm, we can see that Western civilization, through ancient Greek philosophy, discovered the path of humility.  
Socrates, for example, said, "I know nothing. I only seek to know. I am nothing myself, and I know nothing. I simply want to discover." This is the mindset of a child.  
The Lord also said, "Unless you become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3). Science developed from this perspective of humility and curiosity.  
Science did not develop in the same way elsewhere. Even in China, a great civilization, science as we know it did not emerge. They developed technologies, but not the scientific method.  
This is because science is rooted in the idea that we don’t know the mysteries of the world. We don’t create dogmas about how the world works; we seek to discover. If our previous theories are proven false, we abandon or adjust them.  
This is why science has advanced so much. In terms of spiritual life, returning to the secular setting, we see that when a person is given even a little power, they change.  
They feel elevated, better than others. They gain control and begin to act differently. People change when given power, and if we were given power tomorrow, we would likely change as well.  
This is because of vainglory. And this is why the Lord often withholds many things from us, even understanding. Because without humility, we would attribute everything to our own intellect or achievements.  
"What’s your IQ? What’s your education? What’s your status?" People love to write their names, to showcase their achievements on their resumes, to present themselves with big smiles. All of this is vainglory.  
All of this is vainglory. And the Lord departs from those who are consumed by it. He does not bless them.  
Instead, we are called to take up our cross and follow Him. Not to focus on who we are, what we have, what we know, or what influential people we know. All of that is garbage. It is meaningless for us.  
As Theophan the Recluse once said, "So many people are obvious garbage, yet they keep telling themselves, 'I’m different from everyone else.'"  
This is the danger of vainglory—it blinds us to our true condition and separates us from God. Let us strive for humility, recognizing our dependence on Him and seeking His will above all else.

This is indeed a profound observation. He noted that in society, so many people—despite their character, way of life, and mindset being deeply flawed—believe they are extraordinary, special, and important.  
If you criticize them, they react with outrage, claiming you’ve wounded their dignity or attacked their personality.  
This is a significant problem. Sometimes we encounter people who are excessively proud. They refuse to engage with others, have no real influence or knowledge in society, yet they carry themselves with an air of superiority.  
This pride is like a virus that infects everyone. And when we bring this virus into the Church, it becomes even more destructive.  
This is why we lack love for one another, why we fail to grow in faith, and why we keep confessing the same sins repeatedly.  
Often, we stop attending Church altogether because of this. It’s all closely tied to vainglory.  
As the Apostle Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 12:9,  
*"And He said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."*  
The key here is that the weaker we are, the more we recognize our wretchedness, our limitations, and our need for God, the more His power can work through us.  
When we stop focusing on "I am something," "I know something," or "I mean something," we begin to breathe spiritually.  
This is crucial. Let me share another example. In the Philippines, one of our missionaries declared himself a bishop.  
I spoke to him many times, explaining that his actions harmed the Church. He led many faithful astray, causing great scandal and temptation.  
I told him, "Why are you doing this? We want to work together to bring more people to faith."  
He listened, but he couldn’t truly hear me because he was consumed by his own status and glory. "I am a bishop," he thought. "I am important."  
But in reality, he was nothing—just bones and flesh. What are any of us? We are all just bones and flesh, and worse, because we misuse our bodies to commit sin.  
Objectively speaking, we are all wretched and worthless before the Lord.  
This is why it’s so important to break free from self-glorification, self-esteem, and self-confidence.  
Our confidence must come from Christ, not from our achievements, status, or anything else.  
How do we achieve this? For children, or in settings like the army or a monastery, there is often a strict supervisor who humbles us.  
They might say, "You’re foolish, you’re worthless, you forgot this, you don’t know how to do that."  
Through this, the person becomes humble and open to learning and change.  
If we don’t have someone like this to guide us, we must learn to humble ourselves.  
We need to break away from this mindset and these feelings. Sometimes we know we have this problem but struggle to fix it.  
At the very least, we must recognize that each of us struggles with vainglory and actively seek ways to overcome it.  
We should not avoid people who criticize us, even if their words are harsh, undeserved, or painful.  
When someone says something that stings, it can be a gift—a reminder that we are not as great as we think. "I am nothing. I am garbage."  
If we can place ourselves in such settings—where we are not the boss, not the best, but open to correction—we allow others to point out our blind spots and vainglory.  
They can help us see what we cannot see in ourselves. This is how we grow in humility and draw closer to God.

Indeed, society today is polluted with superficial correctness. People say, "Oh, you’re so smart," "Oh, you have such status," but it’s all fake, full of deceit.  
We must recognize the flattery of this world and avoid it—avoid it in our families, among our friends, and in all our relationships.  
This spirit of deceit, this culture of fakeness and flattery, surrounds us.  
We need to be like children, as the Lord said—not in the sense of immaturity or irresponsibility, but in having a humble heart and an open mind.  
We must be willing to listen to others, to embrace different perspectives, and to compare them with humility.  
Another important point is that the devil often mimics the Lord and His virtues.  
Many sects and false religions claim to embody humility and detachment from the world. They pretend to be pious and humble, but if you look closely, you’ll find they are riddled with problems and vainglory.  
They cannot tolerate other views and believe they alone are the saviors of the world. They see everyone else as blind and in need of rescue through them.  
They claim to be arhats, buddhas, or some other exalted beings, but it’s all a facade. There is no real humility in these religions because they rely solely on themselves.  
The devil aids them in this deception. For example, Buddha himself said, "Everything I’ve achieved is through my own efforts. I never asked for help from anyone."  
They consider it shameful to rely on God or others. This is not humility—it is immense pride disguised as virtue.  
Let us be wise. The devil tries to mimic virtue, but it is all counterfeit. True virtue comes only from the Lord and the Holy Spirit.  
May this true virtue be with us. May the Lord protect us from sin, deceit, and the flattery of this world. May His truth, goodness, and blessings be with us always. Amen.  
God bless.
