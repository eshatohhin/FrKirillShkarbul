# St. Apostles Peter & Paul the Rock vs. sand

Dear brothers and sisters, today the Holy Church is celebrating the memory of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. We remember that the Lord called Peter "the rock," saying, "Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it." Behind me lies the Pacific Ocean and a small island, which is actually a rock that will not be overthrown by these waves, perhaps for centuries. This serves as a good illustration of what the Lord is telling us. He says that a man can build a house on a rock, and neither waves, tempests, nor storms will overthrow it because it is built on a solid foundation, like the one behind me. But another man built his house on sand, on the beach also visible behind me, and that house fell down, trampled, and its destruction was great.

Our lives as Christians can indeed be set on a rock. This rock is the confession of Saint Peter: that Jesus is the Savior, the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God. This confession means not just that we recognize or acknowledge this truth, but that Jesus is at the center of our lives. We draw our hope for salvation daily from Jesus Christ and serve Him with every word, every deed, and every moment of our lives. This is where we dedicate our energy and all our time—to the ministry of Christ. This alone is the solid rock. It is not enough simply to say "yes," to wear a cross, and to declare, "I believe in Christ," while living as we please. Unfortunately, this is a return to darkness, like building a house on sand that will fall apart, be destroyed, and washed away. We do not want to be washed away; we do not want our lives to be in vain, to yield no outcome or result. This is why we need to think deeply about what it means for us: the confession of Saint Peter and the preaching of Saint Paul.

The Lord told Peter, "You will turn back and strengthen your brothers," because others had grown weak in faith. Peter had the responsibility to strengthen them, to urge them to keep going, to preach the word of Christ and His resurrection, no matter the cost. This was the function of the rock. The Lord also told Peter, "You will shepherd my flock," and indeed, Peter became the pastor who led Christ's flock. Thus, Peter's role was not to be the rock himself but to give everyone access to the rock, which is Christ. He became the bridge, the one who brought people to this rock and helped them stand firm upon it.

The Apostle Paul had a different calling. He was called to great humility, and through this humility, he gained the grace of the Lord, which gave him both the wisdom and the courage to go to the ends of the world. He was given the wisdom to teach piety and faith, applying it to every aspect of life. This is why, even in seminaries today, we study theology and learn from the epistles of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The teachings of the Church were greatly shaped by Saint Paul, who received this grace. He traveled to many countries, bringing the message of Christ and giving powerful testimony to the Word of God. Many believed and became martyrs, like Saint Thecla, who observed every word she heard from Apostle Paul and became the first woman martyr. She was also a great apostle, following in Paul's footsteps.

We can see that both Peter and Paul had special, personal callings from Christ. Each played a unique role in building the Church and spreading the Gospel, and their lives serve as powerful examples for us today. Let us strive to build our lives on the rock of Christ, following their example of faith, courage, and dedication.

And this is important for every one of us: we must not simply think, "Well, I believe in Christ because it’s good, it’s helping me, and hopefully, it will provide a good outcome for my life. In the future, I will go to heaven, I have peace of mind, and I have God’s blessing on my family, and that’s good enough." No, we each have a personal mission and task given to us by Christ, which we must understand and accomplish on a daily basis. We must establish an interpersonal relationship with Christ. That is the only way for us to be His disciples, to follow in the footsteps of the apostles. On this day, most likely in the year 67, they sacrificed their lives so that we might live. They gave us the opportunity to have a full life. They became like the rock, and the rock brings forth water. In the Old Testament, we remember how Moses struck the rock, and water flowed out. This water signifies grace, and for everyone who believes in Christ, these living waters will gush forth like a spring, creating an ocean like the one you see behind me. When we become Christians, we become like fish in this ocean, drawing life from these waters. But we must not think that we are merely here to enjoy life like fish. No, we are also called to be ministers. Each of us has the function of being a rock of faith, a preacher of the Lord’s grace, and to bring His word to others. This is our task.

Most people in this world choose darkness. They do not want to swim in this ocean; they stay on the beach. Like fish out of water, they dry out and die. They choose sin, they choose mammon, they choose fleeting pleasures that satisfy them day by day, and they do not care about Christ. For them, Christ is something distant, even if they claim to believe in Him. The devil cannot destroy the Church, but he can break off large chunks from this rock. The biggest chunk he ever managed to break away was Catholicism—a part of the holy Church that was deceived by the devil because they misunderstood Christ’s words to Peter, that he would be the rock. They thought it referred to the man, to flesh and blood. They believed that Peter and those who followed him—the bishops of Rome, their flesh and bones, and the physical building of the Vatican—were some sort of portal to heaven. They claimed that the pope was the head of the holy Church and the vicar of Christ, infallible in his teachings. This was completely off track, a great mistake and a great delusion. These people were broken off, washed away by the ocean.

Let us, therefore, remain firm so that we are not broken apart. If even such a large chunk could be struck away, any one of us can fall away. Let us stand firm, and let us ask the holy apostles to pray for us, that we may follow in their footsteps, remain steadfast on this rock, and draw from the true life that is the grace of the Lord. This grace is like the water that gives us fullness, wisdom, life, and direction in our daily lives and ministry to Christ. Please, stay strong, ask the apostles to pray for us, and strive to follow their example in your life. Amen. God bless.
