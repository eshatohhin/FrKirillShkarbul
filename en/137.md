# Is the war a trap of the devil

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a time of turmoil and political uncertainty, with this war going on and this sickness still lingering. Naturally, we ask ourselves what is happening and what is going to happen in the future. Today, I want to share with you some of my thoughts on this topic. I won't talk about politics, nationalism, who is right or wrong, or economic matters—things like that. Instead, I want to identify some of the tactics used by the Devil to create traps and lead whole nations into destruction, as he was commanded to do. This is not an answer, but rather something for you to think about and pray over.

We know there is a prince of this world, and the Lord told us that he has no hold over Him. This means that the prince of this world—the Devil, or the spirit of the Antichrist, if you will—has his own plan and his own way of controlling and leading this world toward his domination and his kingdom. Many of the things happening today are feeding into this deception. In Revelation, the Devil is called the ancient serpent who deceives nations—not just individuals, but entire nations.

So, how does he deceive nations? He does so by creating traps. These traps are designed in such a way that you are forced to make a choice. There are two options: you choose what he wants, and you live, or you choose what he doesn’t want, and you die. This was the choice presented to Christ: "Choose to be with me, and I will give you all the kingdoms and power. Choose not to, and I will kill you." And through the actions of others, the Devil attempted to carry this out. We see this pattern from the very beginning of Christ’s experience in this world.

Something similar happens very often. Even for Christ, it seemed there was no choice. But, of course, when Christ appeared to lose in this world, He ultimately triumphed over sin and death. This is the answer to what we should do in such situations. This was also the path followed by many martyrs. The term "mammon" is used here—it is the name of an ancient god, used to describe the pursuit of wealth and materialism. The prince of this world tries to create situations where there is no choice.

Let me slowly bring this to what is happening now with Russia and Ukraine, particularly the isolation of Russia. I won’t talk about politics; I will try to avoid that. In the past, what did we face? We faced choices like this: either you stay with a monarchy, within a patriarchal society, and you die because the monarch is corrupt and oppressive, or you overthrow the monarchy, establish democracy, and create a new type of society. But in this new society, instead of a monarch, you have yourself as the head—your passions, desires, egoism, and the pursuit of mammon. Those who control the money, resources, and ideology become your new rulers, representing mammon and this new lord you have chosen. In reality, you don’t gain true democracy or freedom. This is just one example from the recent history of many nations.

We have even more recent examples. For instance, during Soviet times, after the First World War, as the war raged on, Saint Nicholas, the Tsar, was pushed into a similar choice. He was told: either forfeit your power, or Russia will be destroyed. All the people will be killed in this war, and that will be the end. He was forced to abdicate, and soon after, he was killed. Under the Soviet regime, the choice was stark: you are either red or white. If you don’t side with the red, you are white, and you will either be killed or forced to fight. If you are not white, you must be red, and you will have to fight against the white. There is no other option—you are forced to kill, no matter what.

Eventually, tens of millions of people were killed in that war. Similar patterns emerge in other conflicts. During the war, if you didn’t support Stalin, Hitler would come and kill you. If you didn’t like Stalin, you still had to fight for him. You were placed in a position where there was no other choice. You were forced to make one choice or face destruction.

On an individual level, Mammon uses a similar strategy. For example, he convinces you that you must buy an expensive house because everyone else has one, and your wife might leave you if you don’t. You’re persuaded that owning a house is necessary to be a "normal" person. So, you buy the house, take on a massive mortgage, and suddenly you’re trapped. You’ll take any job, no matter how immoral or degrading, just to survive and pay off that debt. Mammon doesn’t care about your morality or well-being. If you want to spend more time with your children, you can’t. Your children grow up alienated from normal family life, brainwashed by the spirit of the Antichrist through games, TV, music, drugs, and other influences. This is Mammon’s strategy, playing out on an individual level.

Returning to the broader world, we see similar patterns. In the Soviet Union, the economy was squeezed to the point of collapse. By the 1980s, there was widespread scarcity—people had nothing to eat. The system was oppressive, and when it finally broke, people embraced the idea of a market society. But this newfound "freedom" came at the cost of moral destruction. Hedonism took over, and people were told to care only about money. Everyone else became just a source of profit. This shift from one extreme to another is a recurring theme.

With communism, the same dynamic played out. People were told that if they didn’t like the exploiters, their only choice was communism or socialism. But the system became so absurd that people stopped believing in it, and many reverted to embracing capitalist values. The Devil’s strategy is to push people from one extreme to another, leaving no middle ground. For instance, if you love your country, you’re pressured to join a movement that slowly reveals itself to be something terrifying, like Nazism. Disillusioned, you reject your love for your country altogether and become a "citizen of the world," forfeiting your cultural roots and belongingness. In this way, the Devil conquers you.

Now, coming back to what is happening today, I truly hope my predictions and concerns are wrong. But it’s important to be aware. The persecution of the Church is orchestrated by Mammon. Who else? He hates Christ and sees anything related to Christ as an obstacle. In our times, he can’t act as directly as he did in ancient times—he can’t simply kill Christians outright, at least not in most parts of the world. So, on a global scale, what can he do?

We saw this in Soviet times. The Bolsheviks used political and economic theories to justify their actions. If you didn’t support the proletariat, you were labeled an aristocrat, landowner, or capitalist—an enemy to be destroyed. The Church, if it didn’t align with the government’s atheist policies, was branded as counter-revolutionary. They didn’t kill Christians because they believed in Christ; they killed them because they were seen as political enemies. This is how the Devil operates—through deception, manipulation, and the illusion of choice.

Only because of your political role. You have to be destroyed. That is the only choice—either you are with us, or you are against us. The persecutions that are coming will follow a similar pattern. We already see this in Ukraine, where if you are a canonical priest whose patriarch is in Moscow, you are accused of being "with the aggressor." They say, "You cannot betray your country." It’s not because you are Orthodox—no, no, no. It’s because of your perceived political alignment. This gives them carte blanche, a ready-made excuse to persecute you.

The same thing could happen in Russia. If war comes to Russia, the same logic will be applied. They will come to you and say, "You don’t support what we are doing now—our fight, our official opposition. You are betraying your country. You want others to conquer us. Therefore, you must go to prison or face other consequences." This is how persecution can be justified. It’s not just individuals creating these schemes; behind it all is the spirit of the Antichrist, using every possible means to destroy the Church of Christ.

This pattern can also manifest on a global scale. For example, if a measure is introduced that restricts buying and selling, they might say, "You are against this system. You are against life. You are against humanity. You want disease to spread and kill everyone." It’s not because you are Christian—no, no, no. It’s because you oppose a system that requires a code to buy or sell anything. This is something we can already anticipate. We hope it won’t happen soon, but we must be prepared for it.

We must not allow ourselves to be squeezed into these false choices. Even Christ was forced into such a choice. He chose not to align with the powers of this world, and He was killed. If we are called to sacrifice our lives, our property, our children’s education, or even access to basic goods for the sake of Christ, we must be ready to do so. Let us be watchful and not be dragged into propaganda, no matter which side it comes from. We must not be driven by emotions, swayed by pictures or narratives designed to manipulate us. We need to stay out of politics, nationalism, and all forms of propaganda.

May the Lord be with us, giving us strength and helping us to remain spiritually vigilant. Only by staying close to Christ can we remain on the right side. May the Lord bless you with a right heart, humility, and wisdom to judge the events of our time correctly. May the Lord bless you.
