# New Year Renewal in Christ or Death in Sodom

Dear brothers and sisters, I would like to wish you all a happy and blessed new year. Today, I want to share with you some wishes for the new year and some thoughts that I have at this time.

As we enter into this new year, we have certain expectations. There is something positive in a new beginning. Now, every time we write a date, we will write 2023, which brings something new to our lives. However, for us, the important thing is not the day or the year. What matters is that everything is dedicated to the Lord. So, I truly wish that this time we can open a new page in our lives, a page that will record new fruits that we bring to the Lord—new fruits of faith.

Let us look back to the Old Testament, when the people of Israel made a covenant with the Lord, and new people were invited to join this covenant. The way they did it was by gathering those people, and someone would proclaim a commandment aloud, such as "Do not kill; anyone who kills is cursed." The people would respond with "Amen," confirming their commitment to entering into this covenant. Whoever kept this commandment would receive the Lord's blessing. Everything revolved around the Lord's blessing and the Lord's curse.

So, this new year, will we have the Lord's blessing with us, or will we face His curse? Whenever people commit sin, they disobey His commands—whether they are Old Testament commands or New Testament commands, where we are called to sacrifice our whole soul for Christ and follow Him. When we disobey, we are cursed. We lose the Lord's blessing and fall out of the covenant. In such a miserable state, we exist, we die, and we perish. All the tribulations falling upon this world are a result of people breaking the commandments. If they live according to Old Testament morality and break it, this brings God's curse. If they proclaim that they have entered into the Christian covenant, the new covenant, and then break it, that brings another curse from the Lord—not because He hates us, but because He is faithful to His covenant. This is what is stipulated in the covenant.

We know that the Lord's love encompasses both mercy and righteousness, as well as judgment. It is just, and this is something we are meant to receive. Along with God's mercy comes love. Love can also be expressed through punishment. These are some basic thoughts I have.

I truly hope that each of us can recognize that we are in a state of brokenness, that we are shackled—both mentally and in our old lives. Our hearts are full of passions, desires, and addictions. We are not free; we remain in that old state, the old self. We need to break away from this. May this new year bring us liberation from all these things—both mentally and in our motivations, in what we love and desire. May we discover that righteousness and life in Christ are higher and more precious than anything else on earth. May this be our guiding principle and vision for the coming year.

This is so important because what is happening in the world today clearly reveals the two actors behind all the complex political, economic, and social issues. There are two real actors standing behind these events. One is our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior, the Son of God, who came into this world to bring salvation and expects people to enter into union with Him, to partake in His eschatological supper, receiving His body and blood, and to live according to His commandments. At the same time, there is another actor, whom Jesus called the "prince of this world," and whom the Holy Fathers refer to as the antichrist, whose spirit is always present. Behind him stands Satan himself.

And what we see now is that almost all nations, all people in every nation, serve mammon—including ourselves. If we are honest, we can see that by sitting idle, by living without strong faith, by not following Christ every day and every moment of our lives, we choose mammon. We need to recognize this in ourselves first. Then we can see it clearly in the world at large. These two actors—Christ and the antichrist—are becoming more and more evident.

Just today, the great monastery of the Kiev Lavra—you may have heard of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, a monastery established over 1,000 years ago, from which thousands of holy people have emerged—has been forbidden to hold divine services in its main part, the so-called Upper Lavra. This monastery has been open since Soviet times for more than 30 years. When I was a child, perhaps 10 years old, I went there to pray. For all these years, every day, the church has prayed there. But beginning today, it has been ordered to stop. No services, no liturgy, nothing. Why? They cite many political reasons, but the real reason is that the antichrist is chasing the church. He is trying to rid the world of the church so that it cannot fulfill its ministry openly. These evil forces are now emerging. The antichrist is unmasking himself, removing his disguise, and revealing his true nature. These are troubling times as we enter this new year.

We should not have a rosy picture that everything is getting better. Many punishments are still to come—economic, political, and global. Orthodox and non-Orthodox countries alike will face severe consequences because, as I mentioned, people are falling away en masse, choosing mammon over Christ. Yet, we should not despair. Consider Sodom and Gomorrah, where everyone lived in sin. Only one righteous man, Lot, and his family were worthy of being saved from the city’s destruction. We must strive to be like Lot. We should not say, "Everyone is like this, so I am too." We must not be polluted by the world we live in. We must understand that much of what we believe and feel is a product of our old selves, shaped by this society and this world. We need to shed these things and let them go.

Even Lot’s wife, though she was saved, looked back at the city she loved because of her attachment to it, despite the Lord’s command not to look back. We, too, must not look back at anything unworthy or unrelated to Christ in any way from our past lives. This is something to reflect on as we enter the new year. Like the Holy Apostles, who, when they began preaching the Gospel, wrote only about what happened after they met Christ. The Gospels are their memoirs, their recollections, but they did not write about their childhoods or their lives before Christ. Even Peter, who was quite old at the time, understood that his entire life before meeting Christ was irrelevant, unimportant, and without value. Similarly, we should have no attachment to our past ways of life. We now live for Christ, with Christ, seeking Him and striving to please Him in all that we do.

Let this be our goal and aim in the coming year: even if everything around us is falling apart, we will remain with the Lord, like the righteous Lot, and His blessing will abide upon us. May it be so. May He strengthen our faith, keep us in His covenant, renew our hearts and souls, and perform the miracle of restoring, reviving, and liberating our souls from all the evil within them. For He is the sole Savior, and only with Him can we preserve ourselves in truth and in His blessing.

May the Lord be with us, granting us wisdom, guidance, and protection. May He help us on this path, enabling us to find it and to love it with all our hearts. Amen. May the Lord's blessing be with you, your family, and your friends in this new and upcoming year.
