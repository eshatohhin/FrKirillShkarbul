# We need a Family in Christ

Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm in Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan. We just had a divine service here with a small but faithful group. Even though there is no priest here most of the time, the group still exists, and it is very impressive how this group formed from nothing. It started with just a few scattered individuals, but slowly, step by step, it became such a group, such a family of faithful. Now we gather—we don't have a church—we gather in a restaurant run by one of the faithful. This is really very similar to the early church experience when people gathered in dining halls, but they had very strong love for each other. We can read in Acts 4:32 that many of the faithful, those who believed, had one heart and one soul, and no one claimed anything as their own, but rather everything they had was common. This is like one family. In a family, we usually don't say, "This is mine, this is yours." In a Christian family that is very faithful, we don't really distinguish between mine and yours. 

Do we have such families now on the parish level, on a level that is above just our own little family of relatives? That really depends on each other. We cannot do otherwise. Even within our families, we don't have very good relationships now—there's a lack of trust, mutual understanding, and love. But it's even less so on the parish level. People come, they consider it their thing: "I talk to God, and it's finished. I go, and that's it. I don't want to stay for a common meal; it's not my thing. I just think to God, and now I go back." This is really very strange because we need to have this family. The Lord tells us that we are saved in this family, within this family. Without this family, you will be lost. You cannot really have this growth in Christ. So we need to strive for this. Maybe if we don't have such parish life, we should not just blame the priest or other people for being selfish or egoistic. We need to begin with ourselves. What can we do? Maybe we can contribute somehow, take some initiative. Let's get together, let's care for someone, do something, some common project. Talk to the priest, offer some help, some contribution for what is perfect. That is very important. We should kill this egoistic thinking and this thinking that "I'm the smartest, and everybody else is just a problem. They will ask me something; it's just a hassle. That's why I keep alone, I keep social distance." This stupid phrase, "social distance"—we don't need social distance in the church.

In ancient times, we see that the whole society had such groups, such families that united people, not just on the family level but on a higher level. In very ancient times in Greece, there was this polis culture. They had Athens and other big cities, and the whole city gathered together—the noblemen, the citizens (not the slaves)—and they discussed things together: what they needed to do, what was happening. That was their social life. Later, this culture diminished, but in Greek or Roman culture, those small congregations, brotherhoods, or different corporations got together. They were called Collegia, Hateria, fraternitas—those groups got together. It was usually not more than 50 people, and they also discussed things. They had social life, they allowed for recognition of their members by this group, and they helped the poor members. They provided a lot of growth and self-expression opportunities for them, so people could really grow. They had this support. They always provided for burial expenses if somebody died. So, in many ways, this was their family above family. And later, the early Christians...

They joined such communities, and for Christians, this replaced those pagan communities and brotherhoods. It served a very similar social role, but in the church, they also felt this mystical union with God when they gathered together in such communities. This is what we are lacking right now—this sense of family. Each one of us needs to strive to be willing to have such a family, beginning with ourselves, and contribute to such a purpose. It's not like Facebook; that's all fake. It's replacing, not some other groups. Again, our main family, beyond our relatives, should be related to Christ somehow. Otherwise, it's just some club. We can participate in all kinds of associations and things like that, but this should not become our family. Our true family, on this social level, has to be related to Christ somehow. 

St. Nicholas of Serbia tells us this. He calls the audience, the reader, "Brethren, brethren, let us do this. Brethren, do you see this?" And we feel that from him, it's not just some protocol thing or rhetoric, like calling "Ladies and Gentlemen." It has this feeling that he is an elder member of the family, caring for us as our elder brother, someone in a very close spiritual relationship with us, even though he passed away about 70 years ago. This tells us that the family is bigger than only the people in my city or the Orthodox people I know. The family I have includes saints, includes the faithful who have already passed on. In Ephesians, we read that the Apostle Paul says, "You became co-citizens with the saints." Well, we are the same family with the saints through rejecting this world, through being born again. We need to feel that affiliation, that relationship with our saints as well. It should make us find friends there, not only among the leading members of the parish community. 

So, we should not always say, "Oh, there are no people like that in my town," or "Forget about it." No, there are always people because it's the sum of many members—it's more than just a sum; it's a synthesis. So, 1 plus 1 equals more. It gives us much more. And we know that this works even in the secular world because all those brotherhoods and clubs have such power. Now we have Lions Clubs, the Masons, and Catholics with their orders. They go to different countries and do many projects. It's really a big power, much bigger than just one person. The same works with people in Christ. When we are together, we can be a really strong force against evil, against the devil in this world. It will help both us and the whole world. This is very, very important. 

Now we are scattered. Everyone thinks that they are maybe the smartest or that everybody else will betray them, so they are suspicious. This really makes us so weak because one person, at any time something happens, is off, out of the game. But with the family, we can keep going. We can do many things, like an army of Christ, a battalion, and form like a battalion. So, I really advise that the Orthodox can form more associations, not only on a parish level—these families. We can also have an association of Orthodox entrepreneurs, or writers, or editors, publishers, people for publishing Orthodox books. Brotherhoods like that played a big role in Ukraine when it was part of Poland, and the Catholic pressure was very great. It was these brotherhoods who published books. They were able, even though small, to keep the faith and fight against the cultural and political power that was trying to invade them.

We can also have brotherhoods for pilgrimage, for trips, for volunteers who do some volunteer work, or for missionaries. This also requires that union. Maybe researchers who study the Divine Liturgy, architects—it can be anything, as long as it is done in the spirit of love, not as a bureaucratic thing or to show off. It’s not about getting together for photos, Facebook, and things like that. No, it’s about creating a family union of Christians in Christ, united by Christ, for some specific purposes. 

This was almost destroyed in Orthodox countries under the Soviet system, under communism. In many places, it was completely destroyed—any kind of gathering. Even the kitchen was made very small, so you couldn’t fit more than two or three people in it. This is a big problem we have now: everyone is scattered. All the brotherhoods were destroyed. The Kazakh groups were destroyed, those fundraising clubs for sponsoring activities were destroyed, and other unions for pilgrimage to the Holy Land were almost entirely wiped out. The noble people were destroyed. So, it is really important that we are not just a mass culture, or a mass of atomized individuals who think in the same way because they watch the same things and have very similar experiences. 

Let us unite, and not just on Facebook or through other superficial means. That’s really fake; it’s not real love or real union. We should not be afraid of people who might betray us. Even Christ was not afraid of Judas. He took him everywhere, taught him everything, and knew everything. If Judas betrayed Him, we should not be afraid of that. We should not think, "Oh, now we trust each other, and something will happen." We just do things. We ourselves have to be loyal, not betrayers, and leave everything else in the Lord’s hands. 

So, let us have such a wide-open heart, embracing and being open to other people, especially to the Orthodox who are also called by Christ for salvation. We will form such groups, and we will reach great results, bringing much bigger fruits of faith that the Lord is expecting from us. May the Lord help us, give us such blessings, and such a heart for ministry, serving, and sacrificing ourselves. Amen. God bless.
