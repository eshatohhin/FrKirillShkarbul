# Our materialistic logic is our blindness. Why disasters come

Dear brothers and sisters, today we have become similar to the rest of society. We have grown very materialistic, believing that material things—our income, our education, our country, our government—determine what will happen, what our lives will be like, whether we will have a strong country and economy or a weak one. These things seem to decide everything. If we have financing, we can invest and then pursue other goals. This logic comes from below. We remember Christ’s words to the people: "You are talking about things from below, and I am talking about things from above." Christians are called to be idealists, and in this context, being an idealist means believing that the spiritual determines everything. Spiritual reality shapes material outcomes. The spirit seeks forms for itself.

When we face crises, such as the one the world is experiencing now, we must first recognize that the root of this crisis is spiritual, and the cure must also be spiritual. Wearing masks and taking other precautions are important and should be done, but they are secondary. As Christians, we know that all the problems, tribulations, and challenges faced by the world and the church have spiritual roots and reasons. We must change our mindset completely. This truth is an ironclad rule—absolute and firm—that the spiritual brings about material results and outcomes. We see this principle throughout the Bible, beginning in the Old Testament. It was God’s promise and the people’s trust in that promise that led them to the Promised Land. Even with Abraham, when he trusted God, he received what was promised. In all the wars, when the Israelites remained faithful to the Lord, they were victorious. But as soon as they turned to false gods or neglected their faith, they were conquered and enslaved. This pattern was inevitable unless they repented.

We see a similar pattern in the history of the church. The great spiritual efforts and testimonies of the early martyrs led to the spread of Christianity across the known world during the time of Saint Constantine, whose icon we see behind me. This brought the victory of Christianity, but it did not last long—only about two centuries. Soon, people became complacent, and Christians of that time became consumed with daily affairs, focusing only on their own well-being. As a result, they faced numerous problems: the Justinian Plague, devastating earthquakes that destroyed entire cities, the Persian invasion, the Arab invasion, and internal strife, including the assassination of the emperor and his family, which brought great sorrow and turmoil to the Byzantine Empire, the Christian Roman Empire of that time. The saints tell us that these events occurred because the Lord allowed them to happen as a consequence of people drifting away from God.

Similar patterns emerged later in history. For example, when the Mongols invaded Russia, it was due to spiritual decline. People claimed to be Christians but did not live as Christians. However, through the spiritual efforts of saints like those of the Kyiv Caves and Saint Sergius of Radonezh, there was a revival of faith, leading to the expulsion of the Mongols and the strengthening of Russia. Yet, by the 18th and 19th centuries, significant spiritual problems arose again, leading to the collapse of the Russian Empire, the persecution of the church, the killing of many Christians, and the near-destruction of the church at that time.

This pattern reminds us that spiritual health is the foundation of all material outcomes. As Christians, we must prioritize our spiritual lives, trusting that the spiritual shapes the material. Let us not forget this truth as we navigate the challenges of our time.

So we see that the Lord works in such a way that He blesses Christians when they remain faithful to their faith and loyal to God. This relationship with God is spiritual—is it healthy, strong, and firm? If not, if we abandon the Lord, all kinds of troubles will follow. Of course, this is not a one-to-one relationship, and what we are discussing applies not only on a national or church level but also on an individual level. It is not a direct correlation because being loyal to God and strong in faith does not guarantee wealth, prosperity, or a life free of challenges. A faithful person may still face sorrows and hardships, which can serve to strengthen their faith and purify their soul through suffering. These trials are ultimately for their good. Therefore, we must approach these matters with wisdom, understanding that the troubles we face stem from spiritual causes. Consequently, the cure and solution must also come from spirituality—not merely from seeking more financing or material resources. Instead, we need more prayer, more repentance, and a deeper commitment to our spiritual lives, especially during Lent.

We must also recognize the presence of evil. Today, there is a great temptation for Christians to believe that everything is fine, that no one is evil, and that nothing bad is happening. This mindset lulls people into a spiritual slumber, a kind of hypnosis, where they think, "Everything is fine; we go to church, we pray." But we must remember that we are soldiers in a spiritual war, and a soldier must always be aware that the battle is ongoing. If we do not feel or see the war, it means we are not on the front lines; we are resting. This leaves fewer people to fight, and we risk losing the battle.

Another critical point is that everyone can make a difference. A common mistake is to think, "What can I do? I am just one person; I cannot influence anything." This leads us to focus only on our own lives and well-being, including our spiritual well-being, while believing that nothing depends on us. This is a grave error that renders us incapable of fighting evil, both within ourselves and in the world. We must remember that we are soldiers, and each of us, no matter how isolated or distant, can contribute to the victory we must achieve in this battle against evil.

May the Lord grant us understanding and strength during this Lenten season, helping us to be strong, united, and victorious over evil. This victory will, in turn, resolve many of the physical and more visible problems we face, starting from the Spirit. May the Lord help us and bless us. Amen.
