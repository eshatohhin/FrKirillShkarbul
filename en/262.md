# The Task of an Apostle is to Destroy Babylon

Dear brothers and sisters, this coming Friday we will celebrate the feast of the great apostles Peter and Paul.  
We are at the end of the apostolic season, and during these holy days, we reflect deeply on the ministry of the apostles.  
How can we also become participants in this great mission?  
The Lord sent everyone to bear witness to what? To His love, to His self-sacrifice,  
to the resurrection that transforms lives, that enlightens people, and brings them into the realm of the kingdom of heaven,  
freeing them from every evil darkness and from the slavery to their own passions, wrong ideas, and philosophies.  
This testimony began with the apostles, this testimony of the Church as it was established on Pentecost.  
This is why the apostolic season is connected to Pentecost. It begins on the second Monday after Pentecost.  
This year, it is very short. We had a late Pentecost, so the season runs from July 7th to July 11th—only five days.  

It may seem to us that the apostles were a very special type of saint.  
In reality, our ministry today is the same in nature as the ministry of the apostles.  
However, there are some differences. In those days, the whole world was in darkness, and no one knew about Christ, the resurrection, or the Gospel.  
Today, after 20 centuries of preaching, almost everyone on this planet has heard something about the Gospel.  
At the very least, they have heard something about Jesus Christ.  
Some people argue that there is no longer a need for apostolic or even missionary work,  
since nearly everyone has access to the internet and can research these things themselves.  
Even if you go to a new place, you would need to offer them something more.  
You cannot simply present them with the Gospel.  

Today, I want to dedicate this video to a very important aspect of modern testimony for which every Christian is responsible.  
We could talk about many things—spiritual life, ways of doing mission—but today I want to focus on one point.  
This point is related to breaking the "Babylon."  

In ancient times, the world was enslaved by sin.  
It was as though it was covered by a dome, a metal jar, so to speak, and people were living within this jar—  
or, to use Plato's parable, like prisoners in a cave.  
This was not just in their minds; it was a spiritual reality.  
They were enslaved and blinded by sin and passions, unable to find their way out.  
No philosophy, no religion, nothing could liberate them from this state.  
But the holy apostles, armed with the message given to them by the Lord and Savior,  
were given a great vision of what they had to do.  
The Holy Spirit, which they received on Pentecost, gave them the boldness and wisdom to carry out this mission.  
They broke through all kinds of errors, all forms of enslavement, and crushed the idols of their time.  
Great monarchies and empires were subdued by the salvific message of Christ.  

Today, the task is the same.  
Essentially, we live in a world of Babylon.  
Despite the transmission of the Gospel message, many have turned away.  
They have fallen into apostasy. I often speak about apostasy.  
Many call themselves Christians, but they are not.  
Others reject Christianity entirely, choosing other "messiahs" like Lenin or Stalin,  
or following other religions, false religions, and fake prophets, even being willing to die for them.  
The world today is enslaved once again.  
The world today is blinded.  
Even Christianity has become so corrupted that many do not realize they serve mammon while pretending to serve Christ.  
I have dedicated many videos to this topic, but today I want to speak about this "Babylon" that covers everyone, including most Orthodox Christians.  
Spiritually, this happens because of alienation from Christ.

People recite prayers into emptiness.  
They go to church merely to perform rituals.  
They open the Bible only to interpret its words according to their own desires.  
They are stubborn in this direction, much like the Babylonians who built the Tower of Babel, fixated and obstinate in their idea.  
They were possessed by the notion of replacing God with themselves.  
The Tower of Babel, or Babylon, was meant to bring the heavens down to earth, to replace the true heavens with an earthly kingdom of pleasure, satisfaction, and glory that they sought to claim for themselves.  
"Let us make a name for ourselves," they said in their folly.  
This was an act of defiance in the eyes of the Lord.  
When He came down, He saw how far people had strayed from Him.  
They no longer wanted Him; they wanted something else.  
They desired the earth to be their kingdom, their heavens, their paradise.  
Yet, the Lord extended His mercy.  
He did not destroy them but instead confused their languages.  
He sent His angels to bring about this change.  

This image of ancient Babylon in the Old Testament helps us understand the symbolism of the "harlot of Babylon" in the Apocalypse.  
We are living in the end times, and indeed, we have been living in the apocalypse since the time of the apostles, but especially today.  
Everything written in the Apocalypse is unfolding in one way or another.  
A key message is that the harlot of Babylon is blocking the heavens.  
She presents herself as the new heavens, a false image.  
What does this mean?  
What do I mean by blindness today?  

There are two states in which almost everyone exists today, and people often switch between them.  
The first state is one of active passion, driving a person toward some goal—buying a car, saving money, securing a good job, traveling, pursuing hobbies, or even wasting time on sports, movies, soap operas, or video games.  
People are driven by these passions, willing to lose hours, days, and years of their lives.  
They are consumed by activities that offer no real fulfillment.  
Some are even drawn to destructive behaviors like drugs or excessive partying.  
Others are driven by pursuits in science, research, or other endeavors, completely consumed by a force that distracts them from God.  

This passion is the passion of Babylon.  
It is the desire to create something apart from God, to seek glory and a false paradise for oneself.  
The fire of this passion is the fire of Gehenna, the eternal fire of condemnation that draws near when we give in to such desires.  
Most of us have experienced this.  
At least Christians, or those who still have a conscience not entirely burned away, recognize this.  
We must understand that whenever this passion arises—perhaps accompanied by a cold sweat or unease—it is the fire of Gehenna approaching.  
If we do not turn away, if we do not repent with tears and turn to Christ, we risk being consumed by it.  

The false light that attracts us to these pursuits—whether it be material success, entertainment, or worldly achievements—is not the light of the Kingdom of Heaven.  
It is the light of Lucifer, the one who masquerades as an angel of light.  
This false light leads us away from God and into the bondage of Babylon.  
We must be vigilant, recognizing these temptations for what they are and turning our hearts back to Christ, the true light and salvation.

Another state that many people find themselves in—another face of the same coin—is pessimism and a complete rejection of reality.  
This is when everything feels gloomy, when life loses its meaning, and what we do seems pointless.  
The future holds no hope, people are liars, the government is corrupt, the weather is bad, the country I live in is terrible—everything feels so bleak.  
This is called despondency or sorrow for earthly things, a sense of loss over dreams that never came to fruition, disappointment about life, career, or family.  
We don’t want to face this reality, so we retreat into despair.  

This mindset is also deeply materialistic, as it reduces existence to just this world—cars, noise, clouds, and nothing more.  
It’s the gloomy face in the mirror that stares back every morning, devoid of hope or purpose.  
This despondency is another slander from the devil, designed to block the heavens.  
It whispers, "There is no heaven. The Lord will not help you. I am your lord. Don’t hope for God; it’s all nonsense. You cannot be a saint. There is no divine help, no providence. Salvation is closed to you. God is dead," as Nietzsche said—dead for most people living in apostasy.  
This is another way Babylon blocks the heavens.  

Of course, there is also fake spirituality—occultism, New Age practices, pagan religions like yoga, Hinduism, Zen Buddhism, and other such nonsense.  
This includes the mysticism in Catholicism and the madness of Charismatic movements that are now everywhere.  
These are all surrogates for salvation, but they fall into the first category—obsession with something, even if it’s a fake spirituality.  
It may call itself Christian ten times over, but it has nothing to do with Christ. In fact, it is anti-Christian, working against Him.  

In this world, the task of a disciple of Christ is to overthrow Babylon—first within themselves.  
This "pharaoh" that controls us through our passions, wrong ideas, selfishness, obsession with material things, fears, cowardice, and attachment to comfort and possessions must be defeated daily.  
Only then can we gain the Lord’s Spirit and the boldness to bear witness to the joy of salvation, the spiritual pleasure of self-sacrifice, ministry, and unconditional love for others.  
This is something foreign to the world and almost absent today, even among Christians—even among Orthodox Christians, not to mention heretics.  

So let us set this goal, brothers and sisters. It is very much possible.  
The Lord’s grace is as powerful as ever; it has not diminished.  
It is we who are weighed down by worldliness, by the "old man" still living within us.  
Let us put effort into prayer and spiritual life. The Lord will show us how to do this if we are ready to sacrifice everything—our time, energy, and resources—for Christ and the Gospel, for the person next to us, for our neighbor, for strangers we meet on the street.  
There is no one who is foreign to us, no one alien. We bless even our enemies and those who do wrong—killers, murderers—because they, too, are victims of Satan.  
We pray for them, we love them, we offer total forgiveness, and we fight against evil, against demons, against all forms of passion.  
This is how we break Babylon.

Indeed, it is not us, but the Spirit of the Lord who will break all this—as long as we are willing to surrender ourselves to Him.  
This surrender comes through humility, through obedience to the holy tradition of the Church, which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and through a full focus on the spiritual life.  
May the Lord grant us such eagerness and such a heart.  
May He bless the fruits of our efforts, giving us a profound sense of meaning that overcomes all despondency.  
We will see light—light in the things we do every day, light in the future, and light in the people around us.  

May this be so. May we abide in Christ every day of our lives.  
God bless you, brothers and sisters.
