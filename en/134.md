# Is Antichrist behind this war

Dear friends, today I want to share with you some new thoughts about what's happening in Ukraine. I don't want to talk about politics; instead, I want to discuss some spiritual risks and what this could mean in terms of the apocalypse, the battle between the Devil and Christ, and His Church in this world. I don't want to delve too deeply into this matter, especially when the Great Land begins. But for now, we're still approaching the Great Land, and we need to approach it with peace in our hearts.

The greatest risk is that we lack peace between Russia, Ukraine, and so many others, with families now divided. Without peace, we cannot pray. This is another topic I want to address next time. Before we enter the Great Land, I want to share some thoughts about what might be happening, and I want to move away from a political perspective. If you strongly support one side, whether Ukraine or Russia, if you believe Putin is the worst person in the world or a great and powerful leader with hope in him, what I say may not be useful to you.

We need to distance ourselves from these emotions and the performances we see in the media. While some of it may be real, it is also a game, a kind of arrangement. We must look beyond these things to the spiritual power of the Antichrist, who is trying to invade this world and bring it under his total control and deception. The Church of Christ stands in the way, bringing the testimony of Christ and serving as an obstacle to the Antichrist. At the end of this world, the Antichrist's plan will succeed, but it will ultimately be overthrown by Christ. In this, the greatest good will be accomplished, and the triumph of the Lord's righteousness, mercy, and truth will prevail.

This is the big picture. Now, let us consider what the Antichrist's agenda might be in this ongoing world war. The methods being used are audacious, and not many would think such things could happen. Events like 9/11, for example, may also have the Antichrist behind them. Other actions might be carried out by brave individuals, but I am not saying Putin is the Antichrist. Today, I simply want to hypothesize that what is happening now is the success of the Antichrist. I hope I am wrong, and I hope what I say today is false. We will see in about a month how this war develops and whether my words hold any truth.

I am hopeful that I am incorrect. My intention is simply to attempt to think like the Antichrist. The Apostle Paul said we know the plans of Satan. I am not as spiritual as Paul, but I also want to try to think like the Antichrist. In each of us, there is an old self, and this old self is Antichristian. We can look within ourselves to understand the Antichrist. Of course, we must kill our old self, but we can still use it to better understand the Devil's intentions and how he deceives.

Today, this is just a guess, and I am not claiming this is how things are. It is simply something for everyone to consider and reflect on, observing what is happening to see if it holds any truth.

First, the Antichrist and the Devil have extensive experience in pitting nations against each other, fostering hatred. We see this in conflicts like India and Pakistan and in Europe, where wars and hatred persisted for centuries.

In recent history, we have seen conflicts between the Serbs and Croats, in East Timor, and countless others across Africa, where war seems perpetual. Small nations with border disputes or ethnic tensions are constantly at odds. We see this in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and in so many other places. These divisions are fueled by the spirit of the Antichrist, who thirsts for blood, suffering, and chaos. The Antichrist thrives on hatred and division because peace is the prerequisite for prayer. Without peace, there is no prayer, and without prayer, God does not intervene directly in our lives, and His mercy remains distant.

The Devil seeks to incite war. When you see people quarreling, you can sense the spirit of the Antichrist—anger, violence, and destruction. This spirit is evident in the ongoing war in Ukraine, where the Antichrist seeks to deepen the divide between Ukrainians and Russians. Ukrainians are being driven to hate Russians, and Russians are being led to view Ukrainians as enemies or as a people who must be assimilated into Russia. This hatred is being actively fostered, and it is strong.

As Christians, we must detach ourselves from these emotions. If you have ties to Russia or Ukraine, try to see beyond national identities. Remember, we are all children of God, and the Church transcends all nations. Wars will begin and end, but the Church will endure, regardless of who wins—whether it is Russia, Ukraine, the United States, or even if the Antichrist rises to power. Our focus must remain on Christ, our testimony, and our mission, no matter the circumstances. We must face whatever comes with faith and unity in Christ.

To think clearly about what is happening, let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that behind all these events lies the influence of the Antichrist. This is not to say that specific leaders or nations are inherently evil, but rather that the Antichrist's agenda may be at work through these conflicts. If this is the case, the Antichrist likely has three primary goals in this war.

First, to create an irreparable divide between Ukrainians and Russians, solidifying hatred and enmity. This division has been cultivated through decades of propaganda, but the war has intensified it, with lives lost and communities destroyed. Whether this is the final break remains to be seen, but it is a possibility.

Second, the Antichrist may aim to destabilize the region further, clearing the land and society of its current inhabitants to establish a new order. This is a grim scenario, but one we must consider as we prepare for the worst.

Third, the Antichrist seeks to undermine faith and hope, replacing them with despair and division. As Christians, we must resist this by holding fast to our faith, praying for peace, and standing united in Christ, no matter the challenges we face.

Let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that some individuals—children of the Antichrist, so to speak—desire to establish a new form of life, a new society, and new relationships in this region. To achieve this, they must first clear away what currently exists. This is not about Russians or any specific group taking over, but about creating space for their own vision of society, their way of thinking, and their way of life. Over the past 30 years, Ukraine's population has already halved for various reasons, and now this war may serve as the final act to displace the remaining population, allowing them to build anew from scratch. Is this the case? I hope not, but it is a possibility we must consider.

The third potential objective behind this war is to completely isolate Russia from the rest of the world, ensuring that it is hated for decades to come. Why? Because Russia represents the last major pillar of Orthodox Christian testimony in the world. While the Church may be a minority in Russia, and not all Russians are Orthodox Christians, the country remains a significant stronghold of traditional faith and values, standing against the moral decay and ideologies that oppose Christian teachings. Many missions, including those I have participated in—such as in Sri Lanka and Dominica—rely on support from Russia. Missionaries, funding, literature, and resources often come from Russia. Without this support, carrying out such missions would become far more difficult. Flights are restricted, the ruble has fallen, and some countries may bar Russians from entering. If this situation worsens, Russia's ability to support global Christian missions could be completely blocked, halting the Church's witness. This is precisely what the Antichrist desires—a repeat of the isolation and suppression seen during Soviet times.

Is this another goal of the Antichrist? Are the sanctions and restrictions part of a larger plan to achieve this? If so, the Antichrist may be closer to succeeding than we realize. I am not saying there cannot be positive outcomes from this conflict—there may well be. We will see as the war unfolds, and I sincerely hope that these worst-case scenarios do not come to pass. Today, however, I am focusing on the potential dangers, not because I am pessimistic, but because we must be prepared. We must hope for the best but be ready for the worst.

Please pray for all those suffering in Ukraine—for the lives lost, for those being killed every day, and for the countless families torn apart. Pray for peace and wisdom. Let us strive to preserve peace in our hearts and within our families, resisting the temptation to harbor hatred, no matter what happens. Do not let emotions or media propaganda drag us into division. We must pray more and consume less of the noise from TV, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms. This noise distracts us from clear, spiritual thinking.

Let us enter the Great Land with faith and hope. May the Lord bless each of you. Amen.
