# Entrance to the Temple, and Expelling the Traders

Dear brothers and sisters, on December 4th, the Holy Church celebrates the Entrance of the Holy Theotokos into the Temple. This celebration continues until December 8th. Although this event is not recorded in Holy Scripture, the Church has preserved this tradition since ancient times, and it is certain that this event occurred. The Mother of God, the ever-virgin Mary, was brought into the Temple by her parents as their sacrifice to the Lord, in gratitude for hearing their prayers and granting them this only child in their later years.

Why is this event so significant? It is a great blessing that we celebrate this feast during Advent, as it is the only major feast observed during this season. This celebration has a profound connection to the Advent season. The Temple was the place where humans encountered God, a special presence of the Lord. Though God is omnipresent, the Holy Temple was a unique place of His presence, which is why it is called the Holy Temple, or "Iron, Kadosh." Within the Temple was the Holy of Holies, the most sacred space. Mary was taken into the Holy of Holies, a place reserved for the most sacred encounters with God.

This event was necessary to prepare the people to venerate the Holy and to understand that God is the supreme mystery. This preparation ultimately led to the union of God with humanity, so that everyone could become a Temple of God, a living dwelling place for the Holy Spirit. As Scripture says, "We will come and make our dwelling with them" (John 14:23). The Apostle Paul reminds us that our bodies are Temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). We must reflect deeply on how this relates to us.

The Mother of God entering the Temple signifies the beginning of a new era. She becomes the new Temple, as God will dwell in her first, enabling her to give birth to the Holy One, the Messiah. Through her, the path to the Messiah is opened, allowing humanity to unite with God. Mary signifies this new time when limited human beings—limited in body, life, and understanding—can become vessels of the unlimited, all-powerful, all-wise, and almighty God. At the same time, this event marks the impending abolition of the old Temple, as the Jewish leaders and many of the people had become unworthy of its sacred ministry.

The celebration of the Entrance of the Mother of God into the Temple is also connected to another event in a contrasting sense. While we celebrate Mary's entrance into the Holy of Holies, we are reminded of the time when Jesus drove out those who were buying, selling, and exchanging money in the Temple (Matthew 21:12-13). These individuals, ministers of Mammon, had turned the Temple into a den of thieves. We must be cautious, for we risk the same fate—not becoming Temples of God but instead driving Him away, just as He departed from the Jews and their Temple, which was soon destroyed.

How can we avoid this? Brothers and sisters, let us reflect deeply. First, on an individual level, we must strive to become Temples of God through holy living, obedience to God, and cleansing our souls from every defilement, evil thought, sinful intention, and practice. In this way, we prepare ourselves to be vessels of the Holy Spirit. However, this is not enough.

On the family level, I need to establish a small church. Whatever is not in line with life in Christ, I must address it to the best of my ability, recognizing that the family is not just about me. I must strive to ensure that Christ does not depart from my family. Then, on the level of the parish, the small church community, it requires everyone’s effort. We cannot simply wait for the priest to fix everything. It is the responsibility of each member to contribute to creating the Temple of God, the living Temple, within this community. Each of us must consider what we can do—what is required of me, of you. 

This extends to the broader church as well—the local church and ultimately the universal Church. Whenever something is not in line with Christ, whenever there is corruption, division, or domination, Christ begins to depart. He may leave me, my family, this parish, or even the local church. While He will not abandon the universal Church, He may withdraw from a local church if we fail to uphold His presence. 

What typically leads to this departure? Usually, it is three things. 

First, **mammon**—whether in the form of money, comfort, enjoyment, or earthly values. This often manifests in an excessive focus on economic matters. Like those who were buying and selling in the Temple, we might justify such actions by claiming they are for the benefit of the church, but in reality, they are driven by personal gain. When mammon becomes our god, Christ is no longer in our hearts. 

Second, the **will for power**. This can take the form of bureaucracy, democracy, or an overreliance on organizational structures. We may resort to voting, rules, and earthly systems to manage the church, forgetting that it is Christ who should guide us. When love and trust in Christ are replaced by human systems, the church becomes an empty framework, a mere human organization, potentially even guided by evil spirits. This is what happened with Catholics and Protestants, and there is a danger of it developing within the Orthodox Church as well. We must remain vigilant. While the Lord will not allow the entire Church to go astray, individuals can cause significant harm. We must begin with ourselves, avoiding judgment of others, but recognizing the risks at every level. The greatest risk lies in what is happening within me, not in what others are doing. 

Third, the intrusion of **politics** into our spiritual lives. This can occur on an individual level when we become obsessed with politics, prioritizing it over Christ. We may spend all our time reading and discussing politics, believing that it is politicians, not Christ, who control the world. This leads to dissatisfaction, idolization of certain leaders, and hatred for others. It can also manifest at the parish level, where political agendas or ideologies are preached from the pulpit. If a priest promotes political ideas, it is better to find another parish rather than allow such divisions to take root. Politics has no place in the church. We must not become preachers of any political agenda or ideology. We are children of the living God, and for us, Christ is everything. Everything that happens is about Christ. If we lose sight of this, He will depart from our temple, leaving it empty and meaningless, and it will eventually be abolished and destroyed. 

Brothers and sisters, let us think deeply about these things. Let us reflect on the Lord who is coming and ensure that we remain faithful vessels of His presence, both individually and collectively. Let us guard against mammon, the will for power, and the intrusion of politics, so that Christ may always dwell within us, our families, our parishes, and our churches.

If we have not chased away the things we have just mentioned—and there are more, but these are the main ones—then there is no need for us to celebrate the Entrance of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple. There is no need to celebrate Advent or to wait for Christmas. No need. We should not lie to ourselves. We are either with Christ, fully and without compromise, or we are with Mammon, with ourselves, enjoying our own well-being or suffering our own problems, but without Christ. Let us be honest with ourselves. Do we need Him? Do we find refuge in Him? Do we seek help from Him? Do we rely on Him in everything we do? If not, then we are not Christians.

May the Lord grant us pure hearts, help us cleanse away every defilement, every worldly thought and idea, and remain loyal to Him until the end. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
