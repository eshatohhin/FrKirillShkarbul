# Life goalsambitions of a Christian why do we live

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is the reason.  
The world has been going through turmoil for at least the past two years, and it is getting worse.  
Perhaps we do not know what to expect.  
During this time, many of us have been thinking about our future, the future of our families, and the future of our children.  
How do we decide which path to take? How do we make fundamental decisions?  
Should I change my job? Should I move to another country?  
Some are considering marriage.  
Many of us are in a state of internal questioning about our lives and the direction we should take.  
Should I change my way of life because I have become a Christian?  
Many questions arise.  
And for our children, too—what do we teach them?  
What should we do? How do we help them build their lives?  
If we do not know ourselves, how can we teach them anything or even allow them to grow and make their own decisions?  

If we are in the Lord, with the Lord, or striving to be with Him, we must reflect on these things.  
It is natural for people to plan and set goals.  
Otherwise, our life’s resources and energy are wasted because we lack direction.  
Therefore, there are things we must deeply consider if we want to follow Christ and make our lives meaningful in the eyes of the Lord.  

The first step is to break away from a flat, mundane life—a life where our heads are always down to earth, focused only on worldly concerns.  
We think, "I should buy this, I should go on vacation here, I should do that," without looking to the Lord and asking Him, "Why do I live? What is the purpose and direction of my life?"  
Instead, we push these questions aside. We may believe, and we may occasionally go to church, but faith becomes a separate reality from our daily lives.  
This is a grave mistake.  
It leads us into a cycle of spiritual struggles because we lack the right direction in both our lives and our spiritual journeys.  
Everything falls apart.  
If we do not reject God, He will allow our plans to fail.  
And indeed, many people today are experiencing depression and significant problems because their plans have failed—especially during these times of illness and hardship.  
Businesses have gone bankrupt, jobs have been lost, and lives have been broken.  
People had a vision of their future, but now it has been shattered.  

The first thing we must do is break free from this mindset.  
This means rejecting mammon.  
The reason we live such flat, unfulfilling lives is often because we serve mammon.  
What is mammon? It is the pursuit of happiness in this world.  
We think, "I just want a happy, peaceful, and joyful life here on earth, and that is my goal."  
We see it differently—some believe that having enough income to provide for their families and go on vacations brings happiness.  
Others aim for bigger goals, such as building wealth or acquiring real estate, believing that will bring them joy and fulfillment.  
Still, others seek fame, like having a popular blog with millions of subscribers, which satisfies their vanity.  
These are all forms of mammon—worldly pursuits of happiness and enjoyment that become the focus of our lives.  
We pour all our effort and energy into achieving these goals, but they are ultimately empty.  

Let us turn to Luke 16:25, where the Lord shares the parable of Lazarus and the rich man.  
We remember this story: the rich man lived a life of celebration and luxury, but after death, he found himself in torment.  
This parable reminds us of the fleeting nature of worldly pursuits and the importance of seeking eternal treasures in Christ.

But Lazarus, who was a beggar covered in wounds and sores, had nothing. He was constantly hungry.  
Yet, after his death, he was carried to the bosom of Abraham.  
In contrast, the rich man, who had lived a life of luxury, found himself in torment after death.  
There, he pleaded with Abraham to send Lazarus to bring him even a drop of water to cool his tongue and ease his suffering.  
But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are in agony."  

Isn’t this what we desire—to receive good things in this life?  
A peaceful vacation, a stable income, pension plans to secure a comfortable future, a fridge full of good food, a loving family, and the admiration of those around us.  
These are the simple things we dream of—a joyful and happy life every day.  
This is the dream many of us share, though we may envision it differently.  
But the parable shows us how such a life can end: in torment.  
"You received your good things already," Abraham says. "What more do you want? Now you are in agony because of the choices you made against God and His gospel."  

We often fail to recognize God’s daily mercies, squandering the blessings He has given us.  
We misuse them for perishable things, forgetting that we are not mere animals living only to eat and survive.  
We are called to live for higher values.  

The first step in our spiritual journey is to confront and reject the mammon mindset—the pursuit of worldly happiness and comfort.  
The Lord Himself said, "You cannot serve both God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24).  
This requires a fundamental shift in our values, goals, and ambitions.  
We must let go of the desire for earthly treasures and instead seek the eternal treasures of Christ.  

Let’s assume we’ve made this decision to reject mammon and live for Christ.  
This decision will not be easy, as it will likely bring opposition from those around us, even our own relatives.  
But if we persevere, we will face another challenge: the struggle with our passions.  
From childhood, we have been conditioned to seek carnal pleasures—vainglory, selfishness, and other sinful desires.  
These "snakes in our hearts" will resist our efforts to follow Christ on the narrow path to the kingdom of heaven.  

As we strive to live a spiritual life, fasting and praying, we will become increasingly aware of our inner ugliness and the depth of our sinful tendencies.  
Overcoming these habits will require immense effort and struggle.  
But let’s say we succeed in conquering these passions and eliminating major sinful habits.  
We are now more stable on our path to serving Christ.  

What challenges remain?  
Having escaped the "hellish life" of worldly pursuits, we may find ourselves in a spiritual desert—like the Israelites wandering without clear direction.  
Our jobs may no longer bring the same satisfaction, and we may question whether to continue on our current path or seek a new one.  
This is a critical stage in our spiritual journey, where we must seek God’s guidance to find our true purpose and direction.  

In this desert, we must rely on prayer, Scripture, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to lead us forward.  
The journey is not easy, but it is the path to true life in Christ.  
Let us remain steadfast, trusting in His promises and seeking His will above all else.

As we navigate this spiritual journey, two significant challenges await us.  
The first is the lack of spiritual guidance.  
The Lord calls us to "take up your cross and follow Me" (Matthew 16:24), but how do we follow Him in practical terms?  
What should we do each day? Should we stay in our current jobs and care for our families, or should we leave everything to serve as missionaries?  
These decisions require spiritual guidance—someone to help us discern God’s will through prayer, fasting, and dialogue with the Lord.  
Unfortunately, such guidance is often lacking in the Church today.  
Even priests may struggle with the same challenges we face, making it difficult for them to provide the direction we need.  
This is a profound problem that many of us encounter.  

The second challenge is the temptation to settle into a spiritual comfort zone.  
After escaping the "hellish life" of worldly pursuits, we may find ourselves on the narrow path but content to stay in a safe, familiar routine.  
For example, we might engage in a specific ministry, perform small acts of mercy, or maintain a consistent prayer life.  
While this is not inherently bad—it can even lead to salvation—it can also limit our spiritual growth.  
There is more we could do: we could take on greater responsibilities, face bigger challenges, and draw closer to God.  
By doing so, we not only grow spiritually but also become examples for others to follow Christ.  
This is the call to go beyond the "cocoon" of comfort and strive for the crowns the Lord has prepared for us.  

Returning to the fundamental question: What should we do with our lives?  
Should we stay in our current job or move to another country?  
These are big decisions, and to find answers, we can look to the lives of the saints.  
Their examples reveal how they lived for Christ and became holy.  

Consider the martyrs, both ancient and modern.  
There are two types of martyrs:  
1. Young individuals who came to faith and were martyred shortly after, often in their 20s or 30s.  
2. Older individuals who spent their entire lives serving Christ and were martyred in their mature or old age, like Saint Polycarp of Smyrna or many priests and bishops in Soviet Russia.  

Martyrdom is a great gift from the Lord, but it requires a life lived in Christ.  
Without such a life, one cannot receive this crown.  
The martyrs, whether young or old, were not focused on worldly careers or ambitions.  
Instead, they dedicated themselves to ministry and service to God.  

For those of us who may not be called to martyrdom, there is another path: the life of the righteous.  
The righteous are those who live holy lives, serving God and others through their daily actions.  
They may not face the extreme trials of martyrdom, but they too are called to live with purpose and devotion.  

In all these examples, the common thread is a life centered on Christ.  
Whether we are called to martyrdom, righteousness, or another path, our ultimate goal is to follow Him.  
This requires rejecting worldly pursuits, overcoming our passions, seeking spiritual guidance, and stepping out of our comfort zones.  
Let us strive to live lives that glorify God, trusting in His guidance and grace every step of the way.

The righteous—those who live holy lives—are often monastics or monks who abandon everything to dedicate themselves entirely to prayer and asceticism.  
They retreat to deserts or monasteries, spending their lives in communion with God.  
While we hope such individuals still exist today, the reality is that most churchgoers do not follow this path.  
Similarly, missionaries leave everything behind to spread the Gospel in distant lands.  
These are extraordinary callings, but they are not the only paths to holiness.  

When we examine the lives of the saints, we notice a common theme: none of them pursued worldly success as their primary goal.  
They did not build companies, achieve fame, or become renowned scientists as their life’s ultimate achievement.  
While some saints engaged in professions or pursuits that contributed to society, their focus was never on earthly accomplishments.  
Instead, they lived for today, striving to serve the Lord in the best way they could each day.  

For the saints, the question was never, "What are my long-term career goals?"  
They did not aspire to become famous, wealthy, or influential.  
Instead, their daily concern was how to serve God through their work, whether it was caring for others, conducting scientific research, or performing manual labor.  
They approached each day with the mindset of being ready to die at any moment, living in constant anticipation of Christ’s second coming.  

This perspective is rooted in the early Christian understanding that life on earth is temporary.  
Christians are called to live with their eyes fixed on eternity, longing for the eschatological union with Christ.  
Earthly achievements, no matter how grand, are fleeting.  
The true goal is to endure this life in a meaningful way, blessed by the Lord, while awaiting the ultimate reunion with Him.  

This mindset is what brings life to the soul and makes spiritual life successful.  
However, many baptized Christians today have not yet discovered the richness of spiritual and liturgical life.  
They remain disconnected from the Church and its transformative power.  
Others attend church but have not experienced the renewal that comes from a deep relationship with the Lord.  
Some, though renewed, struggle with depression or lack guidance, causing their faith to grow dim and their love for the Lord to wane.  

Yet, there are those who have discovered the fire of the Holy Spirit and are motivated to serve the Lord daily.  
These individuals are rare, but they exemplify the life we are called to live.  
It is important to discern whether the fire within us is the true fire of the Holy Spirit or a misguided zeal that leads us astray.  

In summary, the key to a fulfilling Christian life is to live each day in service to the Lord, free from the pursuit of worldly success.  
We must focus on eternal goals, remain steadfast in prayer, and seek guidance from the Holy Spirit.  
By doing so, we can avoid the pitfalls of spiritual stagnation and grow closer to Christ, becoming living examples of His love and grace.

Indeed, there are those who possess great zeal, but their zeal is misguided—rooted in vainglory, a misunderstanding of the Holy Fathers, or other errors.  
They are eager to do extraordinary things for God, but their actions lack discernment and wisdom.  
This is zeal without understanding, leading to reckless or harmful behavior.  
Such individuals, though passionate, risk causing harm to themselves and others.  

In our pastoral and spiritual lives, we face many challenges in guiding people toward the right path.  
We must help them cultivate a balanced zeal—one that is rooted in humility, love, and a deep understanding of God’s will.  
This requires patience, prayer, and a commitment to teaching the truth with clarity and compassion.  

Let us reflect on these challenges and strive to adopt the right mindset and direction in our lives.  
We must ask ourselves: What is the purpose of my life? Where am I headed? How can I arrange my life to align with God’s will?  
Whether we have many years ahead or only a few, we must be prepared to live them in a way that is spiritually sound and strong.  

May the Lord grant us the vision to see His will, the zeal to pursue it, and the love to serve Him with our whole hearts.  
Let us find joy in suffering, knowing that it is through trials that we grow closer to Him.  
As we see in the story of Lazarus, suffering in this life can lead to greater reward in the next.  
We should not seek suffering, but we must be ready to endure it if it comes our way.  

Our hearts must be prepared for all kinds of trials and tribulations.  
We should not live in fear of suffering, nor should we constantly dream of a peaceful, comfortable life free from hardship.  
Such dreams can lead us astray, as they did the rich man in the Gospel of Luke.  
Instead, let us fix our eyes on Christ, detaching ourselves from the allure of worldly comforts and attaching ourselves solely to Him.  

May the Lord guide us, give us direction, and help us separate from everything that distracts us from Him.  
Let us be drawn only to our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the source of all life, joy, and salvation.  

Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!  
Amen.
