# Faith and Nationality

Dear brothers and sisters, the issues related to nationality and ethnic background are not something that concerns a Christian, especially an Orthodox Christian, because for Christ, there is no nationality.  
Actually, the Apostle Paul says there is no gender in Christ either.  
For a Christian, from the earliest times, what has been important is receiving Christ and receiving His grace. It was not important which nation you came from.  
We see in the very early Church that Christians came from both Jews and Gentiles—two broad categories.  
But very soon, even these distinctions disappeared, and the True Church became universal, even though it was present in different countries.  
At that time, the majority of Christians were in the Roman Empire, but they were also in other places—Persia, India, Armenia, and other regions that were not part of the Roman Empire.  

Why do I want to talk about this problem? There are several reasons. Recently, some people have been asking me, "We have Orthodox countries at war with each other, and different Orthodox nations fighting against one another."  
We also face the issue of immigration. Some countries that were traditionally Christian—such as those in Europe, Russia, the United States, and Greece—are now receiving people from all over the world.  
This has led to a pluralistic society, and in some places, Christians are even being replaced by Muslims.  
This poses a significant threat and challenge to the Church and to Christian identity.  

Therefore, there is a need to clarify certain things. First, it is important to distinguish between two tendencies.  
The first tendency is what we might call conservative nationalism. This perspective holds that, for example, if you are Serbian and Orthodox, there should not be too many people from other places in Serbia or in Serbian communities in the U.S.  
This group believes that maintaining a more closed community will help preserve the identity, Christianity, and Orthodoxy of the group.  
This idea is present among some Orthodox groups, whether Serbian, Bulgarian, or even Russian, particularly within Russia itself.  

On the other side of the spectrum, there is the cosmopolitan tendency, sometimes referred to as the "Ouranopolis" perspective.  
This view holds that your citizenship is in heaven, and therefore, your earthly background—your nation, ethnicity, or homeland—does not matter at all.  
According to this perspective, you should sever any ties to your earthly identity and consider yourself a "citizen of the world."  

Let us take a closer look at both of these tendencies, because both are flawed and lead to anti-Christian outcomes.  
The first tendency, conservative nationalism, resembles Old Testament logic. It is rooted in fear—fear that other nations will bring their religions into our group, that we will mix with them, and that we will be corrupted by their faith, culture, or traditions.  
This fear stems from a lack of faith and worldliness. When we are weak in faith and do not feel the grace of the Lord, we become obsessed with preserving something external, fearing that we will betray the faith of our forefathers.  

The early Church did not have this problem. In the early Church, the grace that came upon those who called themselves Christians was so powerful that they were not overly concerned with whether someone was Syrian, Arab, Armenian, or from any other background.  
For them, these distinctions were not irrelevant, but they were not obsessed with them either. They understood that these were external matters.  
In terms of salvation, Church life, and faith, these issues are secondary.  

Both tendencies—conservative nationalism and cosmopolitanism—fail to grasp the true nature of Christian identity.  
The first focuses too much on preserving external distinctions, while the second dismisses them entirely.  
As Orthodox Christians, we must find a balance, recognizing that our ultimate citizenship is in heaven, while also valuing the unique cultural and national expressions of faith that have been passed down to us.  
Our faith is universal, yet it is lived out in diverse ways across different nations and cultures.  
Let us not be driven by fear or worldly ideologies but remain rooted in the grace and truth of Christ, who transcends all earthly divisions.

For example, I don’t know—how many brothers and sisters do you have? Is this fundamentally important for your salvation? Probably not.  
In the same way, your ethnicity is not fundamentally important for your salvation. What matters is that you know your faith, remain loyal to Christ, live by His word every day of your life, and strive to embody His teachings.  
This is what makes you a Christian, and this is what truly matters.  

This is why the Old Testament logic is no longer necessary. It is no longer essential to rely so heavily on fixed forms, traditions, or ethnic conservatism.  
These things became less relevant for the Church. The more we restore our relationship with the Lord and the more alive our faith becomes, the less important these external distinctions will be.  

At the same time, let us examine the other end of the spectrum.  
The ideas of Uranopolitanism or Cosmopolitanism may appear more Christian at first glance, but they are rooted in liberalism, anti-Christian logic, and transhumanist, postmodernist thinking.  
This logic insists that you must emancipate yourself from everything—your national identity, ethnic background, cultural heritage, gender, family, and even your humanity.  
It promotes the idea that you must transcend all these things, becoming "superhuman," rising above nations, traditions, and history, which it dismisses as irrelevant or outdated.  

This is a Gnostic and fundamentally anti-Christian, anti-human logic. It attempts to exploit the Christian idea that everyone equally belongs to the Kingdom of God, twisting it to pull Christians toward a transhumanist, liberal, and cosmopolitan worldview.  
This mindset is particularly common among immigrants, though not all. Many immigrants experience a kind of "immigrant syndrome," where they convince themselves and others that leaving their homeland was the right decision.  
They may portray their country of origin as backward or hopeless, while idealizing their new country as a paradise.  

This, too, is wrong, and here’s why.  
There are saints who have said that if you do not love your earthly homeland, you will not love your heavenly homeland.  
So where does the truth lie? The truth does not come from human reasoning or logical gymnastics. The solution comes from the Lord and the Gospel.  

In Matthew 12:48–50, we see an example of this. When Christ’s mother and brothers came to speak with Him while He was teaching in a house full of disciples, someone informed Him, "Your mother and brothers are outside, asking to speak with You."  
Christ responded, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?" Then, gesturing to His disciples, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother."  

Christ was speaking about relatives, but the same principle applies to nations.  
Who are our fellow citizens? Not merely those of the same ethnic or national origin, but those who love Christ and strive to accomplish His will, dedicating their lives and sacrificing themselves for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven.  
These are the people who belong to the same spiritual nation as us.  

At the same time, this does not mean that Christ disregarded His physical family.  
We know that He honored His mother, listened to her advice, and even performed His first miracle at her request at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, turning water into wine.  
He showed piety and respect toward His earthly family, demonstrating that earthly ties, while secondary to our spiritual calling, are not without value.  

The truth, therefore, lies in balance. We must not idolize our earthly identities, nor should we reject them entirely.  
Our ultimate allegiance is to Christ and His Kingdom, but this does not negate the value of our cultural, national, and familial heritage.  
Instead, these earthly ties should be sanctified and transformed by our faith, becoming instruments through which we glorify God and serve His purposes.  

Let us strive to live in this balance, rooted in the Gospel and guided by the grace of the Lord, so that we may truly become citizens of His heavenly Kingdom while honoring the earthly gifts He has given us.

So, it is not that Christ disregarded His mother or brothers, but rather that their importance was secondary compared to whether someone was listening to the Word of God and following Him.  
The same principle applies to us. For us, what matters most is whether someone comes to the Church, loves Christ, and desires to live according to His Word.  
It does not matter if they are black, white, Asian, Filipino, from Papua New Guinea, from the jungle, or an Eskimo from the North Pole.  
We do not care about these distinctions. What matters is that they become closer to us by drawing closer to God.  
We become one in Christ when we partake of His true Body and Blood in the Eucharist. This unity is far more fundamental than any earthly distinction.  

In the Gospel of Mark (11:17), the Lord teaches, "Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations’?"  
The temple of God is a place of worship for all nations, and the Church is the temple of God—the holy Church that unites all nations.  
This does not mean that people lose their nationality when they come to Christ. They remain part of their nations, but they become one in Christ, forming one Church.  
In the same way, becoming a Christian does not erase your family relationships. You still have your father, mother, children, brothers, and sisters.  
These relationships remain, and in fact, you may become a better son, parent, or sibling as a Christian.  

Similarly, if you are Chinese, Indonesian, or from any other nation, you become a better representative of your culture when you become a Christian.  
This does not mean adopting a cosmopolitan mindset that rejects your heritage. Instead, it means discerning what in your culture aligns with Christ and what does not.  
Some nations, such as those in Europe, Russia, Syria, or Egypt, have a rich Christian history. These cultures naturally cherish the Christian elements within their traditions.  
Other nations, such as those in China, Southeast Asia, or Africa, may not have a strong Christian background, but they still possess valuable elements that reflect the presence of the Logos, the Word of God, in their cultures.  

For example, when analyzing Confucian texts, we find many teachings that promote virtue and are compatible with Christianity.  
At the same time, there are elements in these cultures that are pagan or incompatible with the Gospel.  
A Christian who is ethnically Chinese, for instance, must carefully discern and root out un-Christian aspects of their culture while valuing those that align with the teachings of Christ.  

This discernment is crucial as we face the challenges of the 21st century, which is increasingly characterized by cultural mixing and the erosion of traditional identities.  
In many places, we see a "Babylon" of cultures melting together, with original cultures disappearing and being replaced by a shallow, postmodern, pseudo-culture that is often anti-Christian.  
These trends will only grow in scale and scope, making it essential for us to remain wise, humble, and loving.  

We must extend love to everyone, including those who do not yet love God.  
We should welcome them with open hearts, not just as individuals but as souls in need of Christ’s light.  
While our greatest love and trust are reserved for our brothers and sisters in Christ, we must also show great compassion and love for those outside the Church—whether they follow other religions, hold heretical beliefs, or have no faith at all.  
We love them deeply, pray for them, and are even willing to sacrifice ourselves for their salvation.  

Let us, therefore, strive to be faithful witnesses of Christ in this complex and changing world.  
Let us embrace the diversity of cultures while remaining rooted in the truth of the Gospel.  
Let us love all people, both within and outside the Church, and work tirelessly to bring them closer to the Kingdom of Heaven.  
In doing so, we fulfill Christ’s commandment to love one another as He has loved us, and we become true citizens of His eternal Kingdom.

We hope that they will one day be united with us in Christ.  
May the Lord grant us humility, wisdom, and the ability to discern what is truly important from what is secondary.  
Teach us to love our own culture and heritage, but never at the expense of loving Christ and being wholly dedicated to His Kingdom and to the mystical Body of Christ, which is the Holy Church.  

God bless you, brothers and sisters. Amen.
