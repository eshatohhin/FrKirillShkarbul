# The Entrance to Jerusalem & Weakening of Faith

Dear brothers and sisters, today the Holy Church celebrates the entrance of the Lord into Jerusalem, and this brings us to another topic.  
There is a wealth of material about the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem—exegetical, pastoral, biblical, and all kinds of resources.  
So, I will not focus solely on this. Today, I also want to talk about the coldness of faith—the problem of why faith seems weaker in our days compared to the early times of Christianity.  
This does not mean that God is absent or that the Church has fundamentally changed. It is still the same Church.  
What does this mean? How has this come about?  
First, what do I mean when I say there is a weakening of faith?  
In the early Church, we see that people prayed all night, every day. Many people surrendered everything for Christ and His ministry.  
They sold all they had and held everything in common. They did not claim, "This is mine, this is yours."  
They were occupied with the Word of God and acts of mercy throughout the day.  
When others encountered a Christian community, they recognized it as holy—a gathering of saints.  
They either joined and experienced a profound transformation or stayed away, unable to remain indifferent.  
There are many other examples. When they fasted, they abstained from food for many days.  
When they prayed, miracles happened. They prayed for healing, and healing occurred.  
They prayed for resurrection, and the dead were raised. They moved mountains by faith—both allegorically and, in some cases, literally.  
There are records of mountains moving and the sun reversing its course.  
We read about such wonders in the lives of the holy fathers.  
When we study their spiritual writings, we find them filled with grace.  
We do not see such things happening in our time.  
So, the question arises: Why is this the case? Why is there such a difference?  
The answer is that the Church has not changed in its essence.  
It has preserved the faith of the apostles and the access to all the gifts of grace that the Lord is willing to give us.  
Has the Lord's hand grown weaker? Has His grace diminished?  
No. His hand is as mighty as it has always been, and His grace is as abundant as ever.  
But we are not receiving it—we are not willing to receive this grace to the extent we could.  
It is not that we cannot, but rather that we are not ready or willing.  
All of this remains available to us. However, people are not as eager to receive what is offered.  
It is like having a treasure chest passed down to you.  
If you are a woman, you could adorn yourself with its riches and become beautiful.  
Or it is like a toolbox filled with useful tools handed down to you.  
But if you do not know how to use them—whether a laser or something else—they are of no use.  
Many who come to the Church do not learn how to use these spiritual tools.  
Even priests and monks sometimes fail to utilize them to their full potential.  
So, what is the reason? The reason is directly connected to the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem.  
The primary factor, the source of this ability, lies in repentance.  
What we lack today is deep, true repentance. Repentance means turning away from our selfishness and sins,  
making a breakthrough, fixing our eyes on the Lord, and serving Him.  
As fallen people, we are selfish. We care about our own benefit, well-being, and happiness.  
We ask, "What will make me happy?" People search for answers: "Where should I go? What vacation should I take?  
How should I spend my time to get the most out of it? How can I live a healthier life?"  
We are consumed by concern for our selfish desires. And this is why we are losing the truth.

And including most of the faithful—most Christians—they have property, salaries, and possessions.  
We have these things too. And when we are bound by them, we are bound by all this materialistic, worldly, earthly stuff.  
We are defined by it—by who we are, what is in our resume, who we know, who can help us, our bills, our rights, and so on.  
All these earthly concerns. This is what happened during the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem.  
The people who greeted Him said, "Yes, yes, You are the Messiah because You resurrected Lazarus and performed miracles.  
Yes, come in, come in." This was the attitude of Israel at that time.  
But when the Lord entered, they became disappointed. Within a few days, they cried the exact opposite: "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!  
We want Barabbas, not this one." This happens with every one of us, including all the faithful.  
I am speaking about Orthodox Christians. We sin. Why do we sin?  
We sin because of this. We switch back and forth.  
There is a lot of this within us. In the heart—Jerusalem represents the heart—the Lord seeks to enter.  
He needs to enter our hearts. But many voices within us cry, "No, no, we don't want Him."  
This is the great problem. If we repent deeply, weep over our sins, and truly reject all selfishness, casting it aside to focus solely on the Lord,  
making Him our aim and learning how to serve Him, forgetting about ourselves and our own agendas,  
only then will we gain true life and true faith. The Lord will be with us,  
and His great power will transform us and the reality around us.  
This is preserved within the whole Church. Outside, you see many groups, sects, heresies,  
and even communists who have zeal and a willingness to act, to overthrow the world, to start revolutions, and so on.  
Why are they so active while we are so passive? Their activity and zeal are fueled by mammon, by the devil.  
Why? Because they lack repentance. If you look deeply, there is no repentance, no confession,  
no weeping over sins, no self-condemnation.  
This flame, this zeal, comes from somewhere else—not from the Lord.  
When we begin to fight against our passions, we often feel weak and unable to act.  
This is because we lack the driving force of misguided passion.  
For us to bear the fruits of faith, we must take one step further.  
This is illustrated by the Lord sitting on the donkey.  
The donkey represents the material world, the earthly realm, and the passions we struggle with.  
The Lord subdues all of this. He is the victor. His entrance is triumphant, which is why palm branches were laid before Him.  
When a king enters in triumph, palm branches are used to honor him.  
So, He enters as the triumphant King, the conqueror. He has overcome the material world and the prince of this world.  
But many people are unwilling to follow Him all the way. They do not understand what is happening.  
Even the apostles did not fully grasp it at first. They later realized that this was foretold in the prophecy of Zechariah.  
The donkey also carries significant symbolism. It represents stubborn humanity, unwilling to submit,  
yet the Lord takes it and uses it to serve Him, raising it to Jerusalem.

So during this time—now that the 40 days of Lent are over and we have entered Holy Week—  
we must transition from being like the donkey, from being animalistic and stubborn, to becoming free in the Lord.  
We must become truly human, made in the likeness of the Lord. We need to gain this spiritual freedom  
and the decisiveness to no longer be governed by the laws of this earthly world.  
We see this illustrated in the Gospel of John, chapter 12, where it is written that some of the rulers believed in Christ but kept it secret.  
Why? Because they loved the glory of this world more than the glory of God.  
They were afraid of losing their positions, becoming marginalized, losing their salaries, and being despised by others.  
They were unwilling to go all the way. If you believe, you must be ready to throw everything away and do what the Lord commands.  

The Word of God is clear and sometimes painful. The Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world" (John 12:31).  
What judgment? The judgment is that everyone must make a choice. It is either this or that—there is no middle ground.  
You are either with the Lord or you are not. It is not enough to say, "Oh yes, I believe."  
We must make a decisive commitment. You are either with Him or you are not.  
If you are with Him to the end, you must allow His grace to burn away everything in your heart that opposes Him.  
If there is something you still treasure, something you cling to, you must let it go.  
Only then can you enter the Kingdom of Heaven with the Lord, as He enters Jerusalem.  
Only then can the Lord dwell in your heart and live within you.  

This is what grants us the great gifts of the Holy Spirit that we see in the early Church.  
There is no other path to true mysticism. The reason we lack these gifts is our indecisiveness,  
our lack of repentance, and our worldliness. We still want to serve the prince of this world—our corrupted, selfish, egotistical selves.  

Let us make this decision. Let us be ready to stand with the Lord no matter the cost.  
We must be willing to lose everything, even our lives, to be with Him to the end.  
We must make Him the main priority in our lives, above all else.  
Only then will we see the fruits of grace grow and increase within us, in our hearts, and in our lives.  

May the Lord be with us, help us, and give us this flame of faith.  
May He make it stronger, firmer, and drive us every day of our lives to serve Him and Him alone.  
God bless.
