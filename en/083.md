# What language to use for prayer and Liturgy

Dear brothers and sisters, what kind of language should we use when we talk to God, when we pray? Should we use our own words? Should we use prayer books, modern prayers, or ancient prayers? What kind of language should we use for the Divine Liturgy? Sometimes we hear language that we don't understand, perhaps Greek, Old English, Slavonic, Hebrew, or Latin. 

To better answer this question, we need to first recall that our God, Jesus Christ, is the Word of God, the Divine Word, the Word of God the Father. Therefore, word and language are very important; they are what make us human, created in the image of God, who is the Word. Our ability to speak is crucial. Speech and language are not merely about conveying information. When we translate a prayer into different languages or use different styles of language, it is not the same. A prayer in Greek, the same prayer in English, Russian, or Chinese, is different. It is the same prayer, but it has different aspects to it. Each language has its limits, talents, strengths, and weaknesses in terms of linguistics, grammar, and the spirit it can express—depth, poetics, and many other things. 

This is why it is important, when we think about translating Holy Scripture or prayers of the Holy Fathers, to pay attention to all these aspects. We should not think that we can mechanically translate one thing into another or that it is merely the same information. It is much deeper than that. 

Having said this, we also need to recall that Christ is a mystery. He told his disciples that to those outside, everything is in parables. He revealed the true meaning of these parables only to his disciples, uncovering the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, the mysteries. However, this is not occultism. The kingdom is not some secret knowledge reserved for the chosen few, for the very special ones. For us, union with Christ is also for the chosen ones, but the difference is that it is offered to everyone. It is directed at everyone, and everyone has the potential to become a child of God. It is not exclusive, unlike occultism. Yet, very few people truly hear the word of God and are willing to enter into this union with Him. 

This understanding helps us determine what kind of language and prayers we should use in our daily prayers at home and in the Divine Liturgy. In our prayers at home, it is important that our hearts speak to God. Our direct language, whatever is in our minds and hearts, is very precious and important to Him when we express it to our Lord. He listens to these prayers. However, sometimes we feel that we don't know what to say. We might say a few words: "Lord, have mercy," "Thank you, Lord," "Glory be to God," or prayers of repentance like, "Please forgive me, O Lord." These very simple prayers are extremely important. We should use them many times during the day, thinking about God and praying to Him frequently. 

Yet, sometimes we want to say more. We want to have a deeper conversation with God, to express more, but we lack the words or know-how. When we open prayer books with prayers written by holy people, ascetics, and holy fathers hundreds of years ago, we can learn from them what it means to talk to God. We can discover the problems within ourselves that we need to address to God, issues we might not even notice or know how to express. We can also learn what pleases God and what does not. All of these things we can learn from these prayers.

So it is very useful for us; the prayer book becomes like a school of spiritual life. While we read these prayers, our hearts should participate in every word. It is not enough to simply think, "Oh, I'm supposed to read these prayers in the morning, okay, now I just read them and move on." This has no meaning. Our hearts must actively engage, making these prayers our own. This is crucial for our spiritual growth. Both personal prayer and the use of prayer books are important because prayer is a dialogue between two hearts. 

This dialogue deepens when we go to church. In the church, we are not just individuals talking to God. We participate in a mystery, entering into union with Christ, who is incarnate in the gathered church. This sacrament, this mysterious reality, is happening, and we become part of it. To participate, we must open our hearts and enter into this mystery. It is not merely an exchange of information or a dialogue; it is a mystical reality we step into. 

To help people enter into this reality, the church often uses chanting. It is not enough to simply say words to God. God looks at our hearts. When we chant, our hearts open. It is not just about our minds, logic, or information; it is about our hearts opening to God. Sometimes, we may not even understand the meaning of the chants, especially if they are in a foreign language or are so lengthy that we lose track of the words. Yet, we can still penetrate the prayer. Of course, it is helpful to learn the meaning of the chants, as this aids our participation, but it is not absolutely necessary. We can still enter into prayer without fully understanding every word. 

For example, we had an English-speaking person join our parish when we were using only Chinese and Church Slavonic. He already had liturgical experience and understood the structure and meaning of the divine service. He said he could enter into the prayer even without understanding the specific words being chanted. He asked us not to use English just for his sake, as he wanted to become part of the sacrament and divine service without knowing the exact meaning of the chants. 

From this, we learn that participation in the divine service is not just about following a book or understanding every word. It is about our hearts being united with Christ in this mystery. If we attend a service in a language we do not understand—whether in Greece, Russia, China, or elsewhere—we can still participate to a large extent. However, it is important to study the divine service, its structure, and its theology. Knowing the verbal meaning of each part helps us take the next step in our spiritual journey. 

The language of the divine service is not just ordinary language. It is the incarnation of the Word of God into human words and letters. This makes these divine texts profoundly significant. We must be very careful when translating them into other languages or adapting them, ensuring that their sacred essence is preserved.
