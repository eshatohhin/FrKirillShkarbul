# How to identify Spirituality

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about spirituality, because very often we hear terms like "spiritual father," "spiritual life," and "how to become more spiritual." It may seem that we are discussing something very abstract or mystical, far removed from our daily lives. However, this is not the case. It is crucial for us to distinguish true spirituality from false or fake spirituality.

Often, we listen to lectures, watch videos, or read articles and ask ourselves: Is this person truly spiritual? Are they conveying genuine spirituality, or is it something else? To answer this, there are a few key points we must consider.

First, what is spirituality itself? Spirituality cannot be determined by external factors. For example, a person's speaking style, charisma, or rhetorical skills—such as being highly persuasive, talented in argumentation, or adept at providing examples—do not necessarily indicate spirituality. We must remember that Moses, for instance, was not an eloquent speaker; he had a speech impediment and often struggled to communicate clearly. Yet, he was chosen by God. Similarly, when we encounter individuals who may not speak eloquently, we should not dismiss their potential to convey meaningful or important truths.

Spirituality is something that originates directly from God, for God is spirit. It transcends our physical, intellectual, and even artistic categories. It goes beyond what we can fully grasp or comprehend. Therefore, we must set aside our usual human methods of judgment. For example, we might admire a professor for their knowledge, confidence, and ability to convey information effectively. However, spirituality does not operate in the same way. It is even more misguided when someone attempts to feign spirituality by adopting a particular manner of speaking or presenting themselves in a certain way. Such external displays hold no value in the eyes of the Lord.

What, then, is meaningful to the Lord? Determining what is truly spiritual is not easy for us because, to discern spirituality, we must ourselves be spiritual—and we are not. This is evident in the existence of numerous religions, sects, and denominations, all reading the same Bible yet interpreting it differently. The challenge lies in identifying what truly comes from the Lord.

Since there are no external criteria for determining whether something is spiritual, we must evaluate whether it aligns with the Word of God, the Holy Scripture. This is the fundamental principle. As the Apostle Paul writes in Hebrews 4:12, "For the word of God is alive and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." These are the qualities of the Word of God, which is inherently spiritual because it comes from God. It acts as a judge, discerning good from evil, truth from falsehood, and what pleases God from what does not.

When we encounter the Word of God, it is as though we are being examined by God Himself. Anything that does not align with His Word is subject to judgment and correction. This can be uncomfortable, even painful, because we live in a carnal world—a world of the soul, where cultural elements like music and art may seem elevated but are not inherently spiritual. True spirituality transcends these realms and connects us directly to the divine.

But this "higher" is not spirit. This is not spirituality. Some people say, "Oh, that's spirituality," when they attend a classical music concert. No, it is not. Spirituality is something entirely different. We live in a reality where such distinctions are often blurred. When something truly spiritual enters this reality, it acts like a sharp sword, cutting through and separating what is genuine from what is not. This is an inherent quality of any spiritual content—whether it is a lecture, a movie, a story, or an article. It judges us, and this judgment can be uncomfortable. This is why the prophets were often unwelcome when they preached, and why many of them were stoned. People are generally unwilling to listen to spiritual content because it challenges them. It is not like attending a pop concert, where thousands gather for entertainment. True spirituality will never attract such crowds because people do not want to be judged. They prefer to remain in the shadows of their current reality.

The defining characteristic of spiritual content is its ability to judge and reveal truth. Another way to discern whether something is spiritual is to ask: Does it feel pleasing to God? How do we know this? Through the experience of repentance and penitence. We can even ask ourselves: Would this speaker repent? Can we imagine them humbling themselves before God? When we engage with spiritual content, we should reflect on whether it aligns with our own experience of repentance. Does it conflict with what we know to be true? Is it a different spirit altogether?

What does repentance feel like? When we truly repent, we experience three things. First, we feel the need to discard all that is wrong—wrong behavior, wrong ideas, and wrong values. We cut ties with these things and cast them away. Second, we feel a sense of release and relief, as if a heavy burden has been lifted. We are freed from the weight of our mistakes. Third, we feel a renewed sense of responsibility. We recognize that we are now aligned with God, and we desire to live this new life faithfully. These three feelings—rejection of sin, relief, and responsibility—are the hallmarks of genuine repentance. Any spiritual content we encounter should resonate with these feelings and not contradict them.

For example, if the content is overly romantic—filled with visions of "loving Jesus" in a sentimental way—it may feel disconnected from the sober reality of repentance. Such romanticism can lead us into a fairy-tale mindset, which is not true spirituality. Similarly, if the content carries a spirit of legalism or Pharisee-like judgment—focusing on strict adherence to rules without love or compassion—we sense that the spirit of God is absent. Instead, we feel hostility or division, which is contrary to the nature of God.

The danger lies not in living without God, as many people do, but in believing that we are spiritual or living with God when, in fact, we are not. This is far worse. It is a counterfeit spirituality—a substitute or surrogate that deceives us into thinking we are living a religious life. This is the most perilous situation because it involves another spirit, not the Spirit of God. It pulls us away from the truth and leads us astray.

This is why we must be vigilant and discerning. It is better to have no spirituality at all than to embrace a false or fake version. If we find ourselves entangled in such deception, we must cast it aside entirely and return to a place of honesty, even if it means starting over without any pretense of spirituality. True spirituality is rooted in the Word of God, aligns with the experience of repentance, and reflects the love, humility, and truth of the Lord. Anything less is a dangerous imitation.

And start from scratch. Begin anew, seeking and moving forward. What else is important to address? We must not fall into the trap of searching for a specific speaker or preacher, thinking, "I need to find a truly spiritual person." A truly spiritual person is one in whom the Spirit of God dwells constantly, someone in whom Christ lives at all times. However, such individuals are rare and difficult to find. We should not spend our energy seeking them out. Instead, we must focus on discerning whom to listen to and whom to avoid.

How do we decide which speakers or preachers to follow? At the very least, we should determine whether the person is genuinely striving to deliver God's message. Are they honestly sharing what they have learned and read? Are they free from arrogance, performance-driven motives, selfishness, or pride? A true messenger of God is humble and sincere, simply aiming to convey the message of God without adding personal agendas or distortions. They remain orthodox in their teachings, ensuring that no foreign spirit is mixed into the message. Such individuals can provide nourishment for our spiritual lives.

This does not mean we reject all other sources of knowledge or experience. We can learn from various people and contexts, as they share their insights and experiences. However, such learning is more for educational purposes rather than spiritual growth. We must distinguish between the two. While we remain open to knowledge, we must be cautious and discerning when it comes to spiritual content.

Let us also strive to become messengers of the Lord ourselves. We do not need to wait until we feel Christ is fully present in us before we share His message. Christ calls everyone to be His witnesses. We are to testify to what we have honestly discovered in the Gospel and in our spiritual lives. We test these truths through daily practices—prayer, fasting, and other disciplines—and share our experiences with others. We should not delay, thinking, "Only when I am perfectly spiritual will I be ready to share." No, Christ sends us all, urging us to be His witnesses wherever we are. We must do our best to share His message, striving to avoid mistakes but understanding that growth comes through effort. If we never try, we will never learn.

Let us be eager in this ministry, unafraid and confident that the Lord's blessing and His mighty hand will be with us. Amen.
