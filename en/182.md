# How to deal with reality and get ready for the end of times

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about how to deal with what is happening and what is coming, because we see that the world is changing. There is a significant transformation taking place, and Christians—Orthodox Christians in particular—feel that things are not all rosy and pleasant. They sense that something closer to an apocalypse is approaching, that the new world will not be a utopia or a paradise, but rather a more anti-Christian world. This is already happening on a global scale.

Let me share an analogy. In one hall that I frequently visit, there is always a cleaning person at work. Often, you don’t see the cleaner, but you know she is approaching because you hear the noise of the vacuum cleaner growing louder and louder. You don’t see her yet, but you know she is coming. Similarly, for those who are spiritually attuned, they can hear the "noise" of the antichrist approaching, of dark times on the horizon. We don’t see it yet, but we sense that it is coming. I’ve spoken about this before, but today I want to focus on our attitude—how we should deal with this reality and the stress that comes from the news we hear, as well as the spiritual "garbage" we absorb through advertisements, the internet, movies, and other sources. There is so much harmful content that wounds and damages us, often coming through the people we interact with. How do we face this new world, this uncertain future?

First, let us turn to the prophet Isaiah, chapter 1, verses 18-20. The Lord says, "Come now, and let us reason together," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken." The sword, wars, viruses, famine, nuclear weapons, and all the threats we hear about—these are what lie ahead if we do not repent. This will be the outcome. You might ask, "Even if I repent, and these things don’t happen to me, they will still happen to the world. So how do I live with this?"

The Lord provides guidance. First, He promises to cleanse our sins—not only our sins but also all the spiritual garbage we carry that He does not need. He will clean it away, just as one cleans a table, leaving a fresh, clear surface. This is what must happen to us if we live a spiritual life: we must undergo renewal. The Apostle Paul urges us to "renew our minds." This renewal comes through the power of the resurrection, if we are willing to receive it. This simplifies things greatly, because we often make life too complicated. International economics, political struggles, power dynamics—it all seems so overwhelming. But for Christians, the approach is simpler. We must face these challenges with a clean conscience and a fresh, healthy perspective. This does not mean we should be naive or accept everything we are told. No, we are guided by the Holy Gospel, and we stand firm in our faith.

The first step is to approach these challenges without fear. Fear arises when we are too attached to the things of this world. We worry: What if I lose my job? What if I lose my home? What if my children cannot go to school? What if there is an economic collapse? What if I am controlled through electronic currency or social ratings? These fears consume us. But the answer is simple: do not fear. Let go of fear. Trust in the Lord and His promises. Live with faith, not with anxiety. This is the way forward.

Whatever is coming, whatever the Lord allows to happen, will happen. We do not want this anti-Christian world to emerge, and we do everything within our power to resist it. As soldiers of Christ, we fight against evil and do not want it to become all-encompassing. For example, in China—not Taiwan—it is already forbidden to preach the Gospel freely. I cannot go to China now to preach or conduct divine services. Priests are restricted from performing their duties. What is this if not the agenda of the antichrist? In many Muslim countries, the situation is similar. People are imprisoned not only for baptizing others but even for being baptized themselves. Naturally, few are willing to go there to preach or even speak openly. This is the reality we face.

If this kind of totalitarian control—social ratings, surveillance of our actions, thoughts, and relationships—becomes the norm worldwide, of course, we do not want it. But if, despite our efforts to resist, this still comes to pass because the Lord allows it, then we must face it. We will find ourselves in such a world and must bear witness to our faith within it, no matter how hostile it may be. Consider the early Christians. They were born into a world that hated Christianity, where it was illegal, and pagans were aggressively opposed to it. Yet they faced it courageously. We have relics of saints like Saint Agnes, who was martyred at the age of 12, and countless other examples. They bore witness to their faith and sacrificed their lives for it.

The main difference between us and them is that we are attached to this world. We love our comforts—our coffee, our conveniences—and feel that our world will collapse without them. We must free ourselves from such attachments. Only then can we rise above any shackles that seek to bind us. Like doves escaping as the gates close, the Lord will enable us to escape if we repent and live in repentance. We must not cling to the comforts of our old lives. We must be free from them.

The Apostle Paul said, "We are poor, yet we make many rich; we have nothing, and yet we possess everything." For us, however, we often cling to our possessions, our rights, our little comforts. This attachment causes us suffering and hinders us from being true soldiers of Christ. We must overcome these passions and attachments. Only then can we fight effectively.

Today, we see that the Church and faith are weak in many ways, and we seem to be losing ground. But a good soldier is not discouraged when the army is defeated. He continues to fight with all his strength, doing what he can until the very end. This is the attitude we must have as soldiers of Christ. Perhaps everything could change because of one faithful soldier. We must not give up, saying, "Oh, the bishops are weak," or "The world is going to hell anyway, so why bother?" No, we must fight to the end, doing all we can until the very last moment. The Lord will work miracles, and we will see them. Even if we do not save the entire world, our efforts will make a significant difference.

We can look back to the times of the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s. It was a period when a new world emerged—one that tolerated nothing of Christ. Yet, even in those dark times, faithful Christians bore witness to their faith and made a difference. Let us follow their example, remaining steadfast and courageous, no matter what comes.

But there were still some who remained—those who were not killed in the Red Terror and did not flee. They stayed and bore witness to their faith. For example, Saint Eugene wrote short stories about faith and gathered people to celebrate the liturgy in small apartments. Though he was a layperson, he invited priests to serve. Eventually, he was martyred in 1931. We, too, must be ready for such trials. We must be willing to die for Christ, no matter what kind of world emerges. If the Lord allows it to happen, so be it. We will not be frightened, run away, or become so depressed that we are paralyzed. The demons want us to tremble, to be overwhelmed with worries and information, to be nervous and shaken until they can break us. And when they break us, they build their own world, possessing the person and turning them into their instrument.

Let us be mindful of this. We know the plans and methods of the demons, of Satan, and with the Lord’s help and blessing, we will not allow this to happen to us. When our nest is destroyed, we will fly away, but we will remain free. Like the Israelites who left Egypt, they faced the desert and uncertainty, yet they went forward and celebrated. Now, they experienced joyful freedom in the Lord. This is what the Holy Spirit brings. The truth is simple, and it brings peace, calmness of heart, purity, and clear understanding and perception of what we must do and what the Lord expects of us.

May the Lord give us such a clean heart. He calls us to be like children—not in an infantile or naive way, but in our trust and simplicity. Do not worry excessively about the future. Approach everything with an open mind, but this does not mean believing everything you hear. Do not be constantly judgmental or negative. Avoid vainglory and pride. Instead, let us be like children, knowing that no matter what happens, no matter what the world goes through, we will be there, doing what the Lord blesses us to do at that time.

May the Lord help us, give us His strength, and keep us from all the evil in the world. Lord, bless us.
