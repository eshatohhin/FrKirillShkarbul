# Mystery of the Resurrection Can Make us Lord’s Witnesses

Dear brothers and sisters, we are now approaching the resurrection of Christ.  
We are in the Pascha of passions.  
The true source of our salvation comes from the passions of Christ, His death.  
He brings this victory through self-sacrifice.  
Very often, we focus on the resurrection, but the most important question is: How do we attain this resurrection?  
It is through the suffering of the Lord.  

One of the great saints, Saint Anastasia Hendrikova, said that the more sorrows and hardships we endure, the greater the reward and consolation we will receive from our Lord, which He is preparing for us.  
Therefore, it is so important that during these days of Holy Pascha, we remain with our Lord, even though almost all the disciples fled.  
Only a few remained: His mother, His beloved disciple John, Mary Magdalene, and a few other myrrh-bearing women. They stayed with Him until the end, by His cross.  
They buried Him and witnessed His death.  

In Acts 1:8, we read:  
*"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."*  
What does it mean to be His witness?  
It means to witness His death and resurrection.  
And we will receive great power from the Lord to testify to His death and resurrection.  

Since I have been to Jerusalem a few times, one occasion was especially moving.  
As the gates of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre were closing, many people who could not enter the church for the night stayed by the gates, expecting power from the Lord.  
They were anticipating the miracle, longing to partake in the miracle of the resurrection.  
Their faith was so alive. Some were able to stay inside the church all night, praying.  
This was not just on Pascha or a Sunday—it was an ordinary day.  
Yet, in the early morning, during the Divine Liturgy, the miracle unfolded, bringing us the great power of the resurrection.  
The people were waiting for this miracle to happen. They were not merely walking around.  

Many who visit Jerusalem come for tourism, to buy things, and they do not care.  
Even among those who stayed all night, many had false expectations—hoping for healings, career advancements, or solutions to family problems.  
But some, quite a number, were there to enter the Kingdom of God, to receive power from on high, and to become witnesses of the Lord's death and resurrection.  

In the Psalter, we read that the Lord will crush the bronze gates and break the iron bars.  
What are these iron bars or bronze gates?  
They are the gates of Hades that enslave us—enslaving all people through our passions, paralysis, blindness, hardness of heart, selfishness, fears, and materialistic thinking.  
The devil has enslaved us, causing us to think not of heaven, not of the truth of the Lord, not of the commandments of salvation and blessed life, but of accounts, mortgages, payments, credits, purchases, recipes, food, and everything except the Lord, His Kingdom, and His truth.  

What will we witness if we do not experience this and do not care about it?  
We will remain outside, distant.  
We must not deceive ourselves.  
If we do not love the Lord, if we are not seeking Him, if we do not put enough effort into our spiritual lives, we will be far from Him.

Our faith is shallow; it is faint and disappears like smoke at the slightest temptation or small issue.  
We falter and fall.  
How, then, will we be liberated from the gates of Hades, which even ensnared the prophets and righteous men of the Old Testament?  
How many who call themselves Christians—even Orthodox Christians—are now enslaved by the gates of propaganda and all kinds of false narratives?  
This happens because people do not place the miracle of the resurrection at the center of their hearts.  
This is why we cannot break the gates of Hades: because the resurrection is not alive in us, working in us, and bearing fruit.  

Our vessels are broken; they cannot hold the Holy Spirit.  
Instead, we fill them with all kinds of garbage poured into our heads and hearts through mass media, advertisements, social networks, friends, relatives, and everything around us.  
This is why we cannot live for Christ and be His witnesses to the ends of the earth.  
To be His witness, you must be ready to die for Him, to sacrifice everything, to give away all you have for His sake.  
Are you ready for that?  
To sacrifice your relatives, your family, your homeland, your way of life, your comfort—everything?  
This is the calling.  

It is impossible for man, but with God, all things are possible.  
He can make this possible for us if we are willing.  
We see how the prince of this world is trying to enslave us through various means—different ideologies, and now, digital methods.  
Like Herod in his day, who conducted a census, today they seek to count everything: your biometrics, your actions, your thoughts, your purchases—everything to be transparent.  
The spirit of the Antichrist is at work, but it cannot succeed if the Lord’s resurrection is alive in our hearts, bearing fruit, and making us His witnesses to the ends of the earth.  

Or let us begin closer to home—next door, within ourselves.  
Do we truly believe in the resurrection?  
In those days, not many believed He truly rose, and even now, most Jews reject it, calling it a lie.  
And when we ask Christians, we say, "Resurrection, Pascha, this, that," but it often feels like a fairy tale.  
We do not truly believe it; we do not even think about it.  
We do not open the Gospels to see what actually happened, to understand the witnesses.  
With what will we witness? With cake?  
Traditions are good and beautiful, but they are not the purpose for which the Lord suffered and rose again.  

Let us, therefore, penetrate the mystery of the resurrection.  
Let us ask for the Lord’s grace and wisdom to come upon us, to enlighten us, and to make our hearts meek—not stubborn and selfish, but humble and willing to follow His will.  
Perhaps then, we may truly become His witnesses and not lose this opportunity that the Lord is offering us in this short life.  

May the Lord’s grace, blessing, and peace be with every one of you.  
God bless.
