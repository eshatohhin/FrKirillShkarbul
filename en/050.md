# World will change. What to expect

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about what will happen in the future, as revealed to us in the Book of Revelation. This book, the most mystical and controversial, is also the final book of the New Testament and the entire Bible. It provides us with many clues about current events and what we can expect in the end times. When Christ was in Jerusalem, He spoke to His disciples about the things to come. His own end is deeply significant, not only for the fate of Jerusalem but also for the end of the world as we know it. This topic is especially relevant now, as we witness significant changes unfolding around us. People are once again discussing the New World Order, a concept that has been around since the 1930s. However, we are now approaching a new phase—a New World, a New World Order. Changes are indeed coming, though we cannot yet be certain of their exact nature. Opinions vary, but it is clear that economic and political shifts are already underway following the current global crisis. Just yesterday, the entire government of Burma (Myanmar) was arrested, and the military generals seized power. They have closed banks, restricted access to funds, and cut off power and internet services. News from the region is scarce, but this is what we know so far.

Such events could potentially occur in any country, regardless of where we are. Even in the United States, the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world, the situation is increasingly unstable. Significant changes are undoubtedly on the horizon—whether they manifest as wars, pandemics, or other crises. As Christians, we must be prepared for these challenges. We cannot afford to be caught off guard. We must brace ourselves for the worst in this world, though not in the spiritual realm. The Book of Revelation reminds us that the end of the world will come with the second coming of Jesus Christ, our Savior. His return is our hope and our ultimate desire. While this event belongs to the spiritual realm and our relationship with God, the mortal world will face dire circumstances. We are aware of the Antichrist, his kingdom, and the fact that many will worship him as God, rejecting the true God and Christ. Society will become immersed in a lifestyle and mindset that aligns with this new world order. As Christians, we know that these events will bring great challenges. We must be prepared for the spiritual and moral decline that will accompany these times.

It is crucial to remain psychologically ready. We should not deceive ourselves into thinking that the coronavirus pandemic will soon end, the economy will stabilize, or scientific advancements will lead to a better life. Such a mindset is not aligned with our worldview as Christians. Our hope lies not in the improvement of this world but in our eternal relationship with God and Christ, no matter how difficult things become. We must be strong enough to endure whatever comes our way. While we hope for the best, we must also prepare for the worst. This does not make us pessimists; it makes us Christian realists. We do not desire war or catastrophe, but we recognize that such events are likely to occur. There is nothing wrong with this perspective. It is a call to remain steadfast in our faith and ready for the trials that lie ahead.

Another temptation is to believe that in the future, everything will be stable—sustainable development, no turmoil, no economic crises. However, this mindset is also problematic. As Christians, we are not afraid of change. We understand that when significant changes occur—whether social, economic, or political—there will always be those who benefit. For instance, some businessmen thrive during such times, gaining profit while others suffer. But for us, as followers of Christ, our perspective is entirely different. When people suffer, we suffer alongside them. Yet, we can derive profound spiritual benefits from such suffering and adversity. This is a crucial lesson we must learn: no matter how dire the circumstances, we can emerge stronger, wiser, and more spiritually grounded as Christians and as a church. Therefore, we should not fear any form of temptation, change, or challenge. Instead, let us adopt this mindset of resilience and faith.

What we are witnessing now is a subtle form of evil in the world. While there is no widespread, open aggression against Christianity—except in certain regions like parts of Africa or Muslim-majority countries—persecution still exists globally. This is not because evil has diminished or because faith has grown stronger. In fact, faith is weakening among many. The reason for this is that evil is masquerading as something good, attempting to lure as many people as possible into its trap. It is like falling into a snare: what appears good at first ultimately ensnares and overwhelms. This is precisely what is happening today. The world encourages people to become dependent on gadgets, social media platforms like Facebook, material possessions, and comfortable lifestyles. It promotes the idea that we must have everything—education for our children, financial security, and endless conveniences—so that when the time comes to make a choice, people will be unable to say, "No, we can live without this." As a result, everyone becomes entangled in a system devoid of God, a system that offers a counterfeit version of divinity.

A similar scenario unfolded in the Soviet Union. Once a predominantly Christian society, it suddenly turned against the church. People abandoned their faith, and hostility toward Christianity became widespread. Those who held onto their faith in Christ faced persecution, marginalization, and immense suffering. Surviving in such a society became nearly impossible. This is what we must prepare for. While we currently enjoy relative freedom, we must use this time to strengthen our faith and prepare ourselves spiritually. We must be ready to face a world that may one day reject God entirely, a world where holding onto our faith could mean enduring great trials. Let us prepare now, while we still can, so that we may stand firm in the face of whatever challenges lie ahead.

And if that day comes—and it will come eventually—when everyone turns against Christ, rejecting Him entirely or embracing a counterfeit version of Him, those who remain faithful to Jesus Christ and walk the path of salvation will face destruction or marginalization. There will be so few true believers left that they will no longer be seen as a threat. Even now, the church does not face widespread aggression because its influence has diminished, making it less of a concern for the emerging new world order. Let us, therefore, use this time to prepare ourselves. Through fasting, enduring trials, engaging in active mission work, and deepening our faith through education, we can grow stronger as soldiers of Christ. We must strive to be among the few who can preserve our faith during times of persecution and challenge.

Let us become less dependent on this world. No matter what happens—whether it’s a new government, war, revolution, or any other upheaval—we must remain steadfast in Christ. We should not fear these events but instead be ready to stand firm in our faith. What is happening now bears a striking resemblance to the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem. At first, the crowds cheered, proclaiming Him as the Savior, but soon after, one of His apostles betrayed Him. He was arrested, persecuted, and killed, while His disciples fled in fear. This transformation happened almost overnight. Similarly, we must be prepared for a sudden shift in attitudes toward Christianity. Today, people may praise the church and speak favorably of Christianity, but this could change abruptly. Many may abandon their faith, betray Christ like Judas, or flee in fear. Those who remain loyal to Christ will face severe persecution, and their numbers will be few.

Let us perceive the present through this lens. What matters most is not the crises, vaccinations, or political changes of this year or the next. These things are secondary. Instead, let us focus on strengthening our faith, remaining loyal to Christ, and deepening our commitment through prayer, fasting, and love for Christ and others. Let us be ready to stand firm, no matter what comes. God bless.
