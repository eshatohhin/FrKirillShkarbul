# How to strengthen spiritual authority of the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about the spiritual authority that the Church often lacks and what the true source of this authority is. If the Church had this authority, the whole world would listen to its testimony, and there would not be so many scandals or so many people turning away from the Church. Very often, we mistakenly identify the wrong things as the source of authority, and this is a significant problem. In modern times, this issue is particularly pressing because we are living in very difficult and decisive times. 

Within the Orthodox Church, we are currently facing internal quarrels and even the possibility of splits. In the world at large, we are experiencing what is being called the "Great Reset," a period of great uncertainty as the world undergoes a profound transformation. We do not know what the future holds—it may be bad, or it may be good, but it is very uncertain at this moment. The state of society today is not very optimistic. Traditional moral values have been eroded, family values have been destroyed, and we are living in a postmodernist mindset where cultural heritage is no longer preserved. Almost everything has been lost, reduced to mere artifacts of history. As a result, humanity as a whole, and the Church as a whole, are not in good shape.

We are at a crossroads, and we are witnessing a rise in religious syncretism. Everything seems to be blending together, with different sects and cults emerging from all directions—shamanism, yoga, and so on. The true faith is very weak right now. In these times of temptation and crisis, we need to understand what the true factors are that can strengthen our testimony about Christ. Too often, people have mistaken the wrong things as the source of authority. Today, I want to discuss five things that are often wrongly considered sources of authority, and then I will talk about what the true source of authority is.

The first thing that some people advocate as a source of authority is a glorious history. They point to the Church's rich background, such as the history of the Church in Rome, where many saints lived and where the apostles preached. This historical glory, they argue, gives the Church its authority. However, we have seen that this is not enough. The Roman Church eventually drifted away from the true faith, and many churches that once thrived have been destroyed. For example, in Asia Minor, which is now modern-day Turkey, there were once many glorious churches, but today they are almost all gone. The Church of Carthage is also gone. We cannot rely on history alone. Even in Constantinople, there were great bishops like John Chrysostom, but people today do not seem to care much about this history. 

This shows that a glorious past is not enough to sustain the Church's authority in the present. We must look deeper to find the true source of spiritual authority.

And we see that relying on a glorious history does not work. It does not withstand the test of time. Another mistaken source of authority is an appeal to legalistic arguments. For example, some claim that by the law of the Church, the Vatican is now the center of authority. Similarly, many Orthodox people argue that their authority comes from apostolic succession—the laying on of hands, which they believe transmits the grace of the apostles. They say, "We are the chairs of the apostles, the bishops, and this is the source of our authority." However, this argument is weak because we know that many bishops, patriarchs, and even popes have fallen into heresy or become great sinners. As holy people have said, "Hell is full of bishops." The laying on of hands did not save them. 

Of course, I am not denying that grace comes from the apostles, but this alone does not guarantee anything. Entire churches have fallen into heresy, even though all their bishops were ordained by canonical bishops. This shows that apostolic succession is an external, legalistic matter. It is valid to a certain extent, but it is not a strong foundation for true spiritual authority. 

Another wrong source of authority is the appeal to national spirit. Some claim that the Church's authority comes from the glorious history of their nation—whether Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Greek, or Georgian. They argue that their nation's strength and history make their Church superior. However, this is also a weak argument. People are seeking truth that comes from Christ, who transcends all nations. While it is not bad to have a strong nation with many Christians and saints who glorified God, this is not the main factor. Entire nations have turned atheist or abandoned their faith, so we cannot rely on national identity as a source of authority. 

This is a significant problem for Orthodox churches, as they often become segregated along national lines. Different nations have different local churches, and this weakens our collective testimony about Christ. 

The fourth mistaken source of authority is any kind of declaration or slogan. For example, some say, "Moscow is the third Rome," claiming that this powerful idea gives them authority. However, this is not persuasive because true authority does not come from slogans or branding. The Church is not like McDonald's, where you can say, "This is a quality brand, so you must accept it." The Church does not rely on such things. Slogans and declarations are not sources of true spiritual authority. 

The fifth and final mistaken source of authority is the abundance of churches, icons, gold, ancient relics, and holy objects. Some argue that the Church's authority is evident in its beautiful buildings, relics of saints, and even parts of the cross of Christ. While these things can inspire faith and draw people's attention, they are not convincing on their own. Holy objects can motivate people and strengthen their faith, and they can be useful for mission work by catching people's attention. However, at some point, people need to see beyond the external beauty. They need to see that the Church is not just about nice singing, beautiful icons, or interesting relics. Behind all these things is God Himself, holiness, and the call to live a holy life as part of the body of Christ. Without this deeper understanding, people may be interested for a while, but their interest will fade. 

In conclusion, none of these five things—glorious history, legalistic arguments, national spirit, declarations, or external beauty—are the true source of spiritual authority. They may have some value, but they are not enough to sustain the Church's authority in the world. We must look deeper to find the true source of authority, which I will discuss next.

Indeed, most people are quite superficial and do not truly grasp what lies beneath the surface. This is why relying on external or superficial sources of authority does not work. As we have seen, the five things I listed earlier—glorious history, legalistic arguments, national spirit, declarations, and external beauty—are not the true sources of authority. While they may have some validity and are not entirely without value, they are not the most crucial or foundational. 

So, what is truly important? Let us now discuss the real sources of spiritual authority. 

The first is **purity of faith**. The faith must be one hundred percent authentic, without any subjective additions or alterations. In today's world, there are many sects, each with its own interpretation of the Bible. If everyone has a different interpretation, why should anyone believe one over another? This is not persuasive. What is needed is an authentic, true faith that comes directly from the apostles, unchanged and unaltered. This is the foundation of true spiritual authority. 

The second, and perhaps even more important, is **holiness of life**. This means that people must truly follow Christ in how they live, in how they treat others, and in the love they show. Holiness of life is cultivated through two main practices: **asceticism** and **prayer**. Asceticism involves denying the old, selfish self and allowing Christ to grow within us. Prayer strengthens our faith, as we ask God for help and engage in a dialogue with Him. These practices are essential. 

If our leaders—patriarchs, bishops, or others—live in luxury, with big cars and grand palaces, how can they credibly call others to help the poor, reject worldly attachments, and live selflessly? They have no moral authority to speak such words if they themselves are immersed in wealth and comfort. Holiness of life is therefore a critical source of true spiritual authority. 

The third source is **sacrifice for Christ**. In the early Church, confessors and martyrs held great authority because they had sacrificed everything for their faith. Confessors were those who endured torture but remained faithful to Christ, and people would seek their advice because they had proven their devotion through immense suffering. Today, we may not face the same level of persecution, but we can still sacrifice for Christ—whether by giving our time to minister to the poor, leaving our families and countries to serve God, or making other significant sacrifices for the sake of the Gospel. Such sacrifices bring spiritual authority. 

The fourth source is **active ministry to Christ**. What are we doing to serve Christ? This could involve social work, mission work, or other forms of active engagement in tasks done in His name. In some Orthodox communities, people may pray diligently and attend services regularly but do little else. This can weaken our testimony. Other groups, such as Buddhists or other sects, often engage in significant charitable work—building hospitals, running orphanages, and more. If we fail to do such things, our message loses credibility. We must strike a balance between prayer and active ministry. 

The fifth and final source is a **living word**. Our testimony about faith must include a living, dynamic proclamation of truth. We cannot rely solely on textbooks, bureaucratic language, or politically correct speech that caters to the spirit of this world. Instead, we must speak boldly and fearlessly, unafraid to declare the truth. A living word is one that dares to challenge, inspire, and transform, rooted in the power of the Gospel. 

In summary, the true sources of spiritual authority are:  
1. **Purity of faith**—an authentic, unaltered faith passed down from the apostles.  
2. **Holiness of life**—living in a way that reflects Christ through asceticism, prayer, and love.  
3. **Sacrifice for Christ**—being willing to give up comfort, time, or even safety for the sake of the Gospel.  
4. **Active ministry**—engaging in works of service and mission that demonstrate our faith in action.  
5. **A living word**—boldly proclaiming the truth without fear or compromise.  

These are the foundations of true spiritual authority, and they are what the Church must prioritize if it is to regain its strength and credibility in these challenging times.

And we must be willing to share and live out this testimony. Let us remember these five essential sources of spiritual authority, as we often fall short in these areas. We must recognize their importance and strive to embody them in the Church. 

Sometimes, there is a temptation to adopt a passive attitude, saying, "It is all in the Lord's providence. If people do not come to the Church, it is because the Lord has not brought them." While it is true that God is sovereign, we must also understand that His providence works through our active participation. If we are not active, if we do not care about these five things—purity of faith, holiness of life, sacrifice for Christ, active ministry, and a living word—then we cannot expect the Church to grow or thrive. 

Let us be eager and passionate in our faith, not waiting passively for something to happen. Let us be alive in Christ, bearing fruit through our actions and our witness. We must change ourselves and actively engage in this testimony. Only then will people be drawn to the Church. Many are walking around, looking at the Church from the outside, but they do not see what they need to see. They do not see the transformative power of Christ because we are not living it out fully. 

Let us remember what is truly important and what Christ expects from each of us. May the Lord help you, bless you, and grant you His wisdom and obedience to His will. May He guide you away from selfishness and lead you on the path of Christian testimony. 

God bless you all.
