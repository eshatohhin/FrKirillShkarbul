# Polynesia mission fruits and prospects

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share with you my overall feelings about the mission in Polynesia.  
Now that this mission trip is over, I hope it is just the first trip in preparation for future missions.  
It is difficult to expect significant results from just one visit.  
The worst outcome we can encounter is when there is no interest in the mission or the church—when nobody seems to want anything.  
I have been to some places before where there was nothing—no results at all. You do a lot of mission work, but there are no visible outcomes.  
Well, at least no evident results. Perhaps after 20 years, there might be some fruits, but they are not evident now.  
In such cases, you don’t really feel like going back.  
On the other hand, there are some missions where you encounter thousands, or even hundreds, of people.  
All of them are eager to become Orthodox Christians, and you feel incredibly encouraged. You want to do more and return to develop the mission further.  

Polynesia falls somewhere in the middle.  
We have already seen some fruits from this first trip, which give me motivation for the future development of this mission.  
Before sharing more about these fruits, I want to say a few words about Polynesia as a whole—French Polynesia and the mission in this region.  

This is the largest part of the Pacific. The Pacific is divided into Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia.  
Polynesia is the largest portion, with over 1,000 decent-sized islands—not counting the tiny micro-islands. It includes six countries and nine territories.  
Some of these territories are part of other countries, such as Hawaii, American Samoa, and Easter Island.  
In total, there are 15 entities—not all of them independent countries. For example, French Polynesia is part of France, but when you visit, it feels like its own country.  

Out of these 15, some already have an Orthodox presence, such as New Zealand, Hawaii, Vanuatu, and Fiji.  
However, most of these places have no Orthodox presence yet. This is one of the most challenging regions in the world to reach.  
It is far away from places with a strong church presence, and the islands themselves are far apart.  
Not many people are willing to go there to preach or live. It is a different world.  

If we want to fulfill the mission the Lord has given us, we must consider Polynesia—Oceania, and specifically French Polynesia.  
We cannot do everything everywhere at the same time. Our mission resources, people, and time are limited.  
We need to focus on something, and I believe French Polynesia is a good place to start.  

French Polynesia consists of 121 islands, of which 75 are inhabited.  
If we are to preach there, we need to reach at least these 75 islands.  
This time, I visited four of these islands and gained an impression of the different types of islands.  
There is Tahiti, the largest, as well as mid-sized islands—some more developed, others less so—and smaller, more remote islands.  

If you decide to go to a place like French Polynesia to preach, you need to love the place and be ready for the challenge.  
It is a significant challenge. French Polynesia is spread over an area the size of Europe—from Spain to Denmark.  
It is vast, with no buses, railroads, or trains.  
You can travel by ship, which is tough due to storms and rough seas, or by plane, which is expensive and not always available.  
Not all islands have airports, so reaching some places is particularly difficult.  

You need to be ready for the challenge, but you also need to love the place.  
To me, it is like the stars spread across the heavens—magnificent and mysterious.

They are separate from one another, much like the stars. Each island is its own small universe.  
Most of the people who live there may travel elsewhere only once or twice in their lifetime. They do not travel often.  
It is like a small village, with perhaps a few hundred or two thousand people.  
That’s it. It is a tiny, isolated village with little connection to the outside world.  
The only way to reach it is by plane, which feels like traveling to a different world.  
This is not like a regular village in the countryside, where people travel often and have frequent visitors.  
These islands are their own little universes. Each one is a small world unto itself.  

To do mission work here, you need to be willing to meet people, talk to them, and testify to the Lord’s love.  
You need to love these people and be ready for difficult conditions—lack of amenities, no internet, perhaps no hot water, mosquitoes, and all that comes with such a life.  
We need missionaries who are prepared for this kind of challenge. They may not see their families for years.  
They will live on these secluded, faraway islands, doing mission work, sometimes without financial support, with no one to rely on but God.  
This is a very challenging project.  

But why do I say I have hope, and why do I believe we have already seen some fruits, even from this first trip?  
This became clear during the first mission walk I undertook on the small island of Dubuay.  
In my previous videos, I mentioned that Tahiti is a very difficult place for mission work and development.  
However, on the smaller islands, many people are eager to talk, learn more, and are open to embracing the faith.  

On that first trip, I met a man named Raya Vera. He is a descendant—a great-grandson—of King Tamatua, a king who ruled some of these islands in the past.  
From history, we know that King Tamatua was very influential and had many descendants.  
Most of the 2,000 people living on Dubuay are descendants of Tamatua.  
While this may not seem particularly special, it is interesting.  

Raya told me about this king and took me to the grave of what I believe was the son of the king’s princess. He shared the island’s history with me.  
We had a conversation lasting two to three hours, during which he told me about the ship *Bounty*, which arrived on the island in 1789.  
This English ship initiated communication, trade, and development. He also spoke about the first Protestant missionaries who came to the island.  
Raya has a book about one of these missionaries, whose last name was Williams.  
He believes he might be related to this missionary, as his own last name, Williams, was changed to Viriyamu.  

Raya also had a Bible—a rare sight in Polynesia. It was a Bible in the Tahitian language.  
This showed me the fruits of past missionary work. Raya and his family are among those who embraced the faith brought by Protestant missionaries 200 years ago.  
However, their faith is mixed with their own cultural beliefs—paganism, shamanism, and animism.  
There is much work to be done to share the true faith, the true worship of Christ, and the true Church.  

Raya himself is not yet ready to become Orthodox, but he is eager to help us.  
He has a very positive feeling about our mission and is motivated not by money or personal gain but by a genuine desire to assist.  
He took me around the island, showing me its history and culture.

We went on a bicycle trip around the island. While it would normally take about three hours to ride around, it took us an entire day because we stopped frequently.  
Raya introduced me to his relatives and friends, and we had many conversations with them.  
He acted as a bridge between me and the locals, as most people there do not speak English.  
Raya, who is now 62, studied and lived in Florida, USA, for about 25 years. He is energetic, slim, and very active—quite different from the majority of the people on the island, who tend to be slower, larger, and more introverted.  
Many are also suspicious of foreigners. They primarily speak French and Tahitian, not English.  
Raya helped me establish connections with the people there.  

Some of the people we met showed interest in the mission. I even encountered Mormons and members of other sects on the street, and we had meaningful conversations.  
There were individuals who expressed a willingness to become Orthodox, but it will take more time, more dialogue, and the presence of a missionary for at least a few months or even a year.  
Like the Apostle Paul, who stayed in places like Tarsus and Corinth for months or years to establish churches, the same approach is needed here.  
A missionary must come, stay, and establish a local church—perhaps even a family church—before moving on to another location.  

Having someone like Raya to guide, introduce, and translate is invaluable.  
What’s more, Raya mentioned that he has relatives on many other islands, such as the Marquesas, Rapa, and Rurutu.  
This gave me an idea: why not travel together to these islands where he knows people and introduce the faith to them?  
When I shared this idea with Raya, he became very excited and said he was willing to help.  

However, organizing such a trip will not be easy. It will require significant financial support, careful planning, and time.  
We will need to decide where to go, print materials like the Gospel in the Tahitian language, and distribute them as gifts to those interested in learning about Christ.  
Most people there do not have a Bible in their homes, even though many consider themselves Christians or belong to sects like Adventists or Jehovah’s Witnesses.  
We would also need a prayer book in Tahitian to help introduce the faith more effectively.  

Let us pray for this mission. Let us pray that the Lord sends more people—more missionaries—who are willing to go to the ends of the earth to bring the true faith, to testify to His love, His salvation, and the kingdom of heaven.  
Let us pray that these people may come to know true life in Christ and with Christ.  
May the Lord bless this mission, help it grow, and strengthen it.  

May the Lord be with us, bless each of you, and protect us from all evil and temptation.  
God bless you all, and thank you to everyone who supports the mission, prays for it, and watches our videos.  
God bless.
