# What is the “narrow path” that leads to Life

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about a very important topic: the path that can lead us to salvation. Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said that the path to salvation is narrow, and very few follow Him and walk this path. But the path to destruction, to perdition, is broad, very wide, and many are those who walk this path. What is this path? Are we walking it? Have we begun walking this path? The Lord also said that the gates to the kingdom of heaven are narrow, and many will try to squeeze through those gates but will not be able to do so. They will be left outside, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. It will be too late, and nothing can be done. These words are very tough and not easy to hear. So let us think about them now, because it is better to reflect on them now than later when we find ourselves in that situation. Even though those people will say, "Lord, Lord, we believe in You, and we did many things in Your name—casting out demons and performing miracles," He will say, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers." So they will not be with Him. These are very alarming words, and we need to think about them deeply.

Today, let us consider three comparisons—parables, if you will—that can help us better understand what this path is like and how to begin walking it. First, when we love someone—our spouse, children, or loved ones—we think about them all the time. They are in our hearts. We message them, we call them. If we don’t see or talk to them for a long time, we feel lonely, our mood worsens, and we lose interest in other things. Do we feel the same way toward God, toward Christ? Are we longing for Him? Let us be honest with ourselves: we are not. We are not seeking Him. We do not truly care. On Sundays, yes, we go to church, we pray, we wear a cross, and we think that is enough. But it is not. This is not enough.

Because if we do not love Him, we do not even keep the first commandment, which is found in the Old Testament. How can we claim to follow the New Testament if we fail to uphold the Old? In the Old Testament, the primary commandment—which remains valid today—is this: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself." We are the new Israel, the Church, and this commandment applies to us. Do we love God in this way? Do we pour all the energy of our hearts into loving Him, seeking Him, pursuing His truth, and striving to please Him in every way? The truth is, we do not. We do not live like this, and this is a significant problem. 

You might ask, "If I love God in this way, does that mean I neglect my other relationships?" No. If we love God as we should, we will love others in a healthy, selfless way—not as possessions or objects to control, but with genuine love. Loving God and loving others are two sides of the same coin. Without loving God, we cannot truly love people as we ought. This is crucial. We must acknowledge this as a problem: "I do not love God." Let us be honest with ourselves. We need to recognize this and put more effort into awakening our hearts, seeking Him, and pursuing Him. When we do, He will see our efforts and grant us the gift of true faith, empowering us to follow Him wholeheartedly.

The second comparison we must consider is this: we have many goals in life—earning money, buying a house, raising a family, advancing in our careers, pursuing hobbies, maintaining health and fitness, and so on. Where does God fit into these priorities? Is He a priority? Is He *the* priority? If we are honest, we will realize He is not. If He were, we would wake up every day thinking about Him, asking, "What can I do for Him today? How can I follow Jesus Christ? He is my goal; I want to be with Him every day, not just after I die." But we do not have this mindset. For many of us, God is not first; He might be 23rd on our list of priorities. This must change. If we want true life, if we want to draw life from Him, He must become our first and foremost priority. 

Even clergy can fall into this trap. Building a church, managing projects, or pursuing personal ambitions can sometimes take precedence over being with Christ. This is not just a problem for laypeople; it is a challenge for everyone. You might ask, "If God becomes my priority, do I have to become a monk or a nun? Do I have to give up everything else?" No. God does not want us to be mindless followers or slaves in the negative sense. He created us to be creators, just as He is the Creator. He has given us the freedom to create, to build relationships, to pursue projects, and to live fully. Even sweeping the floors can be an act of creativity if done with love and purpose. We do not have to be Michelangelo to honor God. Following Him does not mean abandoning all hobbies, interests, or responsibilities. It means aligning everything we do with His will, making Him the center of our lives. 

Let us reflect on these truths and strive to reorder our priorities, placing God at the center of all we do. Only then can we truly walk the narrow path that leads to salvation.

We can be very active and deeply involved in many different aspects of life—our jobs, hobbies, relationships, and responsibilities. However, all of these must be subject to Christ. When Christ is at the center, we begin to see Him in everything we do. This is when our actions gain their true value, and they no longer become idols that push God out of our hearts. Idols are anything that takes the place of God in our lives—things that fill our hearts so completely that they squeeze Him out. We may not worship these idols in the traditional sense, but they dominate our thoughts, time, and energy. Let us crush these idols and place God on the altar of our hearts. When we do this, everything else we do will make sense and bring us true joy.

The final parable I want to share is about what it means to follow Christ. Where is this path, and how do we stay on it? Imagine you want to become a champion in a sport, like tennis or soccer. To achieve this, you must train every day, follow a strict schedule, and remain focused on your goal. The same applies to a career, academics, or any other pursuit. If you stop training or studying for two years, it becomes much harder to return to that level of excellence. You might even lose the opportunity altogether. Yet, when it comes to our relationship with God, we often think, "God will always be there. I can come back to Him whenever I want." But it doesn’t work like that. If we break our covenant with Him, stop receiving Holy Communion, neglect prayer, and live a lifestyle that ignores Him, it becomes very difficult to restore that relationship. It may even be a different relationship altogether.

Consider this: if you are in an army at war and decide to take a break for a few days, you risk losing the battle and your country. Similarly, when we follow Christ, it introduces a new dimension to our lives—a spiritual dimension that must become the main focus. Everything else must be subject to this. We cannot simply set it aside and expect to pick it up later without consequences.

A better analogy might be building a relationship with someone you love. If you want to marry someone, there is a process of dating, giving gifts, staying in touch, and nurturing the relationship. You cannot say, "I’m too busy for the next six months," and expect the relationship to remain intact. Often, when people say, "I’m too busy to go to church," it’s like saying to a loved one, "I’m too busy to talk to you for months." By the time you return, the relationship may be irreparably damaged. The same is true with God. We cannot wait until we are old to start praying, reading the Bible, and seeking Him. We must begin now, every day, making our relationship with Christ the main goal of our lives.

Just as there is a strategy to win a war or advance in a career, there is a spiritual "algorithm" for walking the path of salvation. This path may look different for each person, but it is there, and it is the path the Lord wants us to follow. We must seek it, find it, and walk it faithfully. Let us commit to this journey today, making Christ the center of our lives and following Him step by step, every day.

No matter how difficult or painful the path may be, we must walk it. This path is narrow, but it is the source of life and love. If we turn away from it, we become spiritually dead again. This is why we see so much chaos in the world—wars, poor decisions, addiction, and lives spiraling out of control. People make these mistakes because they do not have God before them. Instead, they fill their lives with other things, and this is not just a problem for "other people." It is our problem too. When we prioritize anything over God, we are spiritually dead, even if we appear active, successful, or intelligent. 

Christ’s words are harsh but true: "Let the dead bury their own dead." If we are not drawing life from Him, if He is not the goal of our lives and the One we love above all else, we are spiritually dead. Let us seek, crave, and pursue this relationship with God. Let us develop it every day, making Him the center of our lives. May God help and bless you on this path, guiding you to discover it and walk it faithfully each day. Amen.
