# How to treat Politics

Dear friends, it is increasingly common for Christians to dislike one another due to political differences. However, Christ said that people will know you are His disciples if you have love for one another. This is what we must remember: if we dislike someone because of their political stance, we are not yet true disciples of Christ. We are called to love even our enemies. This brings us to a practical question: What is my relationship to politics? There are two common mistakes in this regard.

The first mistake is excessive involvement in politics. When people prioritize politics above all else, it becomes more important than prayer, serving Christ, or the commandment to love our enemies. This is a significant problem, especially when it affects a church or group of Christians, causing them to become entangled in a political agenda. In such cases, we might say that "the salt has lost its saltiness." This is a serious issue.

The second mistake is complete disengagement from politics. Some say, "I believe in God and care nothing for politics. I am above all that; it has no importance to me." While this attitude is better than the first, it still has its shortcomings. Certain aspects of earthly life, such as choosing a school for your children or deciding what to eat for breakfast, are not explicitly addressed in the Bible. Yet, we recognize their practical importance. Taking the wrong bus or eating unhealthy food could lead to problems, but these concerns pale in comparison to our pursuit of faith in Christ. What we say to God in prayer is far more important than what we eat for breakfast. Therefore, we must set our priorities in the right order. When we do, everything else will fall into place.

For us, the foremost priority is seeking the kingdom of heaven and the truth of God. This should fill our hearts and minds completely. If we truly love someone, we think about them constantly. This is the devotion we must have toward God and Christ. While other matters are not entirely unimportant, they are far less significant. Just as someone in love might forget to brush their teeth while rushing to buy flowers, the apostles, during their missions, sometimes did not even have time to eat. Similarly, political issues should be approached with the mindset of Christ's words: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." When asked whether Jews should pay taxes to the Romans, Christ emphasized the distinction between earthly and divine matters.

What does this mean for us? It means we are not striving to establish a government that will bring the kingdom of heaven to earth—this will never happen. However, we can engage in political discussions or agendas to some extent because we care about our country. While most of us cannot effect massive political change, we can still contribute in meaningful ways. If the government acts unjustly, we can voice our criticism, but we must do so without passion, hatred, or constant blame. Our involvement should be measured and guided by love, not division.

First of all, we must recognize that we are to blame ourselves and remain humble. We need to stay in a state of repentance, acknowledging our own sins. Only when we humble ourselves will the Lord guide us in what we should say or do regarding politics. Currently, the world is entering a period of great instability—politically, economically, and in many other ways. We are witnessing significant changes in political systems and structures across many countries. We must prepare now for what may come sooner rather than later. To prepare, we must learn to hear the voice of God within us. When the time of temptation and darkness arrives—a time marked by conflict and strife—we, as Christians, must not listen to our own desires or the noise in our minds. Instead, we must be able to hear Christ’s voice clearly.

At that time, Christ may speak different things to different people. To some, He may say, "Pray from morning till night, every day and through the night. Pray for the nation, that the people may not perish. Pray for good." To others, He may call them to participate in what is happening, but with His blessing. They will be preserved and protected by God as they act, and they will bear witness in the right way—a Christian testimony. This will also be a time of great opportunity for true Christians to demonstrate their love for Christ. In times of darkness, when people are angry and fighting, those who are driven by Christian love—love for enemies, compassion for others, and care even for political adversaries—will shine brightly. Their light will stand out in the surrounding darkness, bringing the true message of Christ’s love to those in need.

Even those you consider political rivals—those you fear will bring chaos if they gain power—may, upon encountering your love and compassion, come to believe in Christ. They may follow Him and use their influence to lead others toward God. You never know how the Lord will arrange things. What we must do is remain calm, stay close to Christ, and keep His kingdom in our hearts. We must be His servants and instruments, not tools of the devil through passions or deceit. In these times, we must serve Christ our Lord, and this will lead us to ministry and bring Him glory.

The problem with any government, country, or nation is that it seeks to glorify itself. "We are the best party, the best country, the best nation." But for Christians, this is not the case. When the martyrs were asked, "What is your name?" they replied, "I am a Christian." When asked, "What is your nation?" they said, "My nation is Christian." And when questioned, "Who is your master, your ruler, your political leader?" they answered, "My leader is Jesus Christ." This is what matters most for true Christians. Not, "I am of this nation, a citizen of this country, a socialist, a capitalist, or a monarchist." All of that is secondary. Our primary identity is in Christ, and our ultimate allegiance is to Him.

We are, first and foremost, Christians. This identity is everything to us. Let us not merely hold this as an idea but truly feel it and live it. If we do so, the darkness will not overcome the church, and Christ will be with us until the end of time. He will give us strength and the right words to bear witness in a world shrouded in darkness. May the Lord help each of you, bless you, grant you wisdom, and provide health for you and your families. God bless.
