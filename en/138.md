# How can God save the world and the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, when we try to live a spiritual life, we often ask ourselves, "Is there any use in prayer?", "Does the Lord hear me?", "Does my prayer change anything in my life, or even in the life of the whole world, of the whole Church? Is there any use in it?"  
And very often, we suspect that it's not worth it. God doesn't seem to respond to us. And now, when we face crises—economic crises, sickness, or the ongoing war—we find ourselves questioning even more. Many people are talking about the end of the world, Armageddon, and the apocalypse.  

This situation is awakening those who are asleep. It’s like in our own lives: when everything goes well, we don’t feel the need to go to church or pray. But when something shocking happens—a crisis, a tragedy—we turn to God, we pray, we ask for His help, and then, once the storm passes, we forget again.  

Now, we are going through such a time. It may seem to us that darkness is overcoming. We see division in the Church, restrictions on mission work, and uncertainty about the future with wars and the so-called "global reset" agenda. It feels as though electronic slavery is approaching, and it may even seem like the end of the world is near.  

But if we look back into history, we will discover that similar things have happened in the past. Today, I want to talk about how the Church has navigated through such times and how we can draw useful lessons from those experiences. We are dealing with both spiritual and material realities. What is the relationship between them? How does my spiritual life influence my daily life?  

There is a temptation that comes from everywhere: if you don’t have a good job, if you don’t have money, if you don’t have connections, you’re done. You’re finished. So, care about those things first. As for prayer, God is always there. He has been waiting for you for thousands of years. It’s not going to change anything in the physical world. If you pray or go on a pilgrimage, it won’t change your material circumstances.  

In the same way, the prayers of the Church cannot directly influence political decisions. They cannot stop wars or prevent people from dying. Some might say, "We need to take action—write in newspapers, engage in the information war. That can make a difference. But prayer? How can it bring any change?"  

Let us go back to the 7th and 8th centuries. At that time, it was also a period of crisis. We often romanticize the past, thinking that everything was peaceful—countryside, peasants, the Middle Ages, everything stable and serene. Families were strong, currency was stable, gold and silver were reliable. It’s only in modern times, we think, that everything is chaotic—technology, financial markets, constant change, and crisis.  

But in reality, those times were also marked by great struggles, both spiritual and physical. When we look at the teachings of Saint John Chrysostom in the 4th century, he spoke about the spiritual warfare that was ongoing. Even earlier, in Old Testament times, we see the people of Israel being conquered repeatedly and falling into paganism. There was always a sense of being on the verge of being overtaken by evil.  

The Church of the Old Testament was small, with only a few prophets standing firm with the Lord, while the majority worshiped Baal and other idols. They faced immense challenges, and there was always a feeling among the faithful that the end of the world was near, that darkness was almost overcoming, and that they were fighting against it.  

Yet, through it all, the Church endured. The prayers of the faithful, though seemingly powerless in the face of overwhelming odds, sustained them. They remind us that our spiritual life is not separate from our daily struggles but deeply connected to them. Prayer may not change the external circumstances immediately, but it transforms us, strengthens us, and aligns us with God’s will.  

So, let us not lose heart. Let us learn from the past and trust that, even in the darkest times, our prayers matter. They may not stop wars or solve economic crises, but they draw us closer to God, who is our ultimate hope and refuge.

When we neglect prayer, we lose our vigilance. The Lord said, "Be on guard, be vigilant." When we are not vigilant, we fall into complacency, thinking that everything remains the same—just politics changing, while our little world stays intact. We live in our small bubble, content with our daily routines: eating our sausage, drinking our coffee, and going about our lives. We don’t feel the larger struggles of the world.  

But now, with wars, fires, and other crises, these events are there to wake us up. They remind us that our spiritual vigilance is essential.  

Going back to the 6th and 7th centuries, the Church faced two major dangers. The first danger came from external forces: the Muslims and the Persians. St. John of Damascus referred to Islam as the "forerunner of the Antichrist." At that time, they conquered half of the Byzantine Empire, posing not only a political but also an ideological threat to the Christian world.  

The second danger came from within. The Byzantine Empire, which was supposed to support the Church, fell into heresy. For over a century, three emperors in a row promoted the policy of destroying icons, a heresy known as iconoclasm. The true Church was suppressed, and the faith was under attack.  

During this time, the real Church was reduced to just a few faithful individuals—primarily monks who held fast to the Orthodox Christian faith. The rest of the world seemed to be slipping away into heresy and paganism. Many of these faithful monks were martyred, imprisoned, or killed by the very emperors and systems that claimed to be Christian.  

To those living through that time, it seemed like the end of the world. Darkness appeared to be overcoming everything. Yet, the Church survived. The testimony of Christ continued, and the faith endured to this day.  

How did this happen? When darkness seemed to be closing in from all sides—with the rise of Islam, the spread of iconoclasm, and even the Latin world slipping into errors—salvation came through the monks. Not all monks, but a few who were spiritually united with the Lord. They became the pillars of truth, and through them, the Lord worked.  

These monks, fully faithful to Christ, preserved the truth. Their prayers and steadfastness led to the eventual overthrow of iconoclasm. The Byzantine Empire regained strength, pushed back the Muslim forces for a time, and even carried out missions within Muslim territories. Saints emerged, and the Church was revitalized.  

This revival was largely due to the strengthening of prayer and the monastic spirit. Among these monks were the Studites, from the Studion Monastery, who followed a tradition known as the "sleepless ones" (in Greek, *Akoimetoi*). They maintained continuous prayer, 24 hours a day. The divine liturgy and services were held in eight-hour intervals, with groups of priests and monks taking turns to ensure that prayer never ceased.  

In addition to the liturgy, they read the Psalter continuously, with each monk taking a one-hour shift. This ongoing prayer and dialogue with the Lord were not merely formal practices but expressions of deep, heartfelt devotion.  

The key lesson here is not the specific structure of their prayer life but the power of their genuine, unwavering connection to God. Through their faithfulness, the truth prevailed, and the Church endured.  

Today, we face our own challenges—wars, crises, and spiritual battles. But the example of these monks reminds us that prayer is not futile. It sustains us, strengthens us, and aligns us with God’s will. Even when darkness seems overwhelming, the prayers of the faithful can bring light and hope. Let us, therefore, remain vigilant, steadfast in prayer, and trust in the Lord’s faithfulness, just as those before us did.

The Lord provided guidance and answers to those faithful monks during times of great trial. They sought the truth, discerned how not to be misled, and understood when to take risks—even risking their lives—and when to exercise caution. This guidance did not come from rigidly following a rulebook but from constant communication with the Lord. When facing persecution and the assaults of the devil, they relied on this intimate connection with God to navigate their challenges.  

Through these monks and their unwavering faith, the Church survived. The Church of Christ endured that tumultuous period, and their example offers us lessons for our own time.  

You might think, "Well, let’s leave it to the monks. I’m just a layperson. Why should I struggle? Why should I take responsibility?" But this is a mistake. Today, we are all weaker—monks, bishops, priests, and laypeople alike. The monasteries of today are not as strong or as spiritually focused as they were in the 7th century. The clergy and laity are also weaker in faith and discipline. Yet, every one of us is called to be a combatant in the spiritual battle.  

The Lord will ask each of us, "What have you done? Why were you sleeping?" We cannot excuse ourselves by saying, "I’m not a monk," or "The monks didn’t do their job, so why blame me?" The Lord will hold us accountable for what we could have done but failed to do. We will have no answer if we neglect our spiritual duties.  

The Lord expects each of us to live an intensive spiritual life, to be vigilant at all times. While we may not be able to pray 24 hours a day like the sleepless monks, our prayers—whether twice or five times a day—matter. They contribute to the ongoing prayer of the Church. The Lord sees everyone simultaneously. He observes whether people are praying, whether they care about Him, about salvation, and about the Kingdom of Heaven. If we neglect these things, why should He support or rescue us?  

During this critical time, we must set our faces before the Lord, as King Jehoshaphat did when his kingdom was under attack. He called all of Judah to fast, recognizing that fasting strengthens prayer. Our prayers become more powerful when combined with fasting. We must cry out to the Lord: "Help us! Give us strength, guidance, and deliverance. Help Your Church and Your people overcome the evil that surrounds us."  

This is what saved the Church in the past, and it is what will save the Church today. We must not rely solely on human efforts—what politicians like Putin will do, or what we can achieve through the information war. While we should not ignore reality or escape into prayer, our primary focus must be on spiritual work. Our hearts should ache for what is happening in the world, but we must not panic or fall into despair, thinking that nothing can be done.  

It is also a mistake to adopt a passive attitude, thinking, "It’s all in God’s hands. I don’t need to worry. He will fix everything." This is a form of escapism, a spiritual drug that lulls us into inaction. We must remain spiritually alert and active. We should not fear or panic, but we must always be doing something, especially in the spiritual realm. If we can contribute in other ways, we should do so as well.  

The monks of the past were not isolated in the desert; they were actively involved in their communities—in Constantinople, Jerusalem, and elsewhere. They demonstrated the vital link between the spiritual and the physical. Their prayers and actions were intertwined, and through this balance, they preserved the faith and strengthened the Church.  

Let us follow their example. Let us pray fervently, fast when necessary, and remain vigilant. Let us not despair or become complacent but actively engage in the spiritual battle, trusting that the Lord will guide and strengthen us. Through our faithfulness, the Church will endure, just as it has throughout history.

Sometimes, the actions of the faithful—guided by the Holy Spirit—did indeed change the situation. But their focus was not merely on worldly strategies, such as whom to talk to or where to go. They were driven by the Holy Spirit, who led them to fight against heresy, schism, and all kinds of temptations, even those with political agendas. If God calls us to make sacrifices—even to die for the truth or for the testimony of the Lord—we must be willing to do so.  

Let us be wise, let us be courageous, and let us place our full trust in the Lord. We must be prepared to bear witness to the truth, no matter the cost.  

One way to tell if we are still spiritually asleep, despite the crises around us, is if we fully and unquestioningly believe one side of an issue because the media or others tell us to. If we are so entrenched in one position that we refuse to consider other perspectives, it means our souls are still asleep. Even if we are outwardly active—rallying, protesting, or speaking out—our souls remain dormant because we are unwilling to think critically or step out of our comfort zones.  

This applies not only to ourselves but also to our relatives and friends. When we see them trapped in such a mindset, it is a sign that they are still spiritually asleep. We must pray for them, help them, and gently awaken them to the truth.  

Very often, we ourselves fall prey to propaganda from one side or another. We must strive to be wise and independent, not swayed by worldly narratives. Instead, we should seek answers in the Bible, in our faith, in prayer, and in the Holy Gospel. Through these, we will receive the guidance and strength we need to navigate these challenging times.  

May the Lord grant us such a heart—a heart strengthened by prayer, fasting, and vigilance. May He guide us, protect us, and help us remain faithful to Him in all things. God bless.
