Dear brothers and sisters, there is often a very close resemblance between something that comes from God—virtue, wisdom—and something that comes from the devil—corruption, destruction, blindness.  
It may appear as though they are the same thing unless we possess two things: a deep spiritual life, which allows us to sense when something is counterfeit, and the gift of reflection. The Lord has granted us these abilities—the ability to discern spirits, to understand wisdom, and to gain knowledge. The Holy Spirit is also referred to as the Spirit of knowledge and understanding.  

Today, I want to discuss with you the topic of obedience, as it is often misunderstood within the Church, leading to false spirituality and blind obedience. Additionally, there is criticism from outside the Church, accusing us of being fanatics who do not think, who refuse to think, who are retrograde, and who lack any sense of responsibility for our actions because we blindly obey.  

This creates a significant problem. What, then, is the issue with obedience? Obedience is, in fact, a great virtue—a fundamental Christian virtue. If we desire salvation, we must be obedient to God and His will. We must follow the narrow path, which requires self-discipline and restraint, even when we are tempted to stray or pursue our own desires. We know that God’s will is paramount, and we must obey it to remain on the path to salvation and to fulfill His divine purpose.  

Let us take this step by step. First, the Old Testament presents us with the problem of people who refuse to follow God—both Gentiles and Jews. The prophets were frequently sent to the people of Israel to call them to repentance. Through the prophets, the Lord declared that Israel was a "stiff-necked" people. A stiff neck symbolizes pride and stubbornness—an unwillingness to bend or submit. It signifies a determination to follow one’s own will, regardless of what is right or true. This attitude shapes their entire lives.  

The Lord seeks to break and bend their stiff necks. He even instituted the commandment of circumcision as a reminder that they had sacrificed their lives to God. The act of cutting away a piece of flesh symbolizes the cutting away of one’s own will. It represents a turning away from being driven by personal desires and instead submitting to God’s will. However, circumcision alone does not change the heart; it serves as a reminder and a prophecy of what is to come.  

In the New Testament, this prophecy is fulfilled through spiritual circumcision. The Apostle Paul teaches that it is not those who are circumcised in the flesh who are true servants of God, but those who have undergone circumcision in the Spirit. Their spirits are circumcised, meaning they submit to and obey the Lord’s will.  

Yet, a new problem arises. Today, we see people—especially in Asia and socialist countries—who are all too willing to obey. This was evident during the crisis three years ago. People obey for the sake of safety, benefits, and acceptance by others. This is the spirit of mammon at work. The spirit of mammon operates like a vast bureaucratic system—governments, institutions, or organizations—that issues instructions, and people, like mere mechanisms, follow them without question.

And you no longer bear any personal responsibility. When asked why you do something, you simply respond, "Because I was told to. These are the instructions, and I am just following them."  

This is precisely what happened in Nazi Germany. Many of those who participated in the murder of millions of people claimed, "We didn’t know anything." This was evident during the famous Eichmann trial in Jerusalem in the 1960s. Eichmann argued, "I was just obeying orders. I didn’t do anything wrong. Millions were killed in gas chambers, but I was merely following instructions. I was just a good worker."  

Some might even say, "Look, this person is virtuous because they perform their job diligently. They don’t ask questions; they simply obey instructions. You can trust and rely on them." But this reduces a human being to a mere mechanism, a cog in a vast structure—often a structure aligned with Leviathan, the prince of this world, pursuing earthly goals. Such obedience requires no freedom, no understanding—only blind compliance.  

However, the obedience we speak of as Christians is entirely different. It demands a complete understanding of what you are obeying and why. It requires the total rejection of your old self—your laziness, stubbornness, and egoism—and a wholehearted submission to the Lord. This makes you a servant of God. In the Orthodox tradition, we even refer to ourselves as "slaves of the Lord," not merely servants. A slave belongs entirely to their master and does their master’s will. There is nothing degrading or humiliating in calling oneself a slave of God.  

Yet, everything can be perverted. We see this distortion within the Church when people refuse to think critically. The great risk here is that as the Church grew, it developed relationships with governments. In exchange for support—such as building churches, establishing Christian schools, revising laws to align with Christian morality, and advancing missions—the Church accepted help from governments. In return, governments expected the Church to support their agendas.  

This is where the danger lies. Such agendas may not align with the will of God or the teachings of Christ. Christ never endorsed secular government agendas. He said, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s" (Matthew 22:21). He also declared, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36).  

We must remember these truths. Whenever there is a sacralization of government, a nation, or a country, there is a significant risk. The agenda of mammon can creep in, replacing the will of God. People may not even notice, believing that such actions come from God. They might say, "God created this country, God established this government. We must obey its laws, for this is God’s will." This is a grave mistake and a dangerous fallacy that does occur.  

In the end, the devil will exploit these external forms of Christianity to advance his own agenda. For example, in the West and Latin America, there is a problem from the left, just as there is a problem from the right. The rightist ideology often presents itself as Christian, but the leftist ideology, such as liberation theology in Latin America, also distorts Christianity.  

For instance, I can show you this book, *Log Jesus*, which attempts to merge socialist values with Christianity, persuading people that this is the true essence of the faith. This is a dangerous distortion, as it replaces the Gospel with a political agenda.  

We must remain vigilant, discerning the spirits and ensuring that our obedience is to God alone, not to the agendas of this world. True Christian obedience requires understanding, freedom, and a heart fully submitted to the Lord. Anything less risks leading us astray.

However, they merely use an external resemblance—borrowing slogans from Christianity—while filling this ideology with entirely different content. The core of their message is completely different, making it fundamentally anti-Christian.  

Whether we are discussing rightist or leftist politics, at the end of the day, it all comes down to power. It is about control through power and force, not through love. Sometimes, it employs soft power—brainwashing, turning people into zombies.  

But we do not want to be zombies. We seek true obedience, which is an everyday sacrifice, an everyday martyrdom. The Lord tells us, "Take up your cross and follow Me" (Matthew 16:24). This cannot be blind or unconscious. It requires a deliberate choice every day. Christian obedience is an active, not passive, endeavor. It is not about blindly accepting everything without thought or understanding.  

This is why the example of Saint Mary is so profound for us. She obeyed the will of God, unlike the stubborn Israelites who chose their own path. She said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word" (Luke 1:38). She embraced God’s will, even though it would bring her shame, pain, and hardship. She resolved to follow the Lord to the end.  

May the Lord grant us such hearts. May He teach us true obedience and protect us from being distracted by revolutionary thinking that prioritizes self-confidence, freedom, and rebellion. A Christian does not worry about these things, for God is with them. Instead, we must focus on battling our "pharaoh"—the old self within us that is selfish, stubborn, blind, vicious, and driven by passions.  

We must abandon all of that, constrain ourselves, and follow the Lord. In doing so, we receive great spiritual joy. May this joy be with us always. May the Lord bless us and give us the strength to follow Him faithfully, avoiding all forms of deception. God bless.
