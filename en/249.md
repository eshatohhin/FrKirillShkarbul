# The Lent is the only Path out of the Apostasy

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church has entered into the Great Lent, and we need to thank the Lord for this opportunity to gain sight and to gain life. We discover that we are blind and dead spiritually, and that we need to return to our beloved Father, to turn to Him, and to turn away from all worldly busyness, from all immersion into the life of Mammon. We want to gain our true homeland, which is the Kingdom of Heaven.

Regarding the Great Lent, there are two significant mistakes that people often make. The first mistake is that people take it too formally, thinking that we merely need to obey certain rules—don't eat this, eat that, read this prayer—and as long as we do these things, everything is fine. This approach results in a Pharisaic spirit, where people seek vain glory and believe that external compliance is sufficient. However, internally, they remain as evil, as wicked, and as proud as they always were. Nothing truly changes; in fact, they may become worse, resembling those Pharisees who outwardly appeared righteous but were inwardly full of corruption.

The second major mistake is the opposite extreme, where people claim that they are spiritual and not like the Pharisees. They argue that it is all about talking to the Lord and being very spiritual, while downplaying the importance of practical aspects like fasting, what we eat, and how we treat others. This mindset often becomes an excuse for gluttony or spiritual laziness. Both of these views are deeply flawed. They may seem right on the surface, but both lead us astray.

What, then, is the correct approach? Unfortunately, not many Christians, even within the Orthodox Church, truly understand fasting. Many outside the Church have almost no concept of fasting, living in an illusion about God and the Gospel, with no real communion with the Lord. Even within the Church, fasting is often misunderstood due to poor examples, lack of pastoral guidance, and other reasons.

Today, I hope we can all look back to the Holy Gospel and the teachings of the Holy Fathers to understand what they have to say about this Lenten season we are entering. Before delving into this, I want to emphasize that the early Christians embraced Lent with joy. They anticipated it because they saw the great spiritual benefits it offered. They understood that Lent was a time to live out their Christian vocation to the fullest. Just as a doctor who does not practice medicine loses the meaning of their calling, or a soldier or firefighter who has no mission becomes disheartened, so too do we need this time of spiritual renewal to fulfill our calling.

This is why the Orthodox Church has so many fasting days. Lent is a time to "kill the Pharaoh" within us, to change our mindset about fasting. Our old self tells us that fasting is about deprivation, about giving up our favorite foods, and that it is a time of suffering. But this is a distorted view. Lent is not about counting the days until we can indulge again; it is about spiritual transformation, about renewing our hearts and minds, and about drawing closer to God.

Let us approach this Lent with eagerness and enthusiasm, recognizing that these holy days are a blessing from the Lord. Together, as a Church, we are fighting against evil and entering into a time of spiritual renewal and rebirth. May we all embrace this season with the right understanding and a sincere desire to grow closer to our Heavenly Father.

This old man, this Pharaoh or Cain who killed his brother, lives inside you, inside me, inside everyone. This spiritual Pharaoh, this Mammon, resides within us when we entertain such thoughts. Let us cast aside these thoughts and approach this season with a fresh perspective.

In Matthew 6:17-18, we are reminded to anoint our heads and wash our faces when we fast, so that we do not appear gloomy like the Pharisees and hypocrites. No, we are called to be joyful and radiant when we interact with others, for our fasting is an internal matter, not something to be displayed outwardly. We should not make others sad by visibly showing that we are fasting or that we are enduring a difficult time. No one needs to know. When our fasting is done in secret, it is accepted by the Lord. Whether we pray, perform acts of mercy, or fast, it must be done in secret. This is the way of the Gospel, which brings us joy. We do not fast like the Jews or Pharisees, who appear gloomy, cover themselves in ashes, and make their fasting obvious to everyone. For us, fasting is a Gospel practice.

Let us now consider what the saints have to say. St. Basil the Great tells us that angels take note and keep a record of those who fast. Imagine a church of 100 people: the angels observe who is fasting—perhaps only five. They take note of these five, recognizing that they are willing to sacrifice something out of love for the Lord. The rest may be slothful, bringing no fruit, serving Mammon, even if they attend church.

Another important teaching comes from 1 Corinthians 9:25, where the Apostle Paul says that whoever labors for the Lord abstains from everything. To take up the cross of Christ, we must abstain from all carnal pleasures. We must constrain our will, our thoughts, our intentions, and our desires. We must exercise mastery over ourselves, for it is through this self-control that our spiritual mind becomes aligned with the Lord. Only then can we truly govern even our thoughts.

If we wish to walk the narrow path—a path that is difficult to tread and followed by few—we must enter through the narrow gate. Just as a camel cannot pass through the eye of a needle, neither can a rich man enter the Kingdom of Heaven. And we are all rich—not necessarily in material possessions, but in our desires, our selfishness, and our attachments. These are the riches that weigh us down. With all this baggage, we cannot hope to enter the narrow gate. Therefore, during this Lent, let us cast aside these burdens—our earthly cares, desires, and habits. We must strip ourselves of all these things so that our hearts may be united with the Lord.

St. Basil teaches us that fasting strengthens those who labor for the Lord. It is not food that gives them strength, but the act of abstaining from food. This may seem illogical, but this is how it works. Another insight from St. Basil is that the more we deny our flesh by abstaining from food or other pleasures, the more we nourish our souls. In doing so, we obtain grace from the Lord and receive spiritual joy—not carnal joy, but a deeper, more profound joy that comes from communion with God.

This truth is echoed in Galatians 5:17, where the Apostle Paul explains that the flesh desires what is opposed to the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is opposed to the flesh. The Spirit calls us to fast, which is contrary to the desires of the flesh, while the flesh seeks pleasure, enjoyment, and relaxation. There is a constant battle between the two. If we wish to live according to the Spirit and not the flesh, we must be strict with ourselves. Some Church Fathers teach that true fasting is not merely about avoiding meat and eating other foods like pancakes or tofu. True fasting is felt when we experience hunger. While we may not feel hunger throughout the entire Lenten period, we should at least experience it a little each day. We should not eat to fullness.

St. Basil also reminds us that fasting is not just about abstaining from certain foods but about cultivating self-control and mastery over our desires. It is about redirecting our focus from the material to the spiritual, from the temporary to the eternal. By denying our flesh, we create space for the Spirit to work within us, transforming our hearts and drawing us closer to God.

Let us, therefore, embrace this Lenten season with sincerity and purpose. Let us cast aside the burdens of our earthly riches—our desires, attachments, and selfishness—and strive to walk the narrow path with humility and joy. Through fasting, prayer, and acts of mercy, may we draw nearer to the Lord and experience the true spiritual renewal that this holy season offers.

St. Basil warns us that if our hearts are unconstrained in our desires—if we constantly say, "I want this, I want that," without exercising self-control—our hearts become altars of idols. We end up worshiping idols in our hearts, which is a terrifying thought. When we fail to restrain ourselves, we open the door for the devil to enter our hearts and pollute them. This is why we must learn to constrain ourselves during Lent. True fasting, as St. Basil explains, is not merely about abstaining from food but about abstaining from evil—from all kinds of passions, habits, and desires. It is about renouncing anger, idle talk, and every form of sin. Food is important because it represents a basic desire that we often fail to control. Many of us are spoiled in our eating habits, indulging in gluttony and feeding our other passions, such as anger, greed, and more. Gluttony fuels these other vices, making it essential to address it through fasting.

St. Ephraim the Syrian, whose prayer we recite frequently during Lent, emphasizes the power of fasting. He points out that the prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament performed miracles, conquered armies, and overcame great challenges through fasting. For example, Samson crushed the gates of a city and conquered lions, and the three young men chanted in the fiery furnace without being harmed—all because of fasting. St. Ephraim concludes that fasting is absolutely necessary if we want the power of the Lord to be with us. If we desire God to participate in our lives, fasting is the key. He also notes that fasting is incompatible with anger. If we are angry, irritable, or hold grudges, our fasting becomes empty and futile.

Blessed Mark the Ascetic, a desert father from the 5th century, teaches that when we eat to the point of satiation, other desires are awakened. Just as satisfying one passion gives rise to another, fasting helps us break this cycle. During Lent, we must be mindful not to satisfy our passions. Blessed Mark also explains that prayer without fasting is useless. He compares it to trying to plant seeds in a field overgrown with thorns and weeds—the seeds cannot grow. Similarly, our prayers cannot bear fruit if our hearts are cluttered with worldly desires. Only through fasting, by killing our other desires and abstaining from worldly distractions, can we achieve pure, unobstructed prayer. Fasting and prayer work together; one cannot be effective without the other.

In summary, Lent is a time to strip away the burdens of our desires, passions, and attachments. Through fasting, we strengthen our spirits, gain self-control, and draw closer to God. By abstaining from evil and worldly distractions, we create space for prayer to flourish and for God's grace to work in our lives. Let us embrace this season with sincerity, striving to purify our hearts and align ourselves with the will of the Lord.

If you fast but do not pray, it is like cultivating a field but never planting seeds—the field becomes useless. Both fasting and prayer are necessary; they complement each other. Blessed Mark the Ascetic also warns that the greatest danger in fasting is vainglory. If we experience any success in fasting, we must not attribute it to ourselves. Our task is simply to put in the effort, and if we succeed, it is only by the grace and blessing of the Lord. We are nothing but sinners, and any progress we make is due to God's mercy, not our own strength. Therefore, there is no room for pride or vainglory. We must avoid the attitude of self-reliance, thinking, "I can do this; fasting is no problem for me." Such arrogance is detestable to the Lord, as it reflects the spirit of the Pharisees.

St. Mark concludes that whoever knows the Lord will also come to know themselves. They will see how miserable and far from God they truly are. This understanding leads to repentance, which is the key to Lent. When we repent, we recognize our wretchedness and distance from God, and this opens the door to true communication with Him. It brings us wisdom and a deeper relationship with the Lord. He references Job 42:5-6, where Job, after God reveals His creation and wisdom, realizes his own insignificance and repents in deep humility. A crushed and contrite heart, as the Psalms tell us, is what the Lord desires. Throughout Lent, we must cultivate this profound humility, acknowledging our exile from God due to our sins. The day before Lent begins is called the Memory of Adam's Exile, reminding us that we are in spiritual exile and must return to the Lord. Lent is the path of dying to this world and being reborn into the life of God.

St. Leo the Great, a 5th-century Pope and Church Father, teaches that the Lord's grace always grants victory to His saints during Lent. However, this grace does not eliminate the need for struggle and effort. Even when we achieve victories over our passions, the fight continues. We must not become complacent, thinking, "I've done enough; I can relax now." If we relax, we risk falling. Every day of Lent, we must strive for victory over our passions and desires, relying on God's grace. The battle is ongoing, with no upper limit. We must remain vigilant and engaged in the fight until the very end.

In summary, Lent is a time of profound humility, repentance, and spiritual warfare. Through fasting and prayer, we strip away our pride, recognize our need for God, and engage in the ongoing struggle against our passions. Let us approach this season with a contrite heart, relying on God's grace to guide us to victory, and never ceasing in our efforts to draw closer to Him.

This Lent should not be just another routine for us, as if it were merely a yearly event that comes and goes. Instead, we must approach it as if it were our first Lent—a time to take things seriously, to truly seek the Lord, and to knock on the door of His truth. This is the opportunity He is giving us now, this year. At the same time, we must also see this Lent as potentially our last. The Kingdom of God is imminent, and we do not know if we will have another chance. The holy fathers, when they went into the desert during Lent, would isolate themselves completely, abstaining from all communication to preserve their hearts in prayer. They forgave one another before departing, which is why we have Forgiveness Sunday. Some of them did not return, as the Lord took them during their time of fasting and prayer. This is how we must face Lent—with the urgency and seriousness of it being our first and possibly our last. If we do not approach it this way, we risk failing to achieve its true purpose.

St. Ignatius Brianchaninov, a great saint of the 19th century, reminds us that our souls are spiritual and created in the image of God. Our souls are like angels, and our physical bodies are merely instruments. If we, as spiritual beings, focus primarily on earthly matters—even ordinary, non-sinful aspects of life—we defile our souls by mixing them with temporary, worldly concerns. This leads to a fall, much like the fallen angels, and creates enmity with the Lord, as we become driven by the flesh rather than the Spirit. This does not mean we neglect our responsibilities to our families or other duties, but it is about priorities. If we focus on the Lord, everything else will fall into its proper place. During Lent, especially, we set aside many of our usual tasks and concerns. For seven weeks, we focus on the spiritual—on prayer, spiritual reading, and acts of mercy. Nothing major will happen if we leave other things aside for this time. Our focus must be on setting spiritual goals for Lent: reading the Holy Bible, the writings of the Apostles, and other spiritual literature; deepening our prayer life; and performing deeds of mercy. These should become the central concerns of our daily lives during Lent.

May the Lord help us in this endeavor. Please also make an effort to attend church and participate in the reading of the Great Canon of St. Andrew of Crete. If you cannot attend in person, read it at home. This week, every night, the Great Canon is read, and it is a profound opportunity for repentance and spiritual renewal. Let us embrace this Lent with the seriousness it deserves, focusing on our spiritual growth and drawing closer to the Lord.

Andrew of Crete. If you cannot attend church, please read it on your own. There are English translations available, or you can listen to it. This is a deeply moving service of repentance, where we witness the soul's journey back to her Creator, her loving Father. It is a powerful reminder of our desire to return to our Father and be united with Him. May the Lord grant us such a heart, fill us with His love, and enable us to live spiritually. May He overthrow all idols and passions within us, and strengthen us to remain firm on this path toward Him. May the Lord grant you joy, strength, and victory each day of this Lenten season. God bless you.
