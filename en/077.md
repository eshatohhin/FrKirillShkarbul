# Victory over Hitler and spiritual aspects of WWII

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen! We will be celebrating the Paschal resurrection of Christ for 40 days. And also, yesterday we celebrated the day of victory—victory over Hitler and fascist Nazi Germany, which occurred on May 9th, 1945. This is a great date, and we are thankful to God for this victory. We are thankful to all those who died, who sacrificed their lives so that we could have peace and life. Otherwise, it would have meant either slavery or death in concentration camps, and so on.

However, we should not become complacent. It is important to draw spiritual lessons from what happened—what were the reasons for this war, and why the Lord allowed these things, this suffering, and all these deaths to occur? Most of us in modern times have not experienced war, and we think that we will live in peaceful times. But this can end very quickly. I myself have been to a war zone and have spoken with many young people, young men who were there. Just two or three months later, I received messages that all of them were gone—they had been killed. Now, when we look at the pictures from that time, we see forests, nature, and corpses everywhere—dead people, including children and young people, so many of them. When we think about it, it is difficult to understand how God could allow this to happen. This brings us to the question: perhaps the God in our understanding is not the God as He truly is. Our perception of Him is different—it is romantic, false, fake, a kind of virtual reality that has been created, and we live in this virtual reality. But we do not know the true God—how He is, how He operates, or what His principles are. This must lead us to a very deep spiritual self-examination. We need to realize that we are far from God and that this could happen to us at any time.

Today, I want to talk about the spiritual reasons for the war and what it teaches us in these times. Why is this important? Some people say, "It's over, it's in the past, we've already won, everything is fine, so don't worry about it. Fascism is gone, Hitler is dead, and it's all over. There is no Nazism today; it has no influence." But the entire phenomenon of Nazi Germany, along with fascism in Italy, Japan, and many other places, represents the evil that exists in this world—the sickness, the sin that is present in societies. It became materialized and expressed in that way. And if we have any spiritual life, we know that after we conquer some sin, after we repent and change, it is not completely gone.

After some time, it comes back—it re-emerges. That old man inside us, that virus, returns and resurfaces, trying to pull us once again in the wrong direction. In the same way, the viruses that exist in this world on a global scale, on a societal scale, do not disappear completely. They re-emerge. This is what we forget when we celebrate, thinking, "Yes, we won, everything is great, and now it's victory." We forget that it is coming back—all these things, and much worse than they were before. Because at that time, the people in Germany, Italy, and elsewhere embraced this ideology. Those people were not inherently evil individuals who truly wanted to murder millions. Nor were they so foolish as to blindly believe everything Hitler or others told them. Yet, they accepted this ideology, supported it, and carried out its tasks. They became tools of the devil, bringing immense suffering to the world—and to themselves, of course. 

We are not immune to such brainwashing, and it is returning in different forms. The instruments of the devil are still out there, simply taking on new shapes and appearances. What is fascism? Fascism is an extreme right-wing political ideology. It prioritizes national interests above all else, and the government is empowered to use any means necessary to enforce its policies. There is no real opposition allowed, and the masses, the people, support the industry and the government. Everyone works together to achieve the set goals. On the surface, there may not seem to be anything inherently wrong with this. But if we think about it, this ideology has re-emerged many times in various societies and places. We see it in socialist countries, in similar forms. We see it now re-emerging with movements like the "Great Reset." 

On the other hand, the left—historically associated with socialism, Leninism, and Bolshevism—has shifted its focus. Today, the left is more concerned with issues like LGBT rights and similar causes. But this does not mean the left is immune to fostering fascism and totalitarianism. When the left's agenda becomes uncompromising—when it insists that certain values must be accepted without question—it can lead to the same oppressive outcomes. For example, if you do not support LGBT rights, you are labeled an enemy of the state, an enemy of society, an enemy of humanity. You are seen as a virus that needs to be eradicated. Thus, the left can also lead us down the path of fascism and totalitarianism. 

For the devil, for the antichrist, it is even more appealing to unite people in uncompromising sin than to unite them for something good. Perhaps it is half-good, but in Nazi Germany, there were still some moral values. What we may face in the future, however, is a society with entirely different moral values—values that people will defend with force and power. The devil's greater goal is to make everyone willingly embrace these values, so that there is no need for opposition, no need for concentration camps, because everyone will already be complicit. This would result in a single totalitarian government, system, and regime—what we call the kingdom of the antichrist. 

This will eventually happen at some point, though we do not know when. But we are already moving in that direction. Hitlerism and Nazism were merely rehearsals for the antichrist that is yet to come. They were just one model among many that could be imposed upon us. And we may even believe that these models are good for humanity, supporting them willingly. In fact, we could be brainwashed far more effectively than the people of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. 

So, let us remain vigilant. Let us not forget the lessons of the past, nor the spiritual truths that guide us. We must examine ourselves deeply, recognizing that the battle against evil is ongoing, and that we must remain steadfast in our faith and values.

With the low level of education many of us receive today, combined with the pervasive brainwashing from the internet—which keeps us addicted to social networks—we are constantly exposed to ideas and views that shape our thinking. We are losing the ability to think for ourselves, becoming part of a mass that relies on others to do the thinking for us. This is a dangerous trend, and it is far from over. There are two risks, two outcomes that are likely to occur. 

The first is that people become brainwashed, believing in false ideals—whether they are leftist, rightist, socialist, or something else. They become so devoted to these ideals that they are willing to die for them. They will be used as pawns in a complex game, manipulated to achieve some ultimate goal. The second outcome is the physical destruction of people, much like what happened during World War II and in the concentration camps. Millions perished, and we should not assume that we are immune to such a fate. This could happen to anyone, even to saints. And it is even more likely if we fail to establish a close connection with the true, living God. 

This connection is the only solution to the two inevitable outcomes that lie ahead. To achieve this, we must make it our highest priority to seek and crave the Lord every day. We must exert all our efforts in pursuing His truth, living in a way that is pleasing to Him, so that He cares for us. He must see that we are open to His teachings, not stubbornly going our own way. This is the solution. If we do not do this, we will be sacrificed—sacrificed to Mammon, to false idols, or to the schemes of this world. We can already see how some people are dragged by Mammon, others by false saints, and still others by various distractions. This is the modern-day Pharaoh, seeking to enslave us. 

But we must be strong. The evil in this world is not as powerful as it may seem. Some conspiracy theorists believe that everything is controlled by dark forces, that those in power can do anything they want. But this is not true. As long as we are with God, we are far stronger than any evil force. We have the power to chase away darkness, to destroy it, and to make it disappear. But the key is to remain with God. This is the solution. 

May the Lord grant us the power of His resurrection, His guidance, His wisdom, and His strength. May He help us overthrow all the schemes, plans, and deceptions of the evil that surrounds us. God bless, and Christ is risen!
