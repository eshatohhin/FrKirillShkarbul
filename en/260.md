# He will come back in the same way! Soon!

Dear brothers and sisters, last night we had a divine service here in Gaussian, and this time we are celebrating the ascension of the Lord, which began last Thursday. Now, it is a very special time from the Ascension to Pentecost—a period of 10 days. During these 10 days, we deeply reflect on what it means to be sent, to be commissioned by the Lord to bear witness.

On the day of His ascension, let us recall, He said that He was leaving us, having accomplished everything He was meant to do, fulfilling the work of God the Father. After explaining to the disciples what had happened and how the prophets had foretold His death and resurrection, He ascended into heaven, leaving us with the mission to continue His work. Yet, He also promised to be with us until the end of the age, assuring us that we would not be left as orphans.

This is a profound mystery: He is both leaving us and remaining with us. As I mentioned in my last video, human reasoning cannot fully comprehend many aspects of faith, and this is one of them. We cannot grasp it with our minds alone, but through faith and with our hearts, we can understand. We see that He is leaving because His primary task—His death and resurrection—has been completed. Now, the heavens are open, and everyone is invited to enter. It is our task to bring this message to the entire world.

On the day of His ascension, after He had spoken these words and blessed everyone, He rose into the heavens. The disciples stood there, gazing into the sky. At that moment, two angels appeared and said to them, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven." (Apologies, my cell phone fell. I will continue.) Just as He ascended, He will return on the clouds. Now, it is our task to carry the message of salvation to the ends of the earth.

We recognize that this world is finite. The span from the Ascension to the end of the world is limited, just as the span from the creation of the first man to the end is limited. The history of mankind, as we know it, is bounded in the same way our individual lives are limited. Each person is born, lives, and dies within a specific timeframe, and we are called to accomplish something meaningful during that time. This is how we are created—to fulfill our purpose within the lifespan given to us. Similarly, the world itself has a limited lifespan; it will not last forever. Therefore, we must feel the weight of this responsibility.

This world is our common home, a created world, and humanity is one family—all children of Adam. We have a task to fulfill within this world, within the timeframe given to us by the Lord. What is this task? What is the role of Christians, and what is happening right now? This is what I wanted to share with you today.

Let me begin by saying this: everything that needed to be accomplished by the Lord has been accomplished. He was crucified, He died, He rose on the third day, and He ascended into heaven. Now, the heavens are open, salvation is offered to all, and the eschatological feast has begun. Everyone is invited, and nothing can prevent you from entering into this union. You can break free from the shackles of sin, darkness, and evil—whatever holds you back. The apostles' mission is to bring this message to everyone: "You are invited. There is no need to wait or fear. The Lord is waiting for you."

What do you need? You need to listen to His words and follow His path. In doing so, you will not lose your freedom or your joy. On the contrary, you will become spiritually free and gain true joy. By stepping onto this path, you will carry the living God within you, becoming immortal, fearless, and filled with abundance. As the Apostle Paul said, "We have nothing, yet we possess everything." This truth transcends ordinary understanding.

However, we see that in the beginning, there were only a few disciples. After the Ascension, they gathered in a small house and prayed together. The world at that time was shrouded in darkness—steeped in paganism, and even the Jews, who had the law and the temple, were in darkness. They did not truly know God. As the prophet Isaiah said, Israel did not know God. They saw Him as the Creator, the Almighty, the King of the Universe, but they failed to recognize Him as a loving Father who sacrificed Himself for us. He came in meekness and humility, teaching us how to be pleasing to the Lord and revealing the mysteries of the Holy Trinity and true piety. This was vastly different from the Old Testament understanding, which was merely a shadow and a preparation. Now, the fullness of truth has been revealed through Christ.

Only those who received Christ gained true knowledge of God. Christ Himself said, "Those who receive My words are Yours, and all Yours are Mine, and all Mine are Yours. As We are one, they will be one. As I am one with You, My Father, those who receive You bear witness that You have chosen them, and the mark of Your chosenness is upon them. Those who love Me will be loved by You." This love is not the same as God’s love for all humanity. While God loves everyone, those who are pleasing to Him—in their actions, thoughts, and faith—are uniquely cherished. Our goal, brothers and sisters, is to become more and more pleasing to the Lord.

On the day of His Ascension, we were commissioned to be His witnesses, to bring the world to faith. Yet, in our times, it seems perplexing why so many remain in darkness. Why do people waste their lives in deception, enslaved by their passions, and consumed by empty pursuits? Millions spend hours watching football games or engaging in meaningless activities, obsessed with things that hold no eternal value. Why does this blindness persist, even though the Lord has opened the gates of heaven and offered salvation to all?

I want to share two recent experiences with you. One occurred in Russia, where I traveled recently, and the other here in Taiwan, where I had a dialogue with one of our faithful. In Russia, which appears to be an Orthodox, Christian country, I encountered a young woman in her twenties on the street. She approached me and said, "Father, I see you're a priest. I’m part of a charismatic community, but I feel something is wrong. We’re doing things that don’t come from God, and it feels strange. I sense that the truth lies in the Orthodox faith, but I don’t know anything about it. I don’t know anyone, and I don’t know how to approach it or what to do."

This encounter highlights the spiritual hunger and confusion that many people experience, even in places where faith seems prevalent. It reminds us of the urgency of our mission to bring the light of Christ to those who are searching for truth. Let us pray for guidance and strength to fulfill this calling, so that more may come to know the love and salvation offered by our Lord.

She continued, "So when I saw you, I decided to come over and ask you a few questions." She asked me about faith, and we had a meaningful dialogue. Eventually, she made the courageous decision to leave the charismatic sect and join the true Church. She attended a few meetings I organized during my time there, met other Orthodox believers, and is now preparing for baptism. When members of the sect tried to pull her back, she firmly told them, "No, it’s over. I’m out." By the grace of the Lord, she broke free. However, most people do not escape such groups. Why? She explained it to me.

She said, "Father, in our society, people my age know nothing about religion. It’s completely foreign to us. We don’t know anything about Christianity, Orthodox Christianity, or other religions like Buddhism or Islam. This is why we are easily drawn into these sects. They prey on people with psychological struggles, which are common today due to social issues like broken families, unhealthy lifestyles, lack of education, and more. Many people suffer from depression, addiction to drugs or alcohol, or other problems. These sects see these vulnerabilities and exploit them. They make you dependent, controlling your mind, emotions, family life, and even your finances. They use manipulative techniques to enslave you, and once you’re hooked, it takes a miracle to break free. Most people can’t do it."

She expressed deep pity for the ordinary members still trapped in these groups but had no sympathy for their leaders, who perpetuate the darkness. As the Apostle Paul said, our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the powers of darkness in this world. These forces manifest in various forms—materialism, consumerism, modernism, New Age spirituality, and more. They block the gates of heaven, claiming, "I am your salvation. There is nothing else." These are anti-Christian forces, offering false solutions like yoga, Zen Buddhism, New Age practices, or even consumerism, promising fulfillment through entertainment, drugs, or TV shows.

A few days later, I encountered a strikingly similar situation in Taiwan. Despite the cultural differences between Russia and Taiwan, the same spiritual struggle was evident. One of our faithful, a woman around the same age, shared her concerns with me. She said, "Father, even the Protestants here in Taiwan are becoming more charismatic. Traditional Protestants who once focused on Bible study, prayer, and liturgy are now either joining charismatic movements or incorporating charismatic practices into their churches. This is a growing trend."

She continued, "Here in Taiwan, there is complete spiritual blindness. People know nothing about true Christianity. They are unaware of the Orthodox faith or the depth of Christian tradition. As a result, they are easily drawn into sects and false teachings. Taiwan is deprived of the knowledge of true Christianity, and this lack of understanding leaves people vulnerable to deception."

These experiences in both Russia and Taiwan highlight a global spiritual crisis. People are searching for meaning and fulfillment but are often led astray by false teachings and empty promises. As Christians, we must recognize the urgency of our mission to share the truth of Christ, to guide those who are lost, and to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. Let us pray for wisdom, courage, and compassion as we fulfill this calling, so that more may come to know the true joy and freedom found in Christ.

I was struck by how similar the situation in Taiwan is to what I witnessed in Russia. Here, people are not explicitly forbidden from accessing religious information, as they might be in China, where firewalls block such content. Instead, in Taiwan, there is an overwhelming flood of noise—endless distractions about food, celebrities, and trivial matters. This noise bombards people from every direction: YouTube, social media, news outlets, and television. Yet, it is all empty, devoid of any real meaning or connection to salvation. It is entirely focused on this perishable, limited world, trapping people within its confines and preventing them from thinking beyond it. This barrage of distractions serves to obscure the true message of salvation and block the path to the Lord’s feast.

This task of breaking through the noise and reaching people with the Gospel is not easy. Without the Holy Spirit, we can do nothing. We must clearly understand our goal and the challenges we face, recognizing that success comes only through the Lord working through us. For example, in Moscow, the Lord placed me in the right place at the right time to meet that young woman who needed to hear the message of truth. I wasn’t actively seeking opportunities or distributing brochures—I was simply there, ready. This is what we must do: be present and spiritually prepared, ready to seize the opportunities the Lord provides.

We must prepare ourselves spiritually to boldly witness about the Kingdom of Heaven, to testify to the resurrection, and to proclaim that the power of the resurrection can transform hearts just as it has transformed ours. It can bring us out of sickness, darkness, blindness, and slavery. May the Lord grant us the Holy Spirit so that we can overcome the darkness within our own hearts, become worthy servants, and bear witness to His truth. May we produce abundant fruits of faith that are pleasing to Him and help those still trapped in the darkness of this world to find true life and salvation.

May the Lord’s blessing and the Holy Spirit be upon each of you. Amen. God bless.
