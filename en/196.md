# First Mission Trip in 2023

Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm on my way to Belize.  
It's a country in Central America that doesn't yet have an Orthodox mission.  
I'm currently transferring in Mexico, in Cancun City.  
From here, it's a short flight—about one and a half hours—on a small plane that seats only 19 people.  
I'm heading there now.  

Actually, I've been to Belize once before, about 11 years ago.  
It's a very undeveloped country.  
The roads, shops, hotels—everything there is perhaps 20 times less developed than in the neighboring Mexican province.  
You really feel the difference once you cross the border.  
Last time, I traveled by car, but this time I'm flying.  
It's quite desolate, with not many people.  
Not many people want to live there or even visit.  
Maybe that's one of the reasons why there isn't a mission there yet.  

Even though there are missions almost everywhere in Central and South America, there are only two places without one—and Belize is one of them.  
I'm hopeful that we can establish a mission there.  
I've prepared a lot of brochures and brought crosses, icons, and prayer ropes.  

Please pray that the mission of the Church can develop, that this year we can begin with good results and the fruits of the Holy Spirit in this area—a place that has been quite desolate for centuries.  
Belize is considered a refuge for people fleeing from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, the world wars, and revolts in the United States.  
It's truly the outskirts of the world.  
They even call themselves "the end of the world" or "the edge of the world."  

Well, we'll see how it goes.  
I'm asking for your prayers and support, and I hope everything goes well.  
I'll share more once I arrive.  
May God grant us His joy and blessings.  
God bless.
