# Who is the Comforter

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Pentecost!

The Holy Church is celebrating Pentecost, also known as the Feast of the Holy Trinity, and we remember that the main event is the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and the birth of the Church. This occurred after ten days of prayer following the Ascension, when the Lord instructed the disciples to remain in Jerusalem and wait for the coming of another Comforter. This Comforter is the Holy Spirit.

We recall vividly how this event unfolded: as the apostles were praying, a sound like a mighty wind, akin to a typhoon or tornado, descended from above, and tongues of fire appeared and rested upon each of them. Empowered by the Holy Spirit, they gained the extraordinary ability to preach the Gospel, proclaim the Resurrection of Christ, and bring the message of salvation to all nations. Everyone could understand them, and they were endowed with the understanding, courage, and ability to deliver this message to all people.

Yet, we often struggle to see how this event relates to us today. We may not experience dramatic transformations, supernatural abilities, or visible signs like flames of fire resting upon us. So, we might think, "Perhaps this isn’t about me." But let us reflect deeply: What does this mean for each of us? Who is the Comforter? Why is He called the Comforter? We will see that this relates directly to every one of us in every aspect of life.

First, let us recall 1 Corinthians 7:40, where the Apostle Paul advises widows who have lost their husbands that if they choose not to remarry, they will be more blessed than if they do. At the end of this passage, Paul says, "And I think that I have the Holy Spirit." He is able to discern the greater blessing that comes from such a choice. But what does it mean to be blessed or more blessed? Often, we think in binary terms: we are either saved or not saved, we either sin or do not sin. However, the New Testament emphasizes being blessed or even more blessed, rather than focusing on minimal thresholds. Blessedness comes from sacrifice—sacrificing earthly joys, such as the prospect of remarriage, to focus entirely on the Lord and faith. This sacrifice, born of love for God and made freely, brings greater blessedness. Both choices—remarrying or remaining single—can be blessed, but the latter, when done in devotion to the Lord, brings a deeper level of blessing. Of course, this assumes that one remains faithful; if one falls into sin, the blessing is lost. This free sacrifice invites the Holy Spirit to dwell within us and grants us greater blessedness.

This is why Christ’s commandments are not merely rules or prohibitions. They are about identifying who the blessed ones are, as seen in the Beatitudes: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are those who mourn, blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake." This is a crucial point I wanted to emphasize.

When the Lord tells His disciples that another Comforter will come, He does not simply say, "The Holy Spirit will come." Why does He use the term "Comforter"? The word "spirit" can mean breath or wind in Hebrew or Greek, but you cannot speak to wind or breath. However, you can speak to the Comforter. He is a person—He is the Comforter.

The Lord emphasizes that one of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit, will come. He will comfort you, be with you, and do many things for you and on your behalf. This One is called the Comforter. When we speak of the Comforter, we must be clear that we are referring to a person—the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not merely an abstract concept, such as the love between the Father and the Son, as some might suggest. Love is a bond between persons, but the Holy Spirit is a distinct person within the Trinity. This is made clear by Christ Himself. The Holy Spirit is the Comforter, the *Parakletos*. 

The term *Parakletos* comes from the Greek verb *parakaleo*, which carries several meanings. It can mean "to bring comfort or consolation," but in the context of the ancient Greek world, a *Parakletos* was also an advocate or attorney who would defend you in a trial, proving your innocence before a judge. Thus, the Holy Spirit acts on our behalf as our defender and protector. This is why the Lord says that the Holy Spirit prays for us with "groanings too deep for words" (Romans 8:26). He intercedes for us in ways that transcend human language, praying to God the Father on our behalf. This is a profound mystery. Before we begin to pray, we always ask the Holy Spirit to come, for without His presence, our prayers are incomplete.

The Holy Spirit is not like a hired lawyer who defends us for payment. Rather, He pleads for us as a friend, interceding with the judge on our behalf. He also provides us with consolation, support, and encouragement. As the *Parakletos*, the Holy Spirit exhorts and strengthens us, saying, "Go forward, you can do it." He gives us courage, eagerness, and motivation. This is another vital aspect of His role as Comforter. When the Lord tells His disciples, "Take heart" or "Be brave," or when He encourages the paralyzed man He healed, this same spirit of encouragement comes from the Holy Spirit. He is the One who empowers us to move forward.

Moreover, the Holy Spirit is described as breath or wind, bringing freshness, renewal, and the force to persevere. He enlivens us and is called the "Giver of Life" or the "Creator of Life." This is why the color green is associated with the Holy Spirit in the Church—it symbolizes life, growth, and blooming. The Holy Spirit also serves as a counselor, another meaning of *Parakletos*. When we are perplexed, troubled, or in danger, He guides us, showing us the way out of our difficulties. He provides us with power, consolation, peace, knowledge, and direction. 

In Isaiah 11:1-3, we read about the seven spirits of the Lord, which represent the sevenfold gifts or powers of the Holy Spirit. One of these is the "spirit of counsel." The Holy Spirit counsels us, offering advice and guidance in times of affliction. Like the Apostle Paul, who received divine suggestions, the Holy Spirit shows us how to live in a way that brings greater blessedness. This is not about rigid rules or commandments but about being guided toward a life of deeper blessing and fulfillment. 

In summary, the Holy Spirit, as the Comforter, is our defender, intercessor, encourager, and counselor. He breathes life into us, renews us, and guides us through every challenge, empowering us to live in greater blessedness.

The distinction between following rigid rules and seeking true blessedness is crucial. When it comes to simple commands—do this or don’t do that—you don’t necessarily need an advisor. You already know what is right or wrong. However, to be truly blessed, to strive for perfection, to fulfill God’s will, and to please Him in all things, you need the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the *Parakletos*. To take up your cross and follow Christ in every aspect of life, you need the Spirit of Truth to come down and guide you. 

Often, we seek support and advice from people—relatives, friends, or even the internet—because we lack the guidance of the Holy Spirit. While earthly advice can be helpful for practical matters, when it comes to discerning how to follow Christ, how to live a life pleasing to God, you cannot simply Google the answer or rely on human wisdom. You need to turn to God and invite His Spirit to dwell within you or be close to you. Only then can you hear His voice, receive His revelation, and gain the strength and courage to do His will. This is why we must always seek the Holy Spirit’s guidance in our spiritual journey.

Sin, on the other hand, creates its own universe. When sin enters your life—whether it is a carnal sin, a mental sin, or any form of darkness—it envelops you in delusion. It traps you in a false reality, a self-contained world where you are unable to see beyond your own desires, obsessions, or fears. This could manifest as heresy, a misguided philosophy, an obsession with material wealth, comfort, family, business, or even hobbies. Whatever it is, sin closes you off from the truth, confining you to a spiritual shell. Only the Holy Spirit can break through this darkness, revealing God’s will and guiding you out of delusion. Without Him, there is no true freedom or clarity.

The devil, however, offers a counterfeit choice: fake revelation, fake enlightenment. He masquerades as an angel of light, presenting false paths to salvation. For example, some people believe that progress, science, or modern ideologies have replaced faith, dismissing religion as medieval superstition. Others turn to philosophies like Buddhism, seeking enlightenment apart from Christ. These are all deceptions. As the Lord said, "If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!" (Matthew 6:23). We must not be deceived by false lights or empty promises. Whether it’s the allure of wealth, self-help techniques, or the illusion of being smarter or more enlightened than others, these temptations are rooted in a spirit of anti-Christian deception. They promise salvation without Christ, creating a false reality—a personal Babylon or metaverse—that distracts us from the truth.

True enlightenment and freedom from delusion come only from the Holy Spirit. There are countless fake spiritualities in the world—meditations, carnal fantasies, or teachings from false saints—that lead people astray. These are either psychological distortions or demonic deceptions. We must cling to Christ and the true spirituality given to us by the Holy Spirit, as revealed through the Holy Fathers of the Church, who were guided by the same Spirit. Only in Christ, through the Holy Spirit, can we find the truth, the light, and the path to eternal life. Let us remain vigilant, rejecting all false lights and embracing the true light of Christ, who alone can save us.

May the Spirit of the Lord come down upon every one of us. May He enlighten our hearts, give us strength, grant us peace, and fill us with eagerness to testify to this truth before all people. When individuals or groups are trapped in delusion—living within their own self-constructed worlds—they often react with hostility or indifference when confronted with the truth of Christ. This is because Christ and His message threaten their false realities and counterfeit salvations. Whether within families, among the Jews who persecuted the early Church, or among pagans who opposed it, the reaction is the same: hatred, marginalization, or ridicule. They see Christ as a threat to their worldview, their false sense of security, and their delusions. This is why the world hates the real Christ, not the fabricated or watered-down version. The Church will always face persecution because darkness cannot coexist with light. Even if the world pretends to be polite or tolerant, it ultimately rejects Christ and true salvation, for His light exposes and undermines its lies.

The Holy Spirit, while defending and protecting the righteous, also accuses and judges the sinful world. As the Lord said, the Holy Spirit will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). He exposes sin and condemns it, making the world uncomfortable when its darkness is revealed. This is why those who cling to sin often react with hostility when confronted with the truth—they feel exposed and condemned. Let us be aware of this reality and not fall victim to the world’s delusions. Instead, let us cling to Christ, the true Light, and allow the Holy Spirit to guide us, strengthen us, and reveal God’s will to us.

May the Lord forgive all our sins, strengthen our path, and fill us with His light and encouragement as we strive to follow Him. Dear brothers and sisters, I wish you a blessed and joyful Pentecost. May the Holy Spirit dwell richly in your hearts, transforming you and empowering you to live as witnesses of Christ’s truth in a world that so desperately needs His light. Merry Pentecost!
