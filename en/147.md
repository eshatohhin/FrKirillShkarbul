# Exposing the plan of devil

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
We are in this Paschal celebration, in this joy, and we will remain in it for 40 days.  
Even though the world is in darkness, pain, and deceit, we still have the great joy of the resurrected Lord.  
I hope that even when the final Antichrist comes and reigns, and things become truly difficult for faithful Christians, we will still hold onto this Paschal joy and celebration.  

Last time, we discussed war and whether the Church supports it. Today, I want to build on that and offer more concrete conclusions, statements, and a vision for the future—especially what each of us must do. I also hope today’s message will help everyone develop a better worldview. After all, everything we do stems from the worldview we hold. It shapes how we interpret the news and the world around us.  

I’ve mentioned before that we must move beyond a two-dimensional (2D) reality—this simplistic "either-or" mindset. Many people passively absorb what the media or certain speakers say and form a flat understanding of the world. But what is flat? Flat lacks spiritual depth. If we are to be children of Christ, His soldiers, and carry out His mission, we must cultivate a spiritual life and a worldview with a spiritual dimension.  

Simply listening to me is not enough. We must learn to live spiritually, to live in Christ, to pray, to align our lives with the Holy Gospel, to repent, to unite with Christ, and to receive the Holy Eucharist. Nevertheless, I want to share my thoughts on what is happening in the world.  

The plan of the "Prince of this World"—whether you call it Satan, the spirit of Antichrist, or something else—has become evident to me. I’m not imposing my view on you; I simply want to share my insights so far. This plan appears to be highly successful, yet it is horrifying—especially when viewed without faith. If we see it only through human eyes, as though we are alone in facing this reality, it seems overwhelming. But we are not alone. We have the Lord, and He has His own plan—a plan far wiser, more comprehensive, and perfect. There is nothing better than His plan.  

We must increasingly become part of His plan. Remarkably, He is even using the Antichrist and all the evil in the world to achieve His purposes.  

Now, let’s discuss the darker aspects. What is this plan? In short, it is to dismantle "Greater Russia"—Rus, which encompasses Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, historically united—and to weaken the Russian Orthodox Church, the largest Orthodox Church. The goal is to fracture the Orthodox Church, rendering it powerless and without influence.  

What does it mean to "cancel" Russia or the Church? It doesn’t mean they vanish into a void or are annihilated. Rather, it means stripping them of their identity and integrating them into a post-Christian, anti-Christian world order.  

We must also reject two prevailing political worldviews. The first is the narrative of the "free world" trying to stop a "crazy Russian president" from attacking Ukraine. This narrative is false. The second is the opposite view: that Russia is striving to restore its former empire, combat Western anti-Christian values like sodomy, and reunite Ukrainians under the belief that they are one people with Russians. This, too, is misleading.  

Both perspectives are flawed. Instead, we must seek a deeper, spiritual understanding of these events, rooted in faith and aligned with God’s perfect plan. Let us pray, repent, and unite with Christ, trusting in His wisdom and sovereignty over all things.

That’s another worldview, promoted by Russia. Many people in Russia—and not only there—believe this narrative and place their hope in Russia because of it. However, this view is also incorrect.  

The more accurate perspective is this: there is darkness at work in the world. This darkness encompasses everything we’ve seen unfold, including the so-called "modern sickness" we’ve endured for over two years, the measures taken in response to it, and the ongoing war. These events are not isolated; they are interconnected and part of the Antichrist’s plan.  

From the Holy Scriptures, including the Apocalypse—the revelation given to Saint John about the future—we understand that this darkness seeks to overcome the light. What is the light? The light is Christ and His Church—not merely the institution, but the people united with Him, faithful to Him, and carrying out His mission. These people are few, very few, while the darkness is vast and growing.  

This darkness operates through economics, politics, and every available means, exploiting human passions and blindness. It is a comprehensive, all-encompassing force. The Devil, like a roaring lion, seeks to devour even the chosen ones.  

Here’s the conclusion we can draw: this darkness is playing both sides. It manipulates governments everywhere—in Russia, Ukraine, and across the globe. The agenda is unified, and people are deceived into thinking, “There’s a war between Russia and Ukraine.” But it’s a game, a grand trick. Both Russian and Ukrainian people are caught in the Devil’s trap.  

The Devil’s goal is not merely to ensnare a few Christians; he aims to devour the entire Orthodox Church. But we will not allow this. Through propaganda and deception, he has convinced many that the Russian leader is a good Orthodox Christian fighting for a righteous cause. But this is false. He is neither Nicholas II nor Stalin.  

Historically, the First World War was orchestrated by those who rule the world, partly to dismantle the Russian Empire. When that didn’t go entirely as planned, the Second World War followed, targeting Stalin and the Soviet Union. Again, their plans were not fully realized.  

I won’t delve deeper into politics, as this message is not about politics. However, I am not ignorant of these matters. I have lived in both Russia and Ukraine, studied in Ukraine, spent my childhood there, and have many Ukrainian relatives. I’ve also lived most of my life in Russia, and our parish consists mainly of Ukrainians and Russians. I speak from experience and understanding when addressing politics, nationalism, and ethnic issues.  

The key takeaway is this: we must see beyond the surface, beyond the narratives fed to us. We must recognize the spiritual battle at play and align ourselves with Christ’s light, resisting the darkness that seeks to divide and destroy. Let us remain vigilant, faithful, and united in Christ.

So, they couldn’t achieve their goals immediately with Stalin at that time. They tried, but eventually, after his death and the fall of the Soviet Union, the next phase of the "New World Order" emerged. Now, they aim to escalate this further, and to do so, they need to completely dismantle Russia.  

This process resembles what happened with Iraq. They allowed Iraq to invade Kuwait, then intervened to remove Saddam Hussein, and years later, his regime was toppled. Similarly, Putin is being cast as the "bad guy." He invades, stirs conflict, and eventually, he will be removed. This will lead to turmoil in Russia—perhaps famine, suffering, and chaos. After such devastation, the people may be willing to embrace the New World Order, losing their identity, faith, and culture in the process. Russia will not be annihilated entirely, but its essence will be erased, and it will be fully integrated into this new global system.  

The agenda of the so-called "fancy sickness" (the pandemic) also contributes to this plan, paving the way for a single, absolute power to dominate the world. While there are powerful groups—deep states, influential families, or clans—that control much of the world, their control is not yet absolute. The Antichrist, however, seeks total and absolute control. This is one of the goals of the "Great Reset." Democracy will continue to decline, replaced by a new form of socialism, achieved through a series of revolutions. This aligns with Trotsky’s idea of permanent revolution: breaking everything down to bring about a new leader and system.  

Admittedly, the picture I’ve painted is dark and gloomy. But with the Lord, darkness is nothing. We have no fear—not of the Antichrist, not of anything. Throughout history, we’ve faced great Antichrists who killed and deceived millions. The current one is not unprecedented, though it is more global, total, and cunning. Yet, we will not give up so easily. The Devil believes he can succeed, but if we remain steadfast in Christ, his plans will fail.  

The power of this darkness lies in money, influence, economics, and human passions—hatred, pride, greed, lust, and the like. It seeks to trap people in a utopian illusion of virtual reality and materialism. But for those who choose to follow Christ and serve as His ministers, our power lies in faith. This power can overthrow everything, for the Lord is with us. Like David and Goliath, the giant may seem overwhelming, but with God, even a single stone can bring it down.  

Even if we are few—just one, two, or three people—we can, with the Lord’s help, overthrow these plans. Of course, it may be that the Lord permits this "Golgotha" to unfold for His greater purpose. We do not know His full plan. But in any case, we must be ready and unafraid. Our faith in Christ is our strength, and with Him, we can face any darkness. Let us stand firm, trusting in His power and His perfect will.
