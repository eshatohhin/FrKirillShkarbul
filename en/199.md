# Spiritual War How to Win

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a time when, according to Apostle Paul, the one who is holding off is taken away. We remember the mystery of lawlessness. This is the evil plan of pulling all of humanity into destruction. And this plan is called the mystery of lawlessness. There is a mystical, secret plan. This is biblical conspiratology. Apostle Paul tells us about this conspiracy of the devil against humanity. And there is the one who is holding off, and he has already been taken away. We live in a time when this plan is being accomplished rapidly.

The two things that are still partly holding off the Antichrist from coming are, first, on the social level, there are still some remaining elements from the time when these societies were either Christian or when these societies were normal human societies with traditional values—maybe not Christian, but they had an understanding of what marriage is, what sin is, and what evil is. These societies, both Christian and pagan, which were living according to conscience, have been transforming for many years already. But still, they are not completely perverted yet. There is still some social understanding of what is good and what is bad. And it is still keeping this evil at bay to some extent. However, it is getting weaker and weaker.

The second thing that is keeping this evil at bay is, on the individual level, the individual warriors of Christ—people who are spiritually awake and who are standing firm, fighting against evil both within themselves and in the world. And these people are very few. Now, during the Great Lent, we are called to wage this war against the devil. So it is very important for us not to misunderstand the purpose of this warfare, this struggle, because there are many mistakes. People who are outside the Orthodox, true Church are, of course, completely misoriented. They do not have the grace and the union with Christ to receive the grace, revelation, and power needed to withstand this. So they fall victim to many things—to this blindness, to this deception. But unfortunately, even the Orthodox often fall victim to this deception. And the reason is that the goals are either fake, or we take secondary goals and make them the primary goals of this struggle.

What am I talking about? Some people say that the goal is not to sin. Well, it is an important goal, but it is not the main goal. The more important goal, of course, is to fight against the passions that cause this sin. If we are already sinning, of course, we cannot talk about other goals if we are already sinners. If we are sinning on a regular basis, we need to do away with this sin and fight against the passions that cause it. However, this is not the only goal. Some goals, which are also not the primary goals, include believing in the true way, remaining Orthodox, and not slipping away into heresy, schism, Protestantism, Catholicism, or something else. If you go away from the Church, from the true faith, well, this is a goal. However, this is not the primary goal. This is a secondary goal because the Jews of the time of Christ were standing in the true faith. They were Orthodox. However, this did not save them from deception and from the blindness of not recognizing who the Messiah was. So they became children of the devil and were later rejected, losing their chosenness. So it is not enough just to preserve the true faith, to believe in the right way, with no error, no mistake, no heresy in what you believe. Well, as a matter of fact, many Orthodox do not even know what makes them Orthodox. What are the errors of other confessions, heretical confessions? We need to know this at least. But even knowing this is not enough.

Another common mistake is when people say that the goal is to keep the service, the liturgy, in the right way—to just do everything correctly.

Don't stop the liturgy; just go, and everything will be fine. We saw this during the virus when some churches were locked, and people were mostly concerned that at least the liturgy had to continue. Maybe no one could enter the church, but at least the priests should perform the liturgy. At least there is this mystical connection that unites us with God. It’s going on. This is the goal. This is the purpose. Well, of course, it’s really bad to stop the liturgy. But simply keeping the liturgy going cannot guarantee us victory in the spiritual struggle. In the time of the Lord, the liturgy was also performed in the temple in Jerusalem in the right way, and they continuously carried out the correct liturgy. Yet, this was not enough for them to receive grace and become children of God. So, this is not enough. It’s important, but it’s not sufficient.

Now we see how tens or hundreds of thousands of Orthodox die from the virus, from war, from hunger, and from many other causes. Why? Why is this happening? We ask, has the Lord abandoned the Church? Or perhaps the people who call themselves Christians or Orthodox Christians were not acting according to the will of the Lord. If you die as a martyr, that is one thing—it is a great honor and a gift from the Lord. But if you die from a car accident or suddenly fall ill from some trivial sickness and die without purpose or meaning, I think something was wrong. And it’s not just my opinion; we can find this in the Bible. To better understand the promises of the Lord and what it will be like when we become His children, let us read Psalm 91, just a few passages.

Verse 1: *"He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."* To abide in the shadow of the Almighty means to be under His protection. He is protecting you.

Verse 3: *"Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence."* For example, epidemics. *"He will deliver thee from that; you will not die in that pestilence."*

Verse 7: *"A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand."* You will prevail over ten thousand people. And ten thousand signifies an unlimited number. Now we are afraid: *"Oh, maybe something will happen; I don’t have insurance, I’ll lose my job, my boss will be angry with me, and I’m finished. Everything is finished."* We are afraid of all that. But here it says, *"No, you’re not afraid—not just of one boss, but of ten thousand enemies who come to kill you. You won’t be harmed by that if you abide in the shadow of the Almighty."* He will take you under His wings.

Verses 14–16: *"Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him."* This is talking about the faithful—if he loves the Lord, the Lord will deliver him. *"I will set him on high because he has known My name."* So, the Lord will set you on high if you know His name. It’s so easy to say, *"Just love the Lord, just know His name."* It’s easy to say, but how do we become like that? *"I will be with him in trouble."* Do we have Him with us in our troubles? *"With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation. I will give him long life, a multitude of days; I will bless him with longevity."* Yet, so many people die at 30 years old, 40 years old—priests, bishops, monks. What’s the matter? And they don’t die as martyrs; they die from something trivial, like a virus or something else. Why? Because this psalm is not just telling us, *"Oh, this is what’s happening; you didn’t know that you will be covered by the wings of the wind."* Yes, He covers you with His wings. This may sound like fairy tales or fantastic stories because it doesn’t match reality.

So, what’s wrong here? What’s wrong with this psalm and these promises we hear about? The problem is not with the Lord. The problem lies within us. We are spiritually asleep. We don’t want to wake up. We allow ourselves to be brainwashed by what we hear, living like everyone else. And everyone else, of course, worries about everything on this planet. We worry because we don’t trust the Lord. We’re anxious about losing our jobs, about conflicts with our spouses, about so many things—because we don’t trust Him. We need to learn how to trust Him. We need to awaken our hearts, love Him, and seek His truth, His righteousness, and His will every day, from morning till night. This is what makes us children of Christ—not just observing rituals or holding the right faith. These things are very suitable for spiritual sleep. 

We think, *"Okay, now I know I’m Orthodox, so I have the right faith. Okay, now I know I perform the divine liturgy correctly. I’m fine. Everything is fine. So I just go to sleep. I don’t have to worry about anything."* And in doing so, we become alienated from God. Our prayer becomes like reciting a mantra, just repeating words. Our faith turns into superstition. So many people say, *"Oh, what will happen? Now we have the big monastery in Kiev, and the government is about to chase away the monks."* Even some monks and priests say, *"Well, whatever the Lord decides will happen."* This is spiritual sleep. The Lord can change everything if you trust in Him, if you rely on Him. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but if you trust in Him, you will not be harmed. If you don’t trust Him, even one person can come and destroy you. It’s not about passively accepting whatever happens as God’s will. That’s not faith; that’s surrender. It’s capitulation to evil, disguised as piety. It’s like believing in fate, which is paganism.

This is the problem we face. Let us awaken. Let us set the goal of waking up spiritually, of killing off our passions, of fighting against our sins and bad habits. Let us strive to learn more about the Lord, about His will, and do something to serve Him, to live according to His commandments every day, and to accumulate treasures in heaven. May the Lord help us, giving us understanding of why we fast, what spiritual struggle is, and what spiritual warfare entails. We must feel the evil power trying to seduce us, trying to oppose us. Satan means "the one who opposes"—he opposes God and His Church, especially those who are alive in His Church, not those who are asleep, who convince themselves that everything is fine and need no opposition because they are already defeated in their slumber.

May the Lord help us, give us His blessing, strength, revelation, and spiritual growth during this Lenten season, and grant us victory over all adversaries. Amen. God bless.
