# If we lose our Messianic goal, the world will end.

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about messianism and our mission as Christians. Very often, we perceive our faith as merely belonging to a religion, following some traditions, praying, and reading the Bible. But our faith is more than this. In fact, the most important aspect is not these practices. The most important thing is that Christ gave His Church His own mission. He came Himself, as the Messiah, bringing salvation and liberation to all humanity. He entrusted this mission to His Church, His disciples, making them His messengers, apostles, and representatives to the whole world. And they went out into the world to fulfill this mission.

Right now, the problem is not with the mission itself but with us. We are weak, selfish, and complacent. We do not perceive our faith in this way. As a result, the Church is becoming increasingly passive and individualistic. Everyone is focused only on their own concerns. People think, "For me, it’s enough just to get into heaven, and that will suffice. I’ll focus on that. Anything else is not my problem." This is a wrong spirituality, a wrong perception of our faith. Our faith calls us to be witnesses of Christ and to embrace this shared mission, which is more important than anything else in this world. It is even more important than our daily responsibilities. We are so immersed in the routines of life, just doing what we are supposed to do, that we live in a box. But the Lord wants us to step outside this box. This does not mean abandoning all our responsibilities, but it does mean making His message our first priority.

The early Christians declared, "Now is the era of the Messiah, and we are His messengers." Their task and goal were to bring this message, this testimony, and this truth to the ends of the world. This mission is not reserved for a select few or saints—it is for everyone. Every Christian has this responsibility, right where they are. Yet, we see that political ideas often unite people more strongly than this mission does. Why? Because Christians no longer feel this mission. Our souls have lost their saltiness. This is the problem. When you have a mission, you have a firm foundation for your actions, thoughts, and goals. But we have lost this foundation. We need to understand and recover it.

We see that many political parties can rally, protest, and take to the streets, risking their futures and jobs for an idea. We see followers of other religions, such as Muslims, willing to risk their lives and lose everything for their beliefs. I am not saying these ideas are true or good, but they are willing to act on them. Nationalists, liberals, and others in various countries are willing to sacrifice for the ideas they believe in. But what about us? We are doing almost nothing. Of course, I am not calling for people to take to the streets—that is not necessary right now. But we must understand that our gatherings in the Church are of great importance. We come to Church not just to pray for ourselves but as a community of Christ’s messengers. We come to receive the true message, to be together, to support one another, to discuss how we face challenges, what is happening in the world, and what we should do. We come to share our experiences and faith. This is incredibly important for us.

It has to be. In this era of globalization, we see that even nations are losing their cultural codes. Strong nations like the German, French, and many others once had a mission and a message to bring to the world. But with globalization, people no longer feel they have something unique or special to contribute. As a result, these cultural codes are dissolving and disappearing. For us Christians, however, no matter our nationality, the primary cultural code is Christianity—our faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This must remain strong, fruitful, and a living testimony. We must feel that we are messengers, every one of us. 

When someone is a messenger—commissioned to a specific task or mission, perhaps even sent to another country—they think about it constantly. It defines who they are and shapes their spirituality. Others see a mystery in them, something compelling. We, as Christians, are meant to carry an even greater mystery within us because of the commission and mission we have received from our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us feel this responsibility deeply, for Christ will ask us when we meet Him: "What did you do? How did you testify about Me? Were you truly My follower?" He will not ask if we owned a cross or a Bible, but whether we lived as His witnesses. 

Let us be strong and ready to sacrifice everything, to take risks for our faith in Christ. Otherwise, we will dissolve, just as many nations are losing their identity in the globalization paradigm. If we fail, the world will lose its purpose. We must not allow ourselves to fade away. May the Lord give us strength, a sense of mission, eagerness, and self-awareness. Who are we? What is our task? What is our goal? What is our motivation? With this strong code, we can stand firm. If necessary, we can take to the streets, pray all night, and live boldly because we are with Christ. He is everything to us. 

We are not a club for occasional interests or rituals. We are not an office of spiritual routines or a clinic for relaxation, spiritual needs, or emotional comfort. We are not a psychiatrist or a provider of spiritual opium for the masses. No, we are the army of Christ, His messengers, carrying out His mission for the salvation of the world. May the Lord help you, bless you, and give you His strength and power. Amen.
