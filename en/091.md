# Mission in Guam. Part 2 Mission Experience

Dear brothers and sisters, today is the second video about Guam and the mission here.  
Now I am in the center of Guam, heading towards some villages to continue distributing brochures, meeting people, and making new friends.  

I want to say a few more words about Guam itself and our mission here.  
Guam is the largest of the Mariana Islands, and the Mariana Islands are named after Saint Mary.  
So, we ask for Saint Mary's prayers and help in our mission, as the people who live here, the Chamorros, are essentially people of Saint Mary.  
This is interesting and connected to history.  

The history is that Magellan arrived here exactly 500 years ago, in 1521.  
However, the Catholic mission began later, in the late 1600s.  
I was surprised to learn that there was also an Orthodox mission in this region.  
It is documented that in 1817 and 1828, ships came to Guam and other islands.  
They even settled in the northern part of the island, where the U.S. airbase is now located, and established an observatory there.  
There was a settlement with scientists working at the time.  

Some locals also say that a church was established in Anatakhan, a volcanic island to the north.  
This island experienced eruptions from 2003 to 2007, and no one lives there anymore.  
However, at that time, there was a Chamorro population, and the Russians came, established a settlement, and built a church.  
I am still trying to find documentation on this, as it is currently based on local stories.  
But it is documented that they came to Guam during the two missions I mentioned.  

This is inspiring for us because it is always good to continue the work of other missionaries.  
We should not be proud, thinking we are the first or that we are something special—we are nothing.  
The spirit of a missionary should be humility, recognizing that we are in a place by the Lord's grace, not by our own achievements or talents.  
We are simply continuing the work of others, who are likely saints.  

I want to do more research on this, and if I find new information, I will share it with you.  
I am also planning to visit the northern islands to see what remains there.  
I am not sure which islands I will be able to visit, but this is part of the plan for this time.  

Guam itself is rooted in Chamorro culture, but the Chamorro population now makes up less than one-fourth of the total population—perhaps one-fourth to one-third.  
In fact, there are fewer Chamorros than Filipinos living here, along with other nationalities such as Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, and Caucasians, including Russians.  
It is surprising that the Aboriginal population is now a minority, even though Chamorros are visible everywhere.  
The south has a Chamorro majority, and the mentality differs between the south, center, and north.  
I won’t delve deeper into this right now.  

The mission here is quite different from places like Papua New Guinea or East Timor.  
Here, people do not immediately surround you as a foreigner handing out brochures.  
There is a social distance, partly due to the COVID-19 situation, and people are not as open.  
However, they are more open in the south.  

I have discovered that people are more receptive in residential neighborhoods.  
The mission strategy here involves driving through these neighborhoods, where people feel more confident and are curious about who is visiting their area.  
The pace is slower, and people are not in a rush.  
Sometimes, you see workers, such as construction workers, taking breaks, which provides opportunities to connect with them.

So, it’s easier to talk to them or at least give them a brochure, say hello, and find that people are more responsive.  
This is the mission tactic we can use here in Guam, as well as in other developed capitalist countries like the U.S.  
I think it’s an effective way of doing missions.  

Another tactic that works is this: once you have a few local friends, ask them to tell their friends about Orthodoxy and that a missionary or priest is visiting Guam.  
This is an event, something people don’t experience every day.  
Word spreads like news, and others become curious to learn more.  

This more traditional approach to mission can be complemented by modern technology.  
For example, I made a video introducing myself, explaining what Orthodox faith is very briefly, and inviting people to learn more, meet, talk, subscribe to our channels, or join our Zoom prayers.  
This makes it easier for friends to share the message—they can simply send a link via SMS or WhatsApp.  
People can then decide if they want to meet me or not.  
Some call me, we meet, talk, and become friends.  
This is a nice and effective way of doing mission work here.  

What else have I noticed?  
Most people here know each other.  
The island isn’t that big, so they know who you are, who your relatives are, if you have common relatives, what you’ve done, or even what your grandfather did.  
It’s still quite traditional and interconnected, which can be helpful for the mission—unless you do something bad, in which case everyone will know about it.  

This creates a different mission mentality compared to larger countries, where I call it the "railway station mentality."  
In big countries, it’s like a railway station with a constant flow of people passing by.  
You might give them something or interact briefly, but it’s always changing.  
Here, it’s more like a family setting.  
The people I talk to today are likely people I’ll meet again.  
It’s a close-knit community, so the approach needs to be different.  

For example, I met a Russian guy who has been here for less than three years, and yet a lot of people know him all over the island.  
He has friends everywhere.  
He’s white, Russian, and people can tell where he’s from.  
He’s quite well-known.  
If there were a missionary priest here, everyone would know him—whether they became friends with him or not, they would at least know who he is and what he represents.  

These are some particular aspects of the mission here.  
You need to understand the relationships between the Chamorros in the south, the west, and those in the U.S. mainland.  
For instance, the locals don’t always have good relationships with the soldiers stationed here.  
You need to be aware of these nuances but rise above them.  
Your focus should be on sharing Christ, the Gospel, and inspiring people.  

Many people here come from a Catholic tradition, and Catholicism is considered the majority religion—about 95%.  
However, in reality, only about 10-15% attend church regularly.  
Many are upset with the Catholic Church for various reasons—some have joined sects, others are searching for something else, and some have become indifferent to religion altogether.  
This is why there are so many sects, cults, and similar groups here.  

These are the people who might become Orthodox.  
Already, we have quite a few who are interested in Orthodoxy, and I believe there will be many more.  
It’s important to understand and feel the pain of these people, to connect with them, and to offer them the truth and beauty of the Orthodox faith.

This pain stems from colonial times and the treatment they endured, as well as the memories of war.  
Many people were killed here in Guam and Saipan, particularly during the Battle of Saipan.  
When the Japanese were here, this was their last line of defense—beyond this was Japan itself.  
When the Americans attacked, there were massive battles, and many lives were lost on this soil.  
Not just soldiers, but also regular Chamorro civilians.  
Almost everything on the islands was destroyed.  

These memories are deeply ingrained.  
I visited the museum here yesterday, and it’s essential to feel this history, to connect with the land, and to love this place and its culture.  
Yesterday, I went to a Chamorro cultural site.  
Much of Chamorro culture was destroyed due to colonial influence and policies.  
It’s important to help them restore their history, culture, and language.  
All of this can be done, and it should be done.  

May the Lord help us.  
Please pray for the mission here on these islands, so that more people may come to the Church, become Orthodox, and be united with Jesus Christ.  
May the Lord help you and bless all of you.
