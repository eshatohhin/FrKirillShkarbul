# How does the prince of this world make Christians blind

Dear brothers and sisters, we are living in very dangerous times. These are the times when the devil is trying to hack the church. Of course, he has been trying to hack the church for all these centuries. However, now he has had some success. He hasn't succeeded completely, and he will never have full victory over the church. But now he has made some progress. Okay, and this is something I want to talk about. How can he succeed in deceiving individual Christians, local churches, and maybe even the whole church? Well, maybe 20-30 years ago, I could have confidently told you that all other so-called churches, denominations, Protestants, and Catholics had already been conquered by the devil. Okay, they are not an obstacle for the devil. Okay, because morally, of course, they fell from grace as soon as they broke away from the Orthodox Church. But they still had some healthy values; they still had many things that were not pleasing to the devil. But now, it's all gone. Okay, just individual people are still trying to do something, but in general, these churches, no matter how big—you see now how big the Catholic Church is—are completely subdued by the devil and the spirit of this world. In a way, how they support all these perverts and other stuff. So, in those days, I could tell you that the only obstacle now for the devil is the Orthodox Church of Christ. The devil is unable to hack, unable to penetrate the walls of this fortress, and it is the greatest danger for him in this world because it is not allowing him to overcome, to overtake the whole world, which is his dream, his plan. However, nowadays, we are experiencing great challenges, great challenges, and this wall already has some cracks. Okay, and this doesn't mean that the words of Christ—that the devil will not overcome the gates of hell, will not overcome the church which was established by Christ—that will never happen. However, to understand what that means, we need to think about the grace which we perceive within the church, which has never diminished, and the truth that we find in the church; it's always been there. But when we are talking about big things, like a general attitude or some norms, some attitude towards fasting or towards what's going on in the world, these things, these trends, they can change. The church people, even many, even hierarchy, bishops, patriarchs, that can change, and it is important not to be too reliant these days on just belonging to the Orthodox Church.

First of all, let us talk about the idea of being hacked. On an individual level, someone can be hacked. You have a child; you were bringing him or her up with healthy values, in good company, with good books, everything. However, at the age of 15-16, you discover that he or she is now becoming different. You cannot penetrate into his mind, but you can see that he is now smoking or has tattoos, piercings, swears sometimes. It's different; it's already a different person. You are surprised at what happened. After a few years, you discover that he is stealing, that he is doing drugs and something else, and you are wondering what is going on. But you could see that his heart has been hacked, maybe in that early moment. It's being hacked; it's already a different person; it's been stolen. The snake has crept into his or her heart, and now it's a different person already. And similar things happen with governments, with corruption, and that's why it's called corruption. It's corrupting, spoiling. When people who are responsible for the country, who are responsible for the well-being and for the justice in this country, they are selling their conscience, they are selling their people, their country for bribes, for money. This is adultery. Any kind of hacking, any kind of penetration by the devil is some form of hacking, being hacked, being the betrayer.

Judas sold Christ for thirty pieces of silver. And this spiritual adultery takes many forms and shapes. Unless we are extremely vigilant and hold fast to the gospel of Christ, to the Holy Church, and to the Holy Communion, we will be hacked. No matter if we call ourselves Orthodox or non-Orthodox, we will be hacked. Today, let me briefly explain what has happened and why this is occurring.  

The main reason is this relaxation. After the totalitarian and Bolshevik governments, after the wars—the First World War, the Second World War—the time of peace led people to become complacent. The new paradigm that everything is allowed, that it's liberal, that everything is fine, has taken hold. "No devil. What devil? Who is the devil? You can do whatever you want, believe whatever you want, buy whatever you want, go wherever you want." This liberal mindset has blinded people, including people of the church. And this is why it has become more natural for church members to simply become part of society. If society is brainwashed—whether by TV, as it used to be, or now by bloggers, YouTube, and all these platforms—it’s the same brainwashing with all those algorithms and filters. Now, it’s just a matter of fact: who are you watching? Okay, you're watching this blogger or that blogger, and that’s how you think. This has become very different from how we understand ourselves as Christians, set apart from the rest of the world, which lies in evil. We listen to Christ, and that’s it. In the gospel, in the church, and that’s it. In the monastery, among the monastics, and that’s it. We don’t listen to influencers or anything else. But now, it’s different.  

Of course, this didn’t happen all of a sudden. There was a long preparation. From the first centuries, the devil has been trying to hack the church. He was inventing all kinds of heresies—some very strict, some very lax. Some said, "Now we are free—no morals, no laws. Just do whatever you want," indulging in all kinds of sins. The church was able to overcome all these errors. Perhaps in those days, those attacks were even stronger than today, but the church was also stronger. The church people were stronger. I shouldn’t say "the church," because the Church of Christ is always holy.  

Later, the big risk came when Christianity became the allowed religion, and then the official religion of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, and most Christian countries. This had both positive influences on those societies and the great risk of becoming too closely tied to the government, the nation, and worldly affairs. This is what harms us now. If you are too close to the nation, you may become more nationalistic than Christian, forgetting that your true homeland is in heaven, not on earth. Or you may become too dependent on the government rather than on Christ, and the government, in turn, becomes subdued by Mammon. This first happened in Western Europe, in former Christian countries and monarchies, but then it spread to Russia and Eastern Europe as well. I’m not talking about other countries here—they were hacked in other ways, and much more easily.  

Now, we are dealing with this problem: unless we remain spiritually vigilant every day, from morning till night, bearing the fruits of faith, we will be enslaved. We will be blinded.

We see how priests have been blinded. They became relaxed after the persecutions stopped more than 30 years ago, and these 30 years of relaxation have had a tremendous impact. We also see the faithful, who often don’t care deeply about their faith. Okay, we come to the church for two hours a week, but if you count how many hours there are in a week—seven days—that’s more than 100 hours. I’m not counting sleep and eating; it’s more than 100 hours, and only two of those hours are dedicated to God. Everything else is full immersion in Mammon. And with this, you think you won’t become a slave of Mammon? You think you won’t be blinded by Mammon? If you’re wasting your time during these other days and hours—playing stupid games, watching movies, or just killing time—you’re not just wasting time; you’re becoming completely blinded, mammonized. You’re becoming a mammonist.  

And I’m not just talking about regular faithful; I’m talking about priests as well. They, too, often spend hours in chat rooms, sharing links, videos, pictures—who knows what—just for entertainment, just because they have nothing else to do. Do you think such people won’t be blinded by propaganda, by bloggers, by influencers? Of course, they will be blinded, especially if it’s total blindness. Most people are blinded by some kind of media. As soon as you hear or see that many people—not just Christians, not just Orthodox, but many people—support a certain position, saying, “Yes, yes, yes, we like this guy, and the others are bad,” you should realize: this is a herd, and it’s rushing toward the precipice. Eventually, it will plunge into the sea and drown, as in the Gospel. We don’t want to be part of any herd; we want to follow only Christ, our true Shepherd.  

But this is becoming more and more difficult. External piety—going to church, lighting a candle, receiving Communion—everything seems fine. Then you go back to your Mammon, and everything feels peaceful and nice. You think, “I have peace of mind, I’m like everyone else, and that’s it.” But you *are* like everyone else—completely blinded. The peace you think you have is not the peace of the Lord; it’s the peace of the Antichrist. It’s spiritual death, a falling asleep, and you mistake it for peace.  

Brothers and sisters, we need to examine ourselves: Are we bearing fruits of faith? Are we free from false ideologies? Even when it comes to fruits of faith, some people say, “Oh, I helped someone, so now I’m happy; I’m good.” But Buddhists do the same, and many others do the same. Helping someone is better than walking away, of course, but it’s not enough. It doesn’t mean you can relax and say, “I’m a nice person; I’m bearing fruits of faith.” It’s not enough.  

Fasting has become more and more relaxed, with all kinds of justifications. Brothers and sisters, let us be vigilant. Let us put more effort into prayer. Let us not accuse anyone, but let us see that this world is dragging everyone into its net, including the Orthodox. We must be super vigilant to avoid this. We should not rely too much on someone else—on the official church position or on anything else. No, not anymore.

We have to be fighters ourselves. When the fortress has cracks, it now depends on every individual soldier—whether they are able to hold the enemy at bay and withstand the spirit of this world, which is overtaking the minds and hearts of everyone on this planet. May the Lord give us wisdom, give us spiritual vigilance, and give us hearts that are unceasingly striving for the truth, for His righteousness, and craving for the kingdom of heaven and its truth. May He make us ready to trample the devil at any time. With the mighty hand of our Lord, His wisdom, and His sacrificial love for others, we will prevail. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
