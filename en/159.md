# Should we care about health & longevity

Dear brothers and sisters, the last couple of videos were about the end of the world, but it may not come as soon as you expect. We need to be ready for it at any time, but we also need to be prepared if it takes another hundred years. So today, I want to talk about a more down-to-earth topic: the topic of health, because this also brings some spiritual concerns.

The most common problem we know is that people often don't care about their health—eating junk food, leading unhealthy lifestyles, and indulging in bad habits, among other things—just destroying our health. Increasingly, we have health-conscious people who care about what they eat, about exercising, about longevity, and other issues, which also brings some spiritual threats with it. If we make an idol of our body, of our health, how healthy we are, or how nice we look, with muscles or other attributes, this too becomes idolatry. So where is the golden balance? Where is the right approach?

Today, I want to talk about this because there is another problem: pseudo-spirituality, perhaps monophysite spirituality, which says we care about more important things, we care about spiritual matters, about prayer, about God, so why should we concern ourselves with health and such things? Some radical people fall into that kind of mistake, and perhaps it's better to fall into that kind of mistake than into idolatry. But in any case, as Saint Ambrose of Milan said, "If God is in the first place, everything else is in the right place."

So the first thing we need to say is that health is not the highest priority for a Christian, but it's not the least either. It is also important, and actually very important, but it's not as important as the spiritual life and the pursuit of God and His truth, which must obsess the heart of a Christian. How do I love Christ? What do I do? How do I reach His truth? What can I do to come closer to Him, to have a deeper repentance, to live His commandments, to have the heart of a Christian, loving and self-sacrificing? All these concerns are spiritual.

Having said that, we also recall that any sickness—well, not any sickness, but there is a relationship between sin and death. So many sicknesses that we have are actually the result of sin. Therefore, the first thing we have to do is to get rid of sin. And then we'll solve more than half of our health problems. Some things the doctors won't tell you. For example, we read the fifth commandment: "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you." Medicine won't tell you how this is connected. I mean, you obey your father and your mother, and you'll have a long life—this doesn't make sense to them. But for us, it does. We believe God more than we believe medicine. Because medicine knows something, and we don't challenge it, but it doesn't know many things yet.

So this is another dimension: the dimension of moral and spiritual life. Unless they are sound, anything else loses its meaning. If you are dirty inside but look nice, have big muscles, your soul—that doesn't make you nice in front of God. The soul is ugly and sick. So we need to clean first the heart, the soul. This is the first thing to do before we get really concerned about health matters.

Having said this, we need to find this balance. We cannot be superficial about what we're talking about now. So please have patience, bear with me. I will say more important things about this topic today. First of all, we have different kinds of callings for a Christian. For example, we have a calling to become a martyr. That means that there are things for which you can and should die if you are a Christian, if you love Christ.

And that means that there are things more important than your health and longevity. There are things for which you must be ready to die. You need to be prepared to die at any moment and to be joyful about it. If the Lord decides that now is the time for you to meet Him and be with Him, you must be ready for that and not avoid it. You should not fear death or even sickness. However, many people do not have this specific calling, and the Lord wants them to walk a different path—a path of many years, perhaps decades, of asceticism and ministry to Him. This is a daily martyrdom, where they serve Him and are His witnesses. He said, "You will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth." So they go, and we go, and we bear this testimony. And to do this, perhaps He wants you to continue for another hundred years—who knows? But if you are destroying your health now, you won’t be able to fulfill this calling for long. Therefore, we need to be prepared for that.

Both asceticism and ministry—whether it be missions, caring for a household, educating children, tending to family, or pursuing a career project—any form of ministry to the Lord requires health. Even when monks enter a monastery and are sick, there are not many expectations for great success in their spiritual life because they cannot engage in much prayer, prostrations, strict fasting, reading spiritual literature, or almost anything if their health is poor. Thus, your state of health directly influences what you can do for the Lord. There is a clear connection between your physical health and your spiritual capacity. 

Some Orthodox people say, "We just pray; we don’t care about what we eat, how we sleep, or any of these things. This is all nonsense." But then they may become overweight, fall ill, and die prematurely. This is another trick from the devil, who is a murderer and seeks to destroy people. By neglecting your health, you are following his lead, and this is pseudo-spirituality, not true spirituality. 

In the First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy, chapter 5, verse 23, Paul writes, "No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments." Here, we see that Timothy, a disciple of St. Paul, was relatively young but had poor health. He suffered from stomach problems and metabolic issues, which led to frequent illnesses. Paul knew this and advised Timothy to take care of his health. Timothy likely desired an ascetic life, as seen in the previous verse (22), which speaks of keeping oneself pure. A pure heart often involves ascetic practices, such as avoiding indulgence in tasty food and drink. Timothy may have been drinking only water, but Paul instructed him to add a little wine for his stomach's sake—not for enjoyment or a more pleasurable life, but for health. 

We see that Paul cared about health, and there is nothing wrong with that. Other Church Fathers have compared the body to a donkey or a horse that needs to be controlled with a bridle. Sometimes you tighten the reins, and sometimes you loosen them. You must control the body—sometimes giving it a little food, sometimes allowing it to abstain from sleep so that it does not collapse from exhaustion or lack of nourishment. However, it should not be indulged with everything it desires. 

In summary, while health is not the ultimate priority for a Christian, it is still important. We must find a balance, caring for our bodies so that we can serve the Lord effectively, whether through asceticism, ministry, or daily witness. Neglecting health under the guise of spirituality is a deception, and true spirituality involves stewardship of both body and soul.

So, we need to care about our health. What are the important aspects of health? Of course, what we eat and drink—our diet—is crucial. We should recognize that some foods are junk and avoid them. Exercise is important, as are vitamin supplements. We need a basic understanding of what is good for us and what we might be lacking. Monitoring our health, such as checking blood levels and other indicators, is also beneficial and nothing to shy away from. Sleep is another key factor—it should be neither too much nor too little. Our biological rhythm, or internal clock, should function well. Additionally, we must exercise our brains through reading, learning, and engaging in meaningful activities. All these things are important.

However, they should not become absolute values or obsessions. Think of your body as a car. The Lord has given you this "car" to use for good purposes. Of course, you need to maintain it and care for it. You cannot say, "The things I’m doing now are so important that I don’t have time to care for the car. I won’t change the oil or perform maintenance." That’s just an excuse. You need to take care of it—how you drive, where you drive, and how you maintain it. However, in an emergency, such as needing to rescue someone, you might drive fast or take the car off-road, even if it damages the car. The same applies to your body. Normal maintenance is essential, but there are times when you must prioritize a greater purpose over strict health routines.

We see this in the life of the Apostle Paul. He endured immense challenges—beatings, hunger, imprisonment, extreme heat, and cold. He didn’t say, "I can’t do this because it will disrupt my diet, my sleep, or my health routine." That would have been idolatry, selfishness, and narcissism. The greatest danger in caring too much about our health is that it can lead to selfishness and egoism. For example, in a fitness center, you often see people focused solely on themselves—their muscles, their exercises, their time. This self-centered mindset can easily take root when health becomes an obsession. Narcissism, such as constantly admiring your muscles in the mirror, removes God’s blessing from the pursuit of health.

Let us remember this: health is important, but it must not become an idol. As the Apostle Paul wrote in his letter to the Ephesians, "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we care for our health with the motivation of serving the Lord better—so that our minds are sharper, our bodies stronger, and our prayers longer—then our efforts will be blessed. If our goal is to help more people for a longer time, this mindset will bring God’s blessing.

On the other hand, if we focus solely on external appearances—having a healthy, nice-looking body while neglecting the beauty of our hearts—we miss the point. The kingdom of God is supposed to reside in our hearts. If we can cultivate inner beauty and holiness, then our external appearance, whether healthy or not, will reflect God’s glory more authentically. A healthy body that serves God’s purposes glorifies Him far more than a body that is merely strong or attractive but lacks spiritual depth. 

In summary, care for your health, but do so with the right motivation—to serve God and others better. Avoid selfishness and narcissism, and remember that true beauty begins in the heart. Let your health and your body be tools for glorifying God in all that you do.

God did not create us to be fat and sick; He created us to be healthy and capable of doing many positive things. Of course, He wants us to be strong, healthy, and able to fulfill His purposes. A healthy life glorifies God, but it is not as important as the state of your soul. I’ll come back to this point: you must begin with your soul. 

This leads us to another important question. All the things I’ve mentioned about caring for our health—diet, exercise, sleep, mental activity—require strong willpower and a clear mind to understand health-related matters. Yet, very often, we lack these. We may start with good intentions, but our will falters, or we lack the knowledge to make the right choices. We might even harm ourselves by doing the wrong things. To address this, the first step is to seek union with the Lord. This union comes through confessing our sins and receiving Holy Communion. When the Lord enters us through Communion, He destroys the sting of sin and death within us, healing our hearts and strengthening our will. This enables us to do more for Him. 

When we receive Holy Communion, we pray for the healing of both soul and body. The healing of the soul is more important, but the body is also included. We must heal our souls to effectively care for our bodies. Without this spiritual foundation, our efforts will fall short. We may know we should exercise or eat well, but without motivation or discipline, we fail. Only through the Lord’s blessing and healing can we find the strength and clarity to care for our health properly. 

Let us remember this: we need a balanced approach to health, guided by wisdom, so that our pursuit of health does not undermine our love for Christ. We must avoid turning health consciousness into a new-age religion, where yoga, veganism, or other practices become egoistic obsessions. Such a mindset is rooted in fear of death and a desire to cling to this life, which is fundamentally pagan and anti-Christian. We must not fall into this trap. 

May the Lord grant you strong health, heal your soul, and help you glorify Him through your ministry, asceticism, and daily life. We can use the technologies and knowledge available to us—even if they were developed for selfish purposes—for God’s glory and to serve Him more effectively. 

One final point: some people mistakenly believe that everything about their lifespan is predetermined, and that trying to extend their life is challenging God’s will. This is a lie. The Lord has given us great freedom and responsibility over our lives. Just as we have the freedom to harm ourselves, we also have the freedom to make choices that promote health and avoid sickness. By choosing to eat well, exercise, and live a healthy lifestyle, we are not challenging God’s will but stewarding the life He has given us. 

In conclusion, care for your health, but always begin with your soul. Seek union with the Lord, confess your sins, and receive His healing through Holy Communion. With His blessing, you can care for your body in a way that glorifies Him and enables you to serve Him more fully. God bless you.

The Lord knows everything—whether someone will commit suicide, whether you will take care of your health and live longer, or neglect it and die earlier. He knows all these things, but this does not mean He removes our freedom. We have been given the freedom to make choices, and we can influence even how long we live through the decisions we make. Of course, this must be done with the Lord’s blessing and for His glory, not for selfish or egotistical purposes. 

May the Lord grant you health, wisdom, and the discernment to navigate this new world that is emerging—a world where many false values will be proclaimed, especially regarding health consciousness and other areas. These values will often be fake and anti-Christian, but we must filter out what comes from the Lord and what comes from the spirit of the Antichrist. 

May the Lord help you, guide you, and bless you as you strive to live a life that glorifies Him, cares for your health, and remains steadfast in the truth. Amen.
