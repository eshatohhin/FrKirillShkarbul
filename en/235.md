# THE NEW YEAR Annum Domini or Advance of the Enemy

Dear brothers and sisters, we are entering the New Year, and for us, of course, the calendar is not that important—this worldly calendar. But for us, what is important is that the Lord is giving us more time. This is a good opportunity to reflect on the significance of counting years after the coming of the Lord into this world. Even though there may be a discrepancy of a few years, the essence remains that we live in this era of the Messiah, after the birth of Christ. This new era is the era of salvation, where everyone is invited to enter into the Kingdom of the Lord, to partake in the feast that is already underway. We already participate in this feast, but an even greater participation is yet to come. It is already here, but not yet fully realized. We are already becoming children of the Kingdom of Heaven, and this is the meaning of our existence, the reason why the world continues. 

This New Year reminds us that the Lord still has patience, that He still sees purpose in this world and in the life of each one of us. As we look back on the past year, we see that many did not make it. There were wars, pandemics, and millions who died from drug overdoses—not to mention suicides and other tragic deaths that go against the will of God, especially when people kill one another intentionally. The Lord allows these things to happen, though they are against His will, particularly when people die in sin without the chance to repent. Much of this is due to us—those who have discovered the Lord, His Kingdom, and His calling—yet have not done enough to share the Gospel, to testify, to show others that there is a way out, that the Lord is real. Even the worst sinner can be redeemed and, by grace, become godly. Yet, many die believing there is no hope, immersed in sin and unable to find a way out. 

This is something I hope we can reflect on deeply. Another aspect to consider is our spiritual life, which is closely tied to this, as the lack of our testimony stems from a lack of union with Christ, from not allowing Him to live in us and His Kingdom to dwell within us. We are still caught up in the turmoil of this world, immersed in secular life, passions, events, fears, and everything happening around us. We remain too attached to these things, but we must learn to live by the Spirit. Only by stepping back from this chaos can we gain clarity and spiritual insight—not only into our own struggles but also into the problems of the world. This is another important goal we must set: to reevaluate and renew our spiritual lives. 

We also take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Lord for everything that has happened over the past year. We must acknowledge that we have not thanked Him as we should, especially for the sorrows and pains we endured. We often fail to thank God even for the good things. Now is the time to make up for this lack of thanksgiving, to express our gratitude, particularly for the pain. Sorrows are our teachers, often a visitation from the Lord, reminding us that there is still hope for improvement, for change, and for learning. Through sorrow, we can learn repentance, compassion, selflessness, and true prayer from the heart. We can gain spiritual discipline and wisdom from the trials we endure.

And now, having reflected on the year that is passing, let us turn our thoughts to the year ahead. For us, the idea of progress—that everything is improving and moving toward a brighter future—does not hold. We know that this world has an end, and with each passing year, we draw closer to that conclusion. Whether it happens in the year 2000-something or 3000-something, it will come. Now, as we enter 2024, we take another step closer. Let us think of it this way.

What can we expect? First, I must clarify that I am not a political advisor or an economic analyst. When I speak of worldly matters, it is only to share general observations and to encourage us not to become entangled in them but to remain prepared for whatever may come. In this sense, I can say that the new year may bring what secular analysts predict—essentially, the agenda of the prince of this world. This agenda is nothing new, but we can see the direction it is taking. The world is drifting toward greater chaos, division, and control over human freedoms, thoughts, and consciences. There will be more polarization, more totalitarian governments, stricter laws, and greater control over trade and personal lives. The agenda of depopulation will continue through war, famine, sickness, and other means. Digitalization will increase, with every transaction and thought monitored. Poverty will rise, the middle class will shrink, and many other challenges will emerge.

For a Christian, the response to these developments is not fear, escape, or stockpiling supplies. Instead, the answer lies in nurturing our inner world. What does it mean to pray from the heart? How do we guard our hearts and cultivate our minds in Christ? How do we attain the peace of the Lord in our souls? This must be our ultimate daily goal. Many of us lack this peace. We are swayed by emotions, news, job problems, family matters, and earthly concerns. We are still fleshly, but we must strive to be guided by the Holy Spirit. This is the goal we must set for ourselves.

The Jesus Prayer is a powerful tool in this journey. Through prayer, we learn repentance, engage in dialogue with the Lord, and nurture virtues. We grow in Christ and become anchors of salvation for ourselves and those around us. This is what truly matters; everything else is relative. We must set this goal for the new year: vigilance. We must admit that we lack vigilance. Many of us are spiritually asleep or constantly drifting in and out of wakefulness. This is the reality for most of us. Let us wake up. Let us learn what it means to live every moment in the presence of the Lord, to maintain a dialogue with Him wherever we are. Prayer must become as natural as breathing, a spiritual need of our hearts. This must become a reality for each of us.

May the Lord guide us on this path. May He help us escape every delusion, even spiritual delusion. May we grow in vigilance, prayer, and union with Christ, so that we may face the challenges of the coming year with faith, hope, and peace.

Every hit, whether from the left or the right, is not political. From the left, it is something bad—an attempt to pull us into outright evil. From the right, it may seem good—thoughts like "pray more" or "help this person." But these can also be deceptive. They are fake because they come at the wrong time or lead us into other passions, such as vainglory or pride. Sometimes, the devil disguises his tricks as seemingly good thoughts. We must gain the wisdom and discernment to recognize these plots and schemes of the adversary. We must uproot the leviathan of our old self, kill it, and crucify it. Otherwise, we will become propagators of evil—and in many ways, we already are. But with the Lord's help, we can change this.

May the Lord bless us in the upcoming year. May He prepare our hearts for His coming during the holy Christmas season, which is near. May He set us firmly on the path of salvation. We must also learn temperance—a great virtue. A few things are enough, and this simplicity will serve us well when times grow harder. We will need patience to endure whatever comes our way—physical, spiritual, or psychological pain, loneliness, or fears. We must be able to persevere, no matter how long the suffering lasts. May the Lord grant us the courage and decisiveness to follow Him, to carry our cross, and to be good witnesses of His love, humility, and compassion for every human soul.

May the Lord help each of us and bless us in the upcoming year. Happy New Year.
