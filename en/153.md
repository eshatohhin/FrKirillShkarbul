# If global hunger is coming, how should Christians prepare

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
We are coming to the end of the Paschal season. Next Thursday, we will celebrate the Ascension of the Lord, and after that, I will no longer be wearing the red vestments. These are our final days in this joyful celebration of the Living Christ being with us.  

As we approach the end of this season, we also find ourselves reflecting more and more on what is happening in the world today. The current events are driving many people to despair and fear. How we respond to these fears or dangers reveals the depth of our Christian faith. Often, we receive the faith, but our hearts and minds remain unchanged from what they were before. It is like a house that needs cleaning—every corner must be addressed.  

Now, people are talking about the possibility of widespread hunger, which some associate with the third horseman of the apocalypse. The first is plague, the second is war, the third is hunger, and the fourth is death. There are concerns about food supply shortages, with predictions that the situation could worsen by October or November of this year. Many are afraid of this prospect.  

One question is whether this is possible and how severe the danger might be. Another, more important question is how we, as Christians, should respond and prepare for such challenges.  

First, let me share my own experiences with food shortages. I have lived through three major periods of food scarcity. It’s important to note that a food shortage is not the same as famine, though we might use the term "hunger" loosely.  

The first experience was during the Soviet era in the 1980s. At that time, stores were nearly empty. You could walk into a supermarket and find only dried bread. Even that was considered a luxury—if you could buy it, you were fortunate. There was no meat, no dairy, almost nothing. To buy meat or sausages, you might have to travel by train for three hours to Moscow, hoping to find something there.  

Such extreme shortages are unlikely to occur in developed countries today, though they might still happen in former socialist or Soviet bloc nations, or in authoritarian regimes like China. In developed capitalist countries, the risk is minimal. Even in former Soviet bloc countries, the situation would be different now. Back then, everyone had some money and equal opportunities. Today, some people might have no money, no job, and no means to buy food, leaving them in dire straits.  

During the Soviet era, ration cards were used to distribute food. You could exchange these cards for rice or sugar. However, the government also used these cards to control the population. In the 1920s and 1930s, certain groups, such as the aristocracy or clergy, were denied ration cards, effectively condemning them to starvation.  

Today, with electronic tracking, such control could be even more precise. If someone tries to share food secretly, it could be traced, and they could be punished. In such a scenario, we might face even greater challenges than in the past. Moreover, fewer people today might be willing to share their last resources with those in need.  

As Christians, we must reflect on how we respond to such fears and challenges. Our faith calls us to trust in God’s providence, to care for one another, and to remain steadfast in hope, even in the face of uncertainty. Let us use this time to deepen our faith and prepare our hearts to act with compassion and courage, no matter what the future holds.

At that time, things were different, but such scenarios are still quite possible today.  

Now, returning to reality, the other two types of food shortages I witnessed occurred in the Philippines and East Timor. In the Philippines, I saw children and refugees displaced by natural disasters like tsunamis or hurricanes, or by conflicts and wars. They moved from one region to another, often without stable jobs or the ability to grow their own crops. For adults, the lack of food was challenging, but for children, it was devastating. If children do not eat enough every day, they become sick and may die prematurely. Such situations are still possible in third-world countries, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, and could happen this year or next.  

In East Timor, our Orthodox mission experienced food shortages during the early days of the pandemic two years ago. People were unable to travel, buy rice, or work their fields. Prices skyrocketed, and many struggled to afford even basic necessities. These were difficult times, and the situation could worsen in similar regions. However, if you do not live in such a country, you likely do not need to worry about personally experiencing such extreme shortages.  

Some people respond to these fears by stockpiling supplies. They buy enough food to last six months or more, storing grains, canned goods, and other preserved items. Others consider moving to a farm, growing their own crops, and avoiding the urban environment, which they see as increasingly anti-Christian and controlling. Both approaches need to be examined.  

The first solution—hoarding supplies—is not a Christian way of facing the problem. As Christians, we pray daily, "Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." We trust that God will provide. Hoarding food while others starve is selfish and reflects a lack of faith in God. It is not a Christian response.  

If we are truly Christian, we must care for others, especially in times of crisis. Instead of sitting at home with our stockpiles, we should think about how we can help those in need. For example, we could connect with farmers who sell directly to consumers, bypassing supermarket chains, and distribute food to those who cannot afford it. Organizing such efforts with a team of like-minded individuals is a far more Christian approach than isolating ourselves with our reserves.  

The second solution—moving to a farm or rural area—is a more complex topic that deserves careful consideration. While it may seem like a way to escape societal problems, it is not a decision to be made lightly.  

In summary, as Christians, we must prioritize faith, compassion, and community over self-preservation. If a crisis arises, we should think of others first, not ourselves. Many of us, myself included, have struggled with selfish mindsets in the past, but we must strive to align our actions with our faith. This is the Christian way of facing challenges.

But let me clarify one thing. There are two types of motivations for moving to a rural or isolated setting.  

The first motivation is to escape—to flee from what is perceived as a dangerous, corrupt world and to create a safe haven for oneself. This mindset is driven by a desire for personal safety, self-sufficiency, and freedom from external control, such as electronic surveillance or societal pressures. However, this motivation is flawed. If your primary goal is to escape, you will likely find that rural life is far more challenging than you imagined. You will have to limit your lifestyle drastically—what you eat, what you do, and how you live. You will lose many conveniences and comforts that modern life provides. Moreover, your inner struggles—your passions, anger, lust, depression, or stress—will not disappear simply because you change your environment. In fact, they may become more pronounced. This kind of motivation is not sustainable and will ultimately fail.  

The second motivation, which is far rarer, is rooted in a deep love for Christ. Those with this motivation seek to dedicate their entire lives to prayer, fasting, and spiritual growth. They are drawn to a simpler, more ascetic life not to escape the world but to be closer to Christ. They work hard every day, not for themselves but for Him. Their desire is not to run away but to live in constant communion with Christ. This is a noble and holy motivation, but it is also very rare. Most of us do not have this level of spiritual maturity, which is why we must carefully examine our reasons for considering such a drastic change.  

Now, let’s consider whether the potential arrival of the third horseman—hunger—is a good or bad thing. For Christians, it could actually be beneficial. It might teach us to live more simply, to care less about indulging in rich or varied foods, and to focus more on spiritual nourishment. We could learn to fast more deeply and to find joy in a simpler, less materialistic way of life. In this sense, food shortages or higher prices could serve as a spiritual wake-up call, helping us detach from worldly concerns and grow closer to God.  

However, for the broader, non-Christian society, such a scenario could lead to stricter control and manipulation. Governments might use food shortages as a tool to enforce a new world order, promoting alternative food sources like insects or lab-grown products. Social rating systems and universal basic income could be introduced, further reducing individual freedoms and turning people into compliant, controlled entities. This would not be a positive development, as it would strip society of its dignity and autonomy, reducing people to the level of animals who know their place and obey without question.  

In such times, it is crucial for us as Christians to remain spiritually strong, rooted in Christ, and focused on caring for others rather than ourselves. If we trust in the Lord, if we are selfless, brave, and compassionate, He will provide for our needs. Let us not be driven by fear or selfishness but by faith and love, knowing that Christ is with us in every trial.

The Lord will help us to overcome any situation, no matter how difficult it may be. He will guide us through every challenge, providing us with the strength, wisdom, and clarity we need to not only survive but also to help others.  

May the Lord fill our hearts with His joy, strengthen our faith, and grant us the courage to face whatever lies ahead. Let us hold fast to the joy of His resurrection, for Christ is truly risen—indeed, He is risen!  

Christ is risen! Truly, He is risen!
