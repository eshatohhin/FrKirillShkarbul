# Our World view and Soul are shaped by Cain What can we do

Dear brothers and sisters, last time I spoke about idolatry and the forms it takes in our modern world, especially in countries that are not pagan but were once Christian, atheist, or something else.  
All kinds of idolatry exist.  
I should have emphasized that the most common form of idolatry today is the idolization of family—when our relatives become idols, and we become idols for them.  
It often takes the shape of love, but very frequently, it is deeply selfish. We can see the true nature of this love when it encounters the Christian message, the truth.  
Very often, it becomes hostile. I know instances where a mother cursed her daughter for wanting to become a nun, even saying, "I'd rather have you become a prostitute, a harlot, than go to the monastery."  
Can you see the madness here?  
What kind of love is this?  
This is self-love.  
You believe that your child is your possession, and they must conform to your desires.  
There are many forms of idol worship in our modern world, and we must recognize that we ourselves are idol worshippers, even if it sounds bizarre to you.  
This is the starting point.  
If we want to escape this self-deception, this is something we must acknowledge and understand.  

Today, I want to discuss why this happens and what the world truly looks like in reality.  
There are three common mindsets we see in the world today.  

The first is the consumer mindset.  
It goes something like this:  
"The world is complicated, but I don’t care. I care about my salary, the simple pleasures I can buy with it, and that’s it. This is my world, and I don’t care about anything else."  
This is a very simple, consumerist, slave-like mindset.  
It’s the mindset of mass culture, mass people—not mass society.  

The second mindset is similar. It says:  
"Well, I want to know what’s happening in the world. It’s not that difficult because I watch analysts, bloggers, and news outlets like BBC or CNN, and they tell me what’s going on.  
I know Iran has a nuclear program. I know this and that. It’s not complicated. I know what’s happening in the world, but I don’t really care too much because I mainly care about my savings, my salary, my purchases, and my enjoyment—my little paradise, so to speak.  
Sometimes it’s a hell, but this is what I care about. I don’t care about anything else.  
Well, maybe I care a little because the TV says I should care about who wins the U.S. elections and other things."  

The third mindset is more intellectual and truly agnostic. All three are agnostic, but this one is the most pronounced.  
It says:  
"I am the smartest. I have education and intellectual ability. I know everything. I can analyze who is saying what, but I’m smarter. I can read between the lines and understand everything better than anyone else.  
I’m fine. I don’t need to repent much."  
This is the mindset of the so-called elite—though it’s not a real elite. It’s a pseudo-elite.  
This is the mindset of many people in positions of influence, those who are not part of the mass population.  
Yet, they are also slaves to a paradigm, completely blinded. They have even more idols—idols of freedom, human rights, financial stability, and so on.  
They are big-time idol worshippers, but they think they are enlightened.  
I have a video on enlightenment that you can watch.  
Of course, some of these mindsets are projected onto the rest of the population, and many ordinary people think similarly.

Because all three mindsets are agnostic, they share one thing in common: none of them involve repentance.  
All three lack repentance.  
Of course, I’m simplifying things here—it’s more complicated—but I’m generalizing to make a point.  

Now, let’s say we want to move away from these mindsets.  
The first step would be to at least acknowledge that I don’t know everything. The world is much more complicated than it seems.  
Maybe there’s a conspiracy, maybe there’s this or that. I don’t really know, but I want to know.  
I want to understand. I try to search, I try to discover. I don’t believe everything I hear.  
This is the first step, but it’s still self-reliant.  
The person thinks they can free themselves from the deceptions that prevail in this world, think outside the box, and find answers on their own.  
This mindset has a basic humility—the person acknowledges that they are not omnipotent and don’t know everything.  
They also have the good characteristic of seeking truth, of not just saying, “Oh, let it be, I don’t care.”  
These qualities might help them progress to another stage: the Christian attitude toward the world.  

At this stage, the mindset becomes:  
“I am a sinner. I cannot do this on my own. I do want to understand what the world is.”  
This is normal and natural for people. We are meant to understand the world because it was created for us to be its stewards.  
That’s how God designed it. Originally, humanity was created for this purpose.  
So, it’s normal for a person to want to understand the world, and it’s a perversion to become one of those ignorant people who don’t care.  
The natural, healthy way of looking at the world is to say, “I do want to know what’s going on and what it’s all about.  
I want to see my place in this world, my mission, and I need to understand that I myself need salvation.  
I need to be with God to understand and accomplish this mission.”  
This humility and repentance must always accompany us.  
This is the mindset we are seeking.  

I wanted to share this thought with you.  
Recently, I was in a large church with many people, including children.  
I could see a big question mark in the eyes of these children.  
They are facing a world they don’t understand, and they are afraid of it.  
They are not afraid of the church, but neither their parents nor the priest can answer all their questions.  
Maybe they don’t even know what to ask.  
They look at the altar, they look at the saints, and they are seeking help.  
It is our responsibility to warn them of the dangers that exist in this world.  
As adults, we have already experienced much of the evil in the world.  
We have wounds, and we’ve fallen into traps. But these children have not yet experienced these things, and they will fall into traps—perhaps even worse ones—if we don’t warn them.  

The problem is that with our gnostic mindset, we cannot give them a true picture of the world.  
We cannot warn them of everything.  
We cannot guard them—only God can do that. But we can play a significant role in helping them avoid these dangers.  
To do that, however, we first need to thoroughly revise our own character and our understanding of the world.  

This is what my video is about this time.  
Where do we begin?  
The first step is to acknowledge that the worldview I have is wrong, and the character I have is wrong.  
By “wrong,” I mean that these things are shaped by the world of Cain or Leviathan—the world of those who have rejected God.  
It’s not just about sin; it’s about the spirit of Cain, who doesn’t want God’s healing or mercy and becomes an enemy of God.

And in the future, I will say more about Cain—this path to destruction, to Abaddon, to the abyss, to Gehenna, if you will. This is the path of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  
We have lived in this world, shaped by Cain’s spirit, for almost all our lives.  
Then, we repented and decided to become Christians, striving for heaven and a holy life.  
But while our *nous* (in Greek, the spiritual mind or intellect) has seen God’s grace and mercy and directed us toward this goal, everything else within us—our memories, values, logic, emotions, and feelings—remains in the old paradigm formed during our life in Cain’s world.  

Now, we need to be driven by the Spirit to break free from these shackles.  
Too often, people don’t do this. They think, “Now that I’m a Christian, I go to church, so everything should be better. I should be like the saints.”  
But we discover we’re not. We fail repeatedly. Every confession, we confess the same sins, and it seems to get worse.  
We don’t understand why. We say, “Maybe this isn’t for me. It’s for the saints, but I can’t do it.”  
And so, people give up and are dragged back into apostasy, back into the life of hell.  

How do we avoid this?  
Let me give you an analogy.  
We live in a modern city, accustomed to comfort, convenience, transportation, air conditioning, a full refrigerator, and endless choices at the supermarket.  
We’re used to this way of life.  
But when we become Christians and think deeply about this paradigm—this union of people without God, this Babylon of mutual benefit, efficiency, and pleasure-seeking without God—we realize its core values and logic are designed to make us live in apostasy.  
As Christians, we understand this, but are we ready to cut ties with this civilization?  
Are we ready to live in a cave in the desert, praying day and night, or to serve the sick in Africa without air conditioning, a refrigerator, or even a toilet?  
Such actions would please God and draw us closer to Him.  
But are we ready?  
Most of us are not.  
We stay in the city, and slowly, we are reprogrammed—dragged back into the same mindset as our idol-worshipping relatives.  
We, too, become idol worshippers, thinking, “Now I’m a Christian, but I’m still an idol worshipper.”  
This is the essence of worldliness.  

What do we do?  
I’m not saying everyone should go to the desert right now—after all, I’m not in the desert myself.  
The first step is to acknowledge that my worldview is wrong—it’s shaped by Cain and Leviathan.  
My character is also a product of Cain and Leviathan.  
I need to work daily to break these shackles, to gain autonomy from everything that makes me complacent, apostate, and reliant on worldly comforts.  
This includes not being overly dependent on YouTube, news, or endless chats.  
Our hearts should already be in the kingdom of heaven, even as we remain here.

We are still here, but our hearts must be in the kingdom of heaven.  
How do we achieve this?  
Without asceticism, without hesychasm (the prayer of the heart), and without an active life in the Church—especially through the sacraments of holy confession and the holy Eucharist—we cannot avoid worldliness and the blindness of thinking we are Christians while still being idol-worshippers, or even sons of the devil, as some Jews became in the time of Christ.  

This is what I wanted to share today: how do we do this?  
I will say more in future videos, but the first step is to understand what is happening within us and in the world.  
We must recognize the spirit of Cain and the modern idolatry that surrounds us, both within and without.  
We must strive to break the "glasses" that Cain has placed on us, which have become stuck to our faces.  

Let us see this problem clearly.  
Let us have deep repentance, always acknowledging that we are still lacking, that we are still far from Christ.  
We need to change, to break these shackles every day so that the seed of God’s Word can grow within us, bear fruit, and lead us to holiness.  
We must become His witnesses, transformed day by day by His love.  

May the Lord’s grace, wisdom, and strength be with each of you, helping us to be victorious and to break all the shackles that still enslave us from every side.  
May the Lord help us and grant us peace and blessing.  
Amen.
