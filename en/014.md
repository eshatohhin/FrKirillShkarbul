# Why do we have so few real friends

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about friendship and why it is so difficult for us to make friends, to have new friends. Most of us have maybe one or two friends at most. Many people don't have any friends at all. If you have more real friends, that's an amazing blessing because even one friend is a precious gift from God, and we need to preserve them as much as we can. Most of the friends we have are from childhood or from our college or university years. Very rarely do we have real, good friends from later times in our lives, and there are several reasons for that. Today, we're going to talk about this and why and how it is related to our faith.

One important reason is that as we grow, we develop a false perception of self-importance. We think, "I am very important myself," and this is why if somebody doesn't recognize this importance, we don't want to communicate with them. A friend would know your weaknesses; they would know you through and through, and you would not be able to maintain the image you want to present to everyone—that you are some great phenomenon or successful person. A real friend would know about all the ways you're not that successful and many other things. We don't want anyone to know these things, and this is why we don't allow people into our lives. We have all these barriers, and we install more and more of them.

Another reason is that as we grow older, we accumulate more assets—not necessarily property, but maybe properties too, like real estate, cars, and stuff. We also accumulate diplomas, work experience, career development, and many other things. We perceive these as a big part of ourselves—this is "big me," okay? And this is my property, my asset; it belongs to me, and I don't want to share it with anyone else. If somebody is my friend, it's like I'm letting them into my house to use whatever I have here for their own purposes, and we don't want that. We become very stingy and very much attached to all that stuff, thinking that this is mine, even though we don't take it anywhere after we die. But we still have that false impression, that false perception, that this is my stuff, and I'm afraid to lose it or share it with anyone. It's like giving it freely away, but it's been accumulated with a lot of labor, a lot of suffering, and this is my thing. We can see how far this mindset is from Christ's commandments, but we still are like that—all of us.

Another reason is that we begin to value personal benefit. If somebody can benefit me, okay, I will use them. I will accept that relationship, but I will help someone else with the aim that they might give some benefit to me in return. For example, some people say, "All my neighbors are my friends," but this is basically because you help them so that they can help you out too, or so they don’t create problems for you. This is why you’re sort of friends with them, but it’s not real friendship—it’s just convenience, mutual benefit, or maybe a partnership. 

Sometimes we think, "Okay, the person with whom I play tennis or golf or something else is my friend," but they’re not really your friend. You’re both friends with the tennis, golf, or some other hobby, but it’s not a friendship between the two of you. It’s a friendship with something else, mainly, and for you, it’s just convenience. So, we need to be honest with ourselves and not fool ourselves into thinking that this is some kind of friendship. It might grow into a friendship, but most of the time, it doesn’t.

Another big reason why this happens is that, over time, we accumulate more and more negative experiences with people. Some people betray us, others use or cheat us, and we begin to expect that from anyone. As a result, we become more critical and cautious, keeping our distance from others to avoid being harmed too much. This is why we don’t let people get too close—into our homes or into our hearts. It’s another big problem. We’re not as naive anymore; we’re suspicious, and these qualities are also what Christ is against. He tells us to be like children—pure, simple, and open-hearted. Don’t worry so much. If God is with you, even if someone harms or betrays you, that suffering will make you stronger and bring you closer to Christ. You will suffer in the same way Christ suffered. So, don’t always be so conservative, so afraid, and so suspicious of everyone. Be reasonable, of course, but don’t let that turn into fear or suspicion of everyone and everything. 

We shouldn’t be afraid of risk, problems, or burdens. Some people think, "If someone becomes my friend, they’ll bring their own problems into my life. I already have enough of my own problems, and now I’ll have to help them with theirs too. It’s just too much. I don’t want anyone else’s troubles to become my troubles." This mindset shows how we’re becoming more selfish and self-oriented, building walls around ourselves like a castle. This is similar to what I mentioned in a previous video about the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven—how sins enter the human heart, closing its gates from the inside and not letting anyone in. 

With Christ, we can be healthy and strong, not so easily hurt or damaged by others. We can withstand all kinds of suffering and pain that might come our way. We are walking on water; we’re not trying to insure ourselves against all troubles. This is what faith can give us. 

Another big reason why this happens is that, over time, we become more self-confident in the sense that we think, "I already know everything. I’m not interested in learning from someone else’s experience. I have my own experience, my own judgment. I basically know everything." We’re only curious about gossip or bad news, but we’re not interested in serious, valuable things. If someone suggests reading classics or important works, we think, "I know everything about that. It’s not relevant to me anymore." This is another consequence of living without God. Our mindset becomes narrower, and we only care about what’s right in front of us. 

But any friendship or relationship is like a small church—a school where we learn from each other. We truly learn from each other’s experiences, and we bear each other’s burdens. We participate, have compassion, and share in both joy and sorrow. It is actually a Christian virtue to have real friendship with someone. Friendship is always a sacrifice—we sacrifice our hearts and our time for someone else. Modern people, however, don’t want to sacrifice; they want to gain and receive, not give. This is another big problem. Only Christ can truly change us and make us different.

Okay, He can truly change this in us because, on our own, we are like that—and we only get worse. We become very selfish, insisting, "If someone else wants something done differently, no, I want it my way. I want to do what I want." This is also why we lack friendship, and it’s why families break up. Husbands and wives should be real friends, but without Christ’s blessing, without Him in us healing us and guarding us from the spirit of the world and our own fallen nature, this is absent from people’s lives. We don’t let Him in. 

It is only the Lord who can help us. We have fixed ideas; we don’t want to receive others’ ideas, including political ones. "This is the way I see it," we say, and in everything else, we become more and more narrow-minded. We think we are free, but in reality, we become slaves to our own nature and mindset. We become stupid, thinking we’re smart, but we’re not. It is with Christ that we gain real wisdom, broadness of mind, and freedom in spirit. With Him, we can see wisdom in everybody’s position, learn much more, and be like children, as the Lord says. A child is always learning, always interested in grasping something new, and this is how we should be—even though we’ve grown up, we can still be like that with the grace and blessing of God. 

So, let us not be afraid of the responsibilities that real friendship brings. Let us ask Christ to open our hearts, which are closed, sealed, and glued shut. Let Him break through and make us unafraid of stepping out in faith. The way of faith is walking on water, and we must be ready to walk on water, to be open to others, to receive them into our lives and hearts, and to participate in their lives—mainly to help and support them. 

May God bless us and give us this loving, Christian heart—despite our age, our experience, or our past. Let us forgive everyone, forget our grudges, and hold no bitterness toward others or our lives. Let us become more open, friendly, and supportive of the people around us. You will see that there will be others like that, and we will have real friends. Even if we don’t, remember that Christ Himself came to His own people, but they did not receive Him. Yet, it was still worth coming. It wasn’t a failure. So, if we don’t get anything back, let’s not expect it or be upset or discouraged. 

May Christ give us this heart, His blessing, and His mind. God bless.
