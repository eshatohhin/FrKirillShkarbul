# Mission on the Tubuai Island

Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm on the Austral Islands, specifically the island of Tubuai. Today marks the first day that I have achieved mission success. This accomplishment has inspired me to record this video because, without any mission success, you don't really feel compelled to record videos, you know? Otherwise, it just feels like being a tour guide, simply saying, "OK, I came here as a tourist. I saw this, I did that." And that kind of content is, in my view, somewhat pointless because, while some young people might enjoy sharing where they've been and what they've done, for me, the goal is to preach the gospel.

So, my focus during all these days since my arrival in Polynesia has been on the real mission: what can I do to truly develop the mission here? When you're focused on something like this, you don't really have the time or the drive to record every little detail, like "OK, this is this, this is that," because that's not the point. If the entire mission were a failure—if you came and achieved nothing—then all these videos would be pointless, right? That's why this is the first video I'm recording in more detail.

Today, I want to talk not about the success that I have achieved—because, well, it's not just me; many people have contributed to this, and it's the Lord who made it happen. It doesn't come from us. I've been telling everyone that without a special providence, a special miracle from the Lord, we wouldn't be able to accomplish anything here. It just wouldn't work. But today, I feel that the Lord has performed that miracle. I will share more about this in one of my subsequent videos.

Today, I want to share with you what Polynesia is all about—the people, the culture, at least the overall impression. I can't tell you everything, of course, but I can share what I've seen, why I came here, and specifically, why I came to this island of Tubuai.

First of all, I didn't know much about Polynesia before coming here. For me, Polynesia was just some dots on the map in the Pacific Ocean. I had heard about Tahiti, of course—Tahiti, Tahiti—but I didn't really know what it was like, to be honest. I thought it might be less developed because it's so far away. After all, further out, you only have Easter Island, close to Argentina and Chile in South America, which is almost uninhabited. So, this is one of the populated places that is further away from everything else in Oceania. I thought it might not be very developed, but I was wrong.

When I arrived in Tahiti, I found it to be almost like a part of France or the United States—a mix of the two, perhaps similar to Hawaii. It's like a small version of France because you see Europeans everywhere, and everyone speaks French. There are high-end boutique shops, organic stores, you name it. You have everything there—well, not everything, but it's not like some remote, underdeveloped island. It's far away geographically, but it's highly developed and very much oriented toward tourism.

So, more than half of the people in Papeete—that's the capital, pronounced in French as Papeete—are non-locals. Well, maybe some of them were born in Tahiti, but they are not Polynesians; they are white, descendants of Europeans—French, British, German, all kinds of nationalities—but they were born in Tahiti. So, to be honest, you don't really feel like you're in Polynesia when you're in Papeete. There are traffic jams, and it doesn't feel like a remote place. It's very saturated; the people there have seen it all. They've seen missionaries, preachers from all over the world, all kinds of sects and religions coming to do their missions. As a result, people don't really care. Their overall attitude is indifference. They care about shopping, eating, and making money. So, you need a different strategy to do mission work in Tahiti. You need to live there for many years, develop relationships with people, and slowly let them learn who you are, what you preach, and what makes you different. You make friends gradually, like in Taiwan or the Mariana Islands. It's not like in Timor-Leste or Papua New Guinea, where you might see 1,000 people wanting to convert right away. It doesn't work that way here.

After doing mission work in Papeete for a few days, I realized it wasn't working as I had hoped. So, I went to another place—I shared a video with a view of Moorea Island. I went around the island, and it's pretty much as developed as Tahiti, maybe just a little less busy, but still very developed. I had the same feeling there as I did in Papeete. I came back and thought, "Well, maybe I need to try another place." The next day, a lady took me around the island of Tahiti by car, so I saw the whole island, including a smaller part called Tahiti Iti (Little Tahiti). We went everywhere, and I saw tourists and commercialization everywhere. The feeling was that, yes, we need to do mission work here, but it's not going to happen quickly.

I felt that maybe I needed to go to at least one other remote island in French Polynesia to see how different it is and whether there are mission opportunities there. I thought, "Maybe we need to go now, because later it will be as developed as Papeete and Moorea." The only two places I could fly to—because they are far and require a flight—were here, Tubuai, and another atoll to the northeast of Tahiti, which was closer but also a tourist area. I decided to come here, and it was the right choice.

This place is about 1,000 kilometers south of Papeete, a one-hour and forty-minute flight away. It's less developed, though not wild. You don't see tribes or people living in traditional ways. There are nice roads, and today we toured the island on bikes. This place has almost no tourists. The whole island has a population of just over 2,000—like a small village—and there are maybe 5 to 10 tourists here now. This is what I wanted: a very calm place. You can see I'm on a beach, and this is the main hotel here. There are no people around, almost no cars. It's a really nice place if you want to do a retreat, pray, or just calm down. This is the place for that. And it proved to be the right choice.

And the Lord made it happen. The mission has now achieved something great here, and I will share more about this achievement in one of my upcoming videos. Thank you so much for your prayers. Please continue to pray for this mission and for all the people who have helped make it possible. I want to thank everyone who contributed and supported the mission—it is not because of me, but because of all those who have played a part that this has become possible. Glory be to God for making it happen, for making this mission successful.

So, please, everyone, stay strong in your faith. Know that the Lord is doing His work right now. It’s not as if we’re just waiting for the end of the world or for the Antichrist to appear. No, the Lord is actively spreading His word, His gospel, and we can all contribute to this project. Each one of us has a role to play. Stay strong in faith, stay positive, and know that we will be victorious with the Lord. May His grace and blessings be upon every one of you. God bless.
