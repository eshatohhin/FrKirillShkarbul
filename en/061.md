# Apocalypse, what is it about

Dear brothers and sisters, today's topic is the Revelation of Saint John the Apostle.  
This is the last book of the New Testament, which is very mysterious and has a different style and language compared to other books of the Bible.  
It is placed at the end because it is a prophecy about the end of this world and what will come after this end: the new heaven, the new earth, and the eternal kingdom of God's righteousness and truth, which we all expect and crave.  

It is important to have the right attitude toward this book, to understand what it is, and to know how to read and approach it.  
In the beginning, we read in Chapter 1, Verse 3: "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand."  
The time is very close—the time of the second coming of Jesus Christ.  
This is why everyone who reads and listens to these words, and more importantly, who keeps them, is blessed.  
We need not only to listen to this but to live by it.  
If we want to be blessed, we must pay special attention to this book and what is said within it.  

Some people say, "Well, you just need to be a good Christian. You need to be selfless and know the commandments of Christ. That is most important. Why are you concerned about this apocalyptic stuff? It’s unhealthy; it’s some kind of temptation."  
But no, this is not a temptation unless we make it so. There is a wrong way of understanding and approaching this book.  

So why is this important?  
It is important because Christ Himself prophesied about what will happen in the end.  
We remember that every Gospel contains the prophecy of Christ Himself.  
Before the end of His life, He told His disciples about the things to come: wars, tribulations, the rise of false prophets, and His second coming.  
Later, after His resurrection, two angels came from heaven to testify about His return. They said, "Why are you looking into the sky? He will come again in the same way as He left."  

After His resurrection and ascension, the end times began.  
We are now living in eschatological times—eschaton means "the last."  
We are living in the last times.  
But some may say, "We may not live long enough to witness this in our lifetime. Many Christians have lived for 2,000 years and have not yet seen the second coming. Maybe it will be much later."  

How is this related to us?  
It is directly related to each of us and to the Church as a whole.  
The events of the end times are directly connected to the world now.  
What is happening today is part of the path toward what will happen very soon—perhaps not in our lifetime, but it will be soon.  
And it is related to us right now.  

In Old Testament times, the main expectation was the coming of the Messiah, who would rescue people from sin, ignorance, and suffering.  
Once He came, He gave people the truth and the choice.  
Now, it is a matter of people receiving this truth, following what He said, or choosing to reject it and facing punishment in the last judgment.  

There is nothing else coming.  
This is it.  
We must either be with Christ, following Him, putting all our effort and expectations into Him, or we live as though He will never come, as though it doesn’t matter.  
But this is not the normal way of life for those who believe.

Most people live their lives without expecting that everything will end.  
They work, raise children, and go about their daily routines, but they don’t think about the ultimate end.  
They try to push such thoughts away.  
This mindset causes them to live in an illusion, in a fake world.  
It’s like knowing the road is there but choosing not to walk on it. Instead, they jump into a ditch and perish there.  
Similarly, closing our eyes and ears, refusing to understand what it’s all about, prevents us from being blessed by God.  
It makes us miserable and wastes our entire lives.  

This is why we will be blessed if we read, listen, understand, and keep the words written in the book of Revelation.  

However, another common mistake is that people are afraid of these things.  
They think Revelation is only about punishments and disasters.  
We’ve seen movies like *Apocalypse* or *End of Days*, which depict evil, the devil controlling the world, the Antichrist rising, and catastrophic events.  
These portrayals instill fear in people.  

In the book of Revelation, we read that in the last times, people will even die from fear of what is coming.  
They will be overwhelmed by uncertainty about the future.  
We see this today: during pandemics, some turn to drugs, others fall into depression, and many are consumed by dark thoughts about the future, leading to despair and even suicide.  

As Christians, we should not fear these things.  
Instead, we should be joyful and hopeful.  
Why? Because this book is ultimately about the coming of the eternal world with God.  
That is its main message.  
Yes, there will be suffering and disasters, but these must come before the final relief arrives—the return of the Lord and our full, absolute joy in union with God.  
We should not be afraid, nor should we develop a phobia about these events.  

We must also remember that our personal judgment will occur when we die, and we need to be ready for that.  
We should not become overly obsessed with apocalyptic events if we are not actively following Christ in our daily lives.  

Now, let’s discuss the levels of understanding the book of Revelation.  
Saint Andrew of Caesarea explains that there are three levels of understanding, each corresponding to the spiritual state of the reader or listener.  
The higher one’s spiritual level, the deeper the meaning they can derive from this book.  

1. **The Literal Level**:  
   This is the most basic level, where one understands the literal meaning of what John saw—the visions, symbols, and words spoken.  
   For example, the four horsemen bring disasters, and people read about these events.  
   Many only grasp this level, which is why they become afraid.  
   They focus on the disasters and miss the deeper message.  

2. **The Tropological Level**:  
   The word "tropological" comes from the Greek *tropos*, meaning "way" or "path."  
   At this level, the text directs us on how to live our lives, how to communicate with God, and how to grow spiritually.  
   It’s about applying the teachings of Revelation to our personal spiritual journey.  

3. **The Anagogical Level**:  
   This is the highest level, where the text points to the ultimate fulfillment of God’s plan—the eternal kingdom, the new heaven, and the new earth.  
   It’s about understanding the divine mysteries and the hope of eternal union with God.  

In summary, the book of Revelation is not just about fear and disaster; it’s about hope, joy, and the ultimate victory of God’s kingdom.  
We must approach it with the right attitude, seeking not only to understand its literal meaning but also to apply its teachings to our lives and to glimpse the eternal glory it promises.  
Let us not be afraid but instead be prepared, joyful, and hopeful as we await the fulfillment of God’s plan.

Indeed, it is only Christians who actively pursue a spiritual life who can truly grasp the second level of meaning in the book of Revelation.  
Without an understanding of spiritual realities, this level remains closed to us.  
It’s not enough to simply read the text or study commentaries and say, “Okay, I’ve got it now.”  
No matter how many commentaries we read, if we are not following Christ and living a spiritual life, we will not be able to understand the deeper meaning.  
This is absolutely certain.  

The second level, the **tropological level**, requires us to apply the teachings of Revelation to our spiritual journey.  
It’s about aligning our lives with God’s will, growing in faith, and deepening our relationship with Him.  
This level is accessible only to those who are actively striving to live a Christian life.  

The third level, the **anagogical level**, comes from the Greek word *anagogy*, meaning “going above.”  
This level lifts us to the highest spiritual understanding—the eternal kingdom of God, which will be realized at the end of time after the final judgment.  
It points us to the ultimate fulfillment of God’s plan: the new heaven, the new earth, and the eternal union with God.  

To reach this level, we must be filled with the grace of the Holy Spirit.  
It requires us to transcend earthly concerns, passions, and distractions, allowing our spirits to be lifted by God’s grace into the mysteries of His kingdom.  
However, this level is rare and is attained by only a few who have reached great spiritual heights.  

For most of us, achieving the second level is already a significant success.  
It transforms the way we live, making us more serious about our faith and religious life.  
When we realize that every day brings us closer to the end—that we are counting down, day by day, toward the culmination of history—we become more vigilant and intentional in our spiritual lives.  

For example, if we have a loved one who is terminally ill and has only a year left to live, we would naturally cherish every moment with them, expressing our love and care more fervently.  
In the same way, knowing that the end is approaching should inspire us to live with greater urgency and devotion in our service to Christ.  
This is what it means to be spiritually vigilant—to stay awake, to care deeply about our spiritual lives, and to follow Christ with all our hearts.  

The book of Revelation, when approached with the right attitude, can give us this perspective.  
It reminds us to live with purpose, to love Christ deeply, and to prepare for the eternal kingdom.  
This is the beginning of understanding this profound book.  

Unfortunately, it is not popular today to talk about the end of the world.  
Many prefer to ignore it and focus on enjoying their lives.  
But this mindset leads to suffering, wasted time, and a life devoid of true meaning.  

May the Lord grant us His wisdom and a right heart to approach this book.  
May it give us insight into what is happening in our world, in our lives, and in our souls.  
May God bless you and guide you in understanding His eternal plan. Amen.
