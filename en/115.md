# What is the MAIN goal of Christian life

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in Taichung, a large city in central Taiwan. At one point, there was an idea to make it the capital, but it was later decided that Taipei would serve as the capital instead. Nevertheless, Taichung remains one of Taiwan's three largest cities. Just last night, we held a church meeting, service, and gathering here in Taichung, and I have some thoughts I would like to share with you.

I came to Taiwan 16 years ago. During this time, some people were born and have now almost reached adulthood. Of course, many who were adults then are much older now, and many have already passed away. Sixteen years is a significant period of time, and it is good to reflect on what is happening in this world and why we are here. We see generations passing by, we notice ourselves growing older, and we know that we, too, will eventually leave this place. It is not always easy to discern what the most important goal is. Why are we here, and what should we do? What should our priorities be?

As Christians, we often find ourselves uncertain. Should we devote more effort to prayer? Is that the goal? What is the goal? Should we focus more on our families, raising children, buying a better home, and improving our livelihoods? Is that our Christian ministry? Or should we engage in social work, helping orphans, widows, and the sick? Perhaps we should go on pilgrimages to various places. Or maybe we should dedicate ourselves to research, reading theology, and books about faith. What is the goal? What does Christ expect from me? Should I become a missionary, traveling everywhere to preach? What is the goal that the Lord has set for me?

Time is passing quickly, and in the midst of our daily routines and busy lives, the true treasure often becomes obscured by dust. What I share today may seem self-evident or obvious, but it is often the most obvious things that we forget, and that is why we lose focus in life. This world is like a river, flowing and changing around us. Taiwan has changed significantly, as has Taichung. When I first arrived, there was no subway here; now there is, along with many other changes. The entire world is changing, but where is it heading? As an Orthodox Christian, should my main goal be to fight against the Antichrist and the evil in the world? Or what else should it be?

This situation has given me a clear understanding of what is most important. When I arrived in Taiwan 16 years ago, 97% of the population was Buddhist or pagan, with beliefs rooted in Confucianism, Taoism, and other mixed pagan traditions. Many of those born after my arrival had the opportunity to hear about the faith and become Christians, particularly Orthodox Christians. While not all did, many did. Yet today, we find ourselves in a similar situation: 97% of the population still does not believe in Christ, and most do not even know what Orthodoxy is. This means they believe in something else, having been born and taught differently. Many remain pagan, while others have no faith at all or have turned to various sects. In simple terms, they are heading in the wrong direction.

We know where that direction leads. We know what happened to the pigs that ran off the cliff and drowned in the water. Essentially, that is where the world is heading now.

So, what is the goal for each of us as Christians? The goal is to discover the Gospel—to realize that the Gospel is the source of life and all meaning—and to share this love with others, igniting their love and interest in the Gospel so that they, too, may find the source of life and the way, which is Christ. As He said, "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you" (John 6:53). He also said, "I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in Me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). Without finding Christ, people cannot truly live. They find Him through their love of the Gospel and unite with Him in Holy Communion, receiving His true and precious body and blood.

The first step, of course, is for us to discover this truth ourselves. Often, we think, "The Gospel? We know everything it says. We know what Christ taught. So what?" Yet, we fail to uncover its true treasures. Even atheists study Christianity and know the Gospel better than many believers, but that knowledge alone does not bring them closer to God. For us, it is crucial to find the joy of discovering what the Gospel truly contains. While I cannot share everything now, let me highlight some key points to guide us as we read and strive to live according to the Gospel.

First, we must see that the Gospel grants us victory over this world. It gives us victory over evil, over all the deceptions of this world, and brings us true life and joy. We find joy in being victors over evil and the temptations of this world, free from its entanglements. Through self-denial, self-sacrifice, bearing our cross, and following Christ, we discover the life that fills our souls. We come to love the words of salvation in the Gospel and are compelled to share them with others.

We also experience true blessedness and joy through righteous living—through humility, repentance, meekness, a pure heart, and a clear conscience. This is what we gain by living with Christ, and it brings us profound joy, even amid life's challenges. Despite our struggles—whether depression, competition, financial burdens, family troubles, or sorrows—we often live miserable lives, controlled by temptations and desires for fleeting pleasures. Yet, the Lord offers us freedom through the blessed life He teaches us to live. This joy comes from a clean conscience, a heart purified from all sin and filth, and the healing and transforming love of Christ, which gradually makes our hearts warmer, more receptive, and more compassionate toward others.

Furthermore, we discover the beauty of God's wisdom in the words of the Gospel—its fullness and richness. In contrast, our everyday lives often feel empty, ugly, and impoverished. We seek enjoyment and entertainment, but these things are shallow and unfulfilling. The true joy lies in the treasures hidden in the Gospel, which are revealed as we grow in patience and strength from the Lord. He is strong, mighty, and almighty, and through Him, we find victory in this spiritual battle. This brings us great joy.

In summary, our goal as Christians is to discover the life-giving power of the Gospel, to live in union with Christ, and to share this transformative love with others. Through this, we find true joy, freedom, and victory over the world's temptations and deceptions.

And this will fill our lives with meaning. It will transform our perspective so that we no longer think, "Oh, I wish I could die soon. Why must I endure such a long life?" Instead, having discovered Christ, we long to be with Him, yet we also cherish each day He gives us, knowing that every day has great purpose. Each day is an opportunity to grow in joy and to prepare for a greater reward in heaven. 

We must also share this truth with others. First, we must love and appreciate deeply what we gain from the Gospel every day. Then, we must extend that love to those around us. So many people are wasting their lives, day by day, growing older, and eventually passing away without ever discovering the true meaning of life. We have the responsibility to share the Gospel with them. 

Everything else I mentioned earlier—prayer, family, social work, pilgrimage, theological study, missionary work—all of these are important and good, but they are extensions of the central goal. The door to everything is the Gospel and Christ Himself. Sometimes, people ask, "How do I share the Gospel?" Start by bringing someone to church. Perhaps our parents or grandparents did this at some point, and it is a good beginning. They may sense that salvation is found in the church, but this alone is not enough. We must focus more deeply on the words of Christ, on living a life rooted in the Gospel, and on understanding its immense value. We must recognize how precious and life-giving the Gospel is, not just in theory but in our daily lives.

Let us live with the Gospel, by the Gospel, and share it with everyone around us. Let us find joy in fulfilling this central goal of our lives every single day. Amen. God bless.
