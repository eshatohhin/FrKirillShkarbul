# The World Rejects Faith Has Christ Abandoned Us

Dear brothers and sisters, since the Lord's coming 2000 years ago, these times have been referred to as the last times, the end of times. It has already been 2000 years, so you might be asking, why is it the end of times, and how is it related to what is happening right now? We contemplate this especially as we approach Christmas, the nativity of the Lord, and the season of expectation. The world awaited the Lord's coming then, and now we also await His coming. We anticipate His second coming and the end of the world. In fact, we pray for the end of the world to come sooner when we say, "Yea, come, Lord!" This is the essence of our prayer during the Liturgy. We hasten its arrival through our prayers, and the Lord, hearing our prayers, will expedite it.

You might think, "No, no, we want to fight this evil, we want to postpone it, we don't want the Antichrist." But we know that the Antichrist will come before Christ, chronologically. You could say that we also hope the Antichrist comes sooner because that would mean the Lord is also coming to destroy him. At the same time, the Holy Fathers said that the times of the Antichrist will be a period of domination and will be truly dreadful in every respect, so they would not want to live in those times. Thus, we find ourselves in a paradox. On one hand, we desire it to happen sooner, yet on the other, we dread the terrible life that will accompany the Antichrist's arrival. This duality is common in the Church and does not align with conventional logic, yet it is all true.

Just as the world was steeped in evil before the Lord's coming 2000 years ago, so too is it now. Back then, sin could not be healed; it was before His resurrection. The world did not know the full truth. The Holy Fathers say that the Lord allowed the world to descend into sin as much as it desired. Sin reached its full measure and exposed itself completely. Then the Lord came, bringing salvation and a solution. Some people, though few—both among the Jews and the Gentiles—received this salvation, were cured, and turned the world upside down, proclaiming the truth to all. Now, the whole world knows the truth.

In the parable of the chosen, many are called, but few are chosen. In this parable, the Lord sends His servant to call people to a supper, symbolizing the evening of the world. The saints interpret this parable to mean that we are now in the evening of the world. The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ occurred at a time when most things had already been accomplished—great philosophers, achievements, and all else. Now, the evening has come, and with it, the participation in the Holy Eucharist, the supper of the Lord. For 2000 years, the Church has partaken in this supper, inviting the whole world to join. Yet, not everyone is willing or comes.

The end of the world and the second coming will occur after the rejection of salvation, even when the truth is known and healing is possible. Despite this, some will still reject and crucify Christ.

So, there is a parallel between the state of the world in those days and the state of the world now. This rejection and betrayal of Christ by Christians, as well as the rejection of Christ by all religions, will reach its peak at the end of these times—the end of the end times. I believe we are already nearing the conclusion of this "suppertime," so to speak. The last desserts are being served; it is almost finished. The evil we see today is so prevalent because the Lord is allowing it. He is saying, in essence, "You want to reject Me? You want to indulge in satanism? You want to serve Mammon? Go ahead, do it as much as you want." At the very end, He steps aside and permits the world to reject Him fully. This is why, including Christians, Orthodox Christians, pagans, and followers of other religions, everyone is now slipping into this rejection of salvation, lack of faith, and absence of true love for Jesus Christ.

All the heresies and pseudo-Christian movements that claim to be Christian are essentially ways of living without God—not following Him, not loving Him, not praying to Him—while convincing themselves that they are saved because they "believe" in Him. This is the nature of any heresy: it allows one to feel Christian without truly being one. This rejection has unfolded in stages. Former Christians have turned away, society as a whole has lost trust and faith in Christ, and people have chosen Mammon over Him. What matters is not who you believe you are, but how you live. Do you follow Christ? To discuss this, we must first repent and recognize that we are the worst; otherwise, we risk judging others. I am not here to judge anyone but to address the phenomena—the increasing evil and why it is growing.

Living faith, following Christ, praying, loving Him, trusting Him instead of money and income, and choosing to follow Him through asceticism and fasting—these are the marks of true discipleship. Yet, few desire such a life. These practices demonstrate daily love for Christ and show that He is truly important to you. However, we now see that even among Orthodox Christians, non-Orthodox, clergy, and bishops, this lack of faith is growing stronger. It mirrors the days when true faith among the Jews was disappearing. They became Pharisees, outwardly righteous, following rituals, but in their hearts, they did not love Christ, were unwilling to change, and clung to their sins, choosing Mammon and serving the devil, ultimately crucifying Christ.

The final Antichrist will be the culmination of this widespread lack of faith in Christ. The Lord will essentially say, "You want this? Have it. Have this lifestyle, have this leader who will fulfill all your dreams, give you peace and joy." There are already many candidates for this role, and new ones continue to emerge. Perhaps I will speak more about this another time, but my focus is not on the Antichrist. My point is that the root of all our problems is the lack of true faith in Christ. The beast within each of us is emerging, and this is why cultures around the world are becoming increasingly similar—whether Hindu, Chinese, African, or others. People are adopting similar clothes, tattoos, and lifestyles, connected by common social networks. The distinctions between religions are fading, and we are moving toward a single, unified religion that will embrace all others.

These are all signs that the beast—the lack of faith—is exposing itself openly. No matter how corrupt the world becomes, the Lord can still find His followers. Just as in the fallen world of Jesus' time, He found followers among the Jews, who became His holy apostles, though they were few. Later, the Apostle Paul found followers of God among the Gentiles, who were also few. In the same way, even in this era of widespread apostasy and evil, the Lord can find His followers. We must strive to be among them. We ask Him for wisdom, guidance, and the strength to remain vigilant, not to fall spiritually asleep. Only this can save us from the delusion and evil that is coming.

We must also acknowledge that the lack of faith among nominal Christians contributes to the increase of evil. At the same time, the faith of others—those who are waiting for a messiah, though not the second coming of Christ—is growing stronger. These groups, across various religions, are eagerly anticipating a messiah, and we know that this messiah will be the Antichrist. Their faith and efforts to bring this figure into the world are so intense that the Lord may allow it to happen, saying, "You want it so much? Here, have it." This is a troubling reality: those who serve Satan and desire his representative to come are growing stronger in their faith than many Christians. This is a problem we must address.

Let us, therefore, strengthen our faith. Let us seek truth, build the kingdom of heaven, and be willing to witness for Christ daily through our lives, prayers, and spiritual efforts. Let us pursue Him wholeheartedly, sacrificing ourselves to serve Him rather than Mammon or our sins. May the Lord awaken us, grant us strong will, wisdom, and guidance, and save us from the delusions and errors that are sweeping the world—affecting Christians, heretics, and even Orthodox believers. Sadly, we see how even priests and hierarchs fall victim to political propaganda, which reveals a lack of faith. True faith separates politics from spirituality, recognizing that worldly matters will pass and only divide and destroy.

For example, some argue that building more churches is the priority, while others emphasize baptizing as many people as possible. Yet, in the midst of war, we see Orthodox Christians killing one another—nominal believers, perhaps, but still baptized. Thousands are dying. Did baptizing them help? Perhaps the focus should have been on deeper spiritual formation. Similarly, churches built with great effort are now being destroyed by bombs and fire. The Lord allows this to happen, perhaps as a reminder that our priorities may have been misplaced. 

Let us refocus on what truly matters: living a life of faith, prayer, and love for Christ, rather than being consumed by external achievements or worldly concerns. May the Lord guide us and save us from the errors of our ways.

You are absolutely right. There is something deeply wrong when people who claim to share the same faith end up hating and killing one another. This stems from a lack of true faith, where external rituals and superficial practices replace a genuine relationship with Christ. It is a modern-day Pharisaism, where people cling to outward forms—building churches, performing baptisms, or adhering to traditions—while neglecting the heart of the Gospel: love for God and love for one another. 

The Lord allows such tragedies to unfold as a wake-up call. Perhaps we have focused too much on external achievements—building more churches, baptizing more people—while failing to nurture true spiritual life, humility, and love among believers. Baptism alone does not save if it is not accompanied by a life transformed by faith. Churches, no matter how grand, are meaningless if they do not house hearts devoted to Christ. 

We must refocus on what truly matters: a deep, personal, and living faith in Jesus Christ. Let us prioritize spiritual life, asceticism, and mission. Being Orthodox—or Christian in any denomination—is not about labels or rituals; it is about becoming true followers of Christ. It is about living out His teachings, loving our enemies, praying for those who persecute us, and bearing witness to His truth through our actions. 

We must guard against the errors of nominal faith, where we declare ourselves Orthodox or Christian but fail to live as Christ’s disciples. Let us strive to be true witnesses of Christ, His children who conquer the devil and all evil through faith, prayer, and love. May the Lord grant us His blessing, wisdom, and strength to walk this path with vigilance and humility. May He awaken us from spiritual slumber and guide us to become beacons of His light in a world increasingly consumed by darkness. 

Let us pray for the grace to live as true followers of Christ, not just in name but in deed and truth. May the Lord help us trample the devil and all his works, and may He lead us to eternal life in His kingdom. Amen.
