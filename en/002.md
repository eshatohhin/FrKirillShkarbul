# Why devil is “a snake”

Dear friends, today we're going to discuss our first topic: why the devil is depicted as a snake. Now, we don't particularly focus on the devil, and this just happens to be our first topic—not because it's extremely important, but because I think you'll find it interesting. In Genesis, we see the devil, as a snake, tempting Adam and Eve, leading them to commit sin, resulting in the fall of humanity. God then promises them a savior, salvation, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. So, why a snake? Why not a pig, a goat, or a dog? There are several reasons for this.

First, a snake moves on its belly. This symbolizes what the devil desires for people—to live solely by their belly, focusing only on material needs like food, comfort, and possessions. The devil tries to convince people that their primary concern should be satisfying their basic needs. You might ask, what's wrong with that? After all, Maslow's hierarchy of needs suggests that basic needs must be met first. The trick here is that while fulfilling basic needs is necessary, they shouldn't be the main focus of one's life. For instance, we need to breathe to live, but breathing isn't the main goal of our lives. Similarly, God wants us to aim for higher values and assures us that He will provide for our needs. Our main goal shouldn't be just to satisfy our basic needs.

The devil, contrary to God's will, wants us to live by our belly, not by our heart or mind. This is part of the biblical symbolism. Another reason is related to the snake's diet. Snakes eat whatever falls to the ground, often consuming decomposing animals or spoiled fruits. Similarly, the devil wants people to feed on surrogates rather than the word of God or things of true value. He distracts us with modern gadgets, material possessions, and low-quality entertainment, making us believe these are important. God, however, wants us to seek nourishment that feeds our hearts and souls.

Lastly, the snake communicates by whispering, which symbolizes the subtle and deceptive way the devil influences people. This whispering represents the cunning and insidious nature of the devil's temptations. These are some of the reasons why the devil is depicted as a snake in biblical texts.

The devil delivers his message in a subtle, indirect manner, much like the whispering of a snake. He doesn’t speak openly or clearly but instead creates noise and distractions. For example, advertisements often use background music, flashy visuals, and overwhelming stimuli to convey a message that encourages you to buy something. Similarly, when we encounter bad suggestions or temptations, they often come in a low, insidious voice—perhaps from someone urging us to betray, steal, or avoid responsibilities. Even our own negative thoughts often manifest as whispers in our minds. This is why the devil is depicted as a snake, symbolizing his deceptive and cunning nature.

We must guard ourselves against such noise. When we return from work, the market, or any busy environment, the noise we’ve been exposed to lingers in our minds. We need to let this noise settle before making important decisions. Decisions made hastily, in a rushed or noisy state, are often influenced by the devil and can lead to suffering. This is why it’s crucial to avoid making quick decisions in chaotic or distracting environments.

The fourth reason the snake symbolizes the devil is its bending, winding movement. A snake doesn’t move in a straight line or face you directly; it approaches indirectly, reflecting the treacherous nature of the devil. The devil is a liar, the father of lies, and he never communicates truthfully or directly. Whenever we encounter a message filled with lies, manipulation, or trickery, we can be sure it originates from or is endorsed by the devil. This indirect, deceitful approach is another reason the snake is associated with the devil.

The fifth reason is the snake’s venom. A snake carries poison, and its bite can be deadly. Similarly, engaging with the devil is extremely dangerous. There should be no communication, dialogue, or compromise with the devil, demons, or evil influences. We must cut off all ties with those who seek to lead us into sin or corruption. If someone tries to tempt us or lead us astray, we should firmly decline, saying, “I’m busy; I don’t have time for that.” This is a vital lesson we must learn.

Finally, we recall the Lord’s words that the offspring of Eve—referring to Jesus Christ—will crush the head of the snake, while the snake will strike at the heel. This has deep theological significance, pointing to Christ’s victory over evil. However, it also applies to us as individuals. The devil can “bite” us in the heel, targeting our flesh—our basic, carnal nature. Every human has flesh, instincts, and bodily desires. The devil exploits these aspects of our humanity—our need for food, our senses, and our physical instincts—to harm us, ultimately aiming to destroy our souls. His goal is destruction, and we must remain vigilant to protect ourselves from his influence.

These are the lessons we can draw from the image of the devil as a snake. We must remain vigilant, understanding how the devil operates and how he seeks to ruin our lives. It’s essential to learn how to guard ourselves against his influence. 

We also recall Emperor Constantine, who played a pivotal role in establishing Christianity as the dominant faith in the Roman Empire. Above his throne, there was an image of a snake being pierced—a symbol of the cross—and a painting depicting the snake’s defeat. This imagery signified the triumph over paganism, a self-serving religion that worshipped mammon (material wealth). It represented the overthrow of such destructive forces and the establishment of a new order rooted in faith. 

In the same way, we must strive to overthrow the devil’s influence in our hearts, families, and the world. We must not allow him to work through us or around us. May God bless you, grant you strength, and fill you with wisdom as you navigate these challenges. Amen.
