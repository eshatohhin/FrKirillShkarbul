# Mission on the Tahiti Island

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in the southern part of the island of Tahiti.  
We have made a full circle around Tahiti today.  
A woman kindly offered to take me around the entire island.  
We met many people and distributed leaflets.  
Behind me is a waterfall, known as the Three Waterfalls Place. You can see one of the waterfalls here.  
We hope that, like the water of life, the good news will flow freely here, and many people will come to know the Lord.  
Glory to God!
