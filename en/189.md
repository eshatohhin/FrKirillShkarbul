# 33 Sri Lankans baptized Orthodox

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in Sri Lanka, in a place called Negombo, which is right on the beach. You can see the sea behind me, and you can hear the sound of the waves. It was here, in this very place, that we held a baptism just a few days ago. Thirty-three Sri Lankans were baptized, and the Lord granted me the opportunity to return here and share this experience with you through this video.

On that day, there was heavy rain and enormous waves—it felt like a storm. When we arrived in the morning, around 10 o'clock, having traveled from the center of the island, we found ourselves unable to proceed as planned. The locals, who are predominantly Buddhist, often create difficulties for us, especially during large gatherings like baptisms. While baptizing one or two people is manageable, a larger group attracts significant opposition. As a result, we had no choice but to come here, despite the three-hour drive from our original location.

When we arrived, the weather was so severe that we couldn’t proceed with the baptism as intended. We searched for a suitable spot and eventually found one nearby, though it was under construction and filled with debris. We had to clean the area, which took some time, but eventually, we were able to conduct the baptism. That day was filled with challenges—missing supplies, the weather, and the logistical hurdles. It was a day that truly tested our faith and determination.

This experience reminded me of the challenges we face as Christians. Taking up the cross of the Lord is not easy. If we are to become true Christians, we must be prepared for storms—temptations, sorrows, and pains. In that sense, the day was deeply symbolic.

Today, by contrast, feels like paradise. The baptism itself took about six to seven hours from start to finish, and by the time we were done, it was already dark. You can see this in the photos. We baptized around twelve children and adults, following all the canonical procedures, including anointing and chrismation. The entire process took the whole day. Many of the participants were fasting, which added to the challenge, but I believe everyone will remember this day with joy. It was something we had been anticipating for nearly a year.

We traveled with a large group to find a suitable location for the baptism. The waves were too high on one side, making it impossible to proceed there. The lake was also unsuitable—too shallow and dirty, with fish swimming around. Eventually, we found a spot a short distance away, and there we conducted the baptism. Each person was supported by at least two of us, and sometimes even three, as the waves were so strong. But with the Lord’s blessing, everyone was baptized and chrismated.

Afterward, I presented them with gifts from the church—icons, name icons, crosses, and prayer robes. We truly felt like one family. We then shared a small meal, including a barbecue, right here. This was the first large-scale group baptism we’ve conducted in Sri Lanka, and it was an immense blessing. Words cannot fully express the significance of this event, and I hope it marks the beginning of something truly great.

Since then, we’ve made progress with government registration and have visited several pastors in the area. We traveled to the south and met with two pastors here in Negombo who were attending a conference. We’ve also been to other places, such as Anamaduwa, spreading the seeds of faith. Many people are still considering their decision, but many have already made the choice to follow Christ.

This time, I also traveled to the south, and perhaps I’ll make a video about that experience. There’s a community there of about 200 people who have faced significant challenges. This year, the Buddhists confronted them because they decided to build a church. This community is preparing to become Orthodox, which is why we visited them. In that area, there are no other Christian communities—only Buddhists. There’s a very powerful Buddhist monastery nearby, and the villagers can be quite aggressive. 

When the community began building their church, the Buddhists came, shouting at them and even physically attacking them. A fight broke out, and the government sided with the Buddhists. It was an immense challenge for this small community. Yet, I believe the Lord is leading them to the true faith through these trials. 

So much is happening here in Sri Lanka. The workers are few, but the harvest is plentiful. And those who are willing to come here and serve are even fewer. This weighs heavily on my heart. I truly hope that more missionaries will arise—people willing to leave behind whatever they must to come here and to other countries, to carry out the true mission of spreading the faith, inspiring repentance, and helping others live a Christian life, free from sin. 

Let us pray together. Please pray for the mission here in Sri Lanka. Pray for my mission, as I also have work to do in India this time. I’ll share more about that in future videos. I need your prayers, and the people here need your prayers. We pray for one another. Stay strong, and I hope to see you again soon. God bless.
