# Who are “the chosen ones” by God

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about being chosen by God. This is important because it concerns each and every one of us. Are we the chosen ones, or are we not? And for what purpose are we chosen? We are chosen to be the receivers, the heirs of the kingdom of heaven and of eternal life and joy with God, in eternal union with Jesus Christ in the heavens. This is a very critical point, and we need to know first if we are chosen ourselves, and if we are chosen, is this enough? Can we simply relax and wait for something good to happen?

First, we need to address a common question people ask: How is it that Christians, those who follow Christ, those who are true disciples of Christ, are the chosen ones and receive this gift freely? It's not that they have to earn it through merits. We know that this salvation and chosenness are given freely, and God knew about this and chose them. Meanwhile, others, such as pagans and non-Christians, are not chosen by God, and this is not their fault because they are not chosen. This may seem unfair, but people are not guilty of not being chosen.

However, this issue is a false one because, in fact, the Lord chooses only those who are able to fulfill His purpose. We can draw an analogy with the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, the people of Israel were chosen. They were chosen to be the bearers of God's light, bringing the truth of faith to all other nations. They lived according to the law, received the law, preserved the law of God, and were given the true scripture, knowledge, and worship. They were entrusted with these treasures by God because they were chosen. However, despite being chosen, not all of them received Christ and became children of the kingdom of heaven. Only a few truly became Christians.

This new Israel, these few Christians, brought the kingdom of God to all nations, enabling every nation to enter heaven. A great multitude of people were drawn to salvation, which is why the Church grew and spread to every country. Now, when we speak of the new Israel, we are referring to the Church—those who are called by God and follow Christ. First, we must remember that we are not just one religion among many. We are the people chosen by God. This is a critical distinction, and we need to emphasize that others, unfortunately, are not chosen.

We are chosen freely to have this faith, to follow Christ, and to love Him. However, we must value this chosenness and treasure it as a precious gift. It is not something we can take for granted simply because we were born into it or received it freely. We must recognize that this is a precious gift that some people lack. Even though we have it, it does not guarantee that we will enter the kingdom of heaven. Just as in the Old Testament, not all of Israel entered the new Israel, only a few did. Similarly, we, as the chosen ones now chosen for salvation and eternal life, may be led astray, misled, and perish, failing to inherit eternal life.

This is the primary goal of the demons—to lead us astray, to make us lose our path, to prevent us from following Christ and receiving true life in the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, we must remain vigilant and steadfast in our faith, cherishing the gift of chosenness and striving to fulfill the purpose for which we were chosen.

This is why we must put significant effort and focus into pursuing this path, realizing our chosenness, and making it a reality. This is a crucial goal. Just as someone chosen to become an Olympic champion or to participate in the Olympics must train diligently—because even if they are chosen, they might lose their form in the months leading up to the event, fail to compete, or lose the competition—so too must we strive to fulfill our chosenness. If we do not reach the goal, our chosenness loses its value. Participating but failing brings no honor; it only brings shame. Therefore, it is not enough to simply be chosen; we must also reach the goal.

May the Lord grant us the strength to persevere. We must remember that not believing in Him separates us completely from His grace. Christ said that He would send the Holy Spirit to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. The core sin is not believing in Him, the Son of Man. This is the fundamental sin for anyone. Those who do not believe in Christ or follow Him—whether they adhere to another religion or claim to be Christian in name only—are living in sin. This leads to destruction, and they are not truly chosen. It is vital to avoid this path and abandon anything that leads us away from Christ. Instead, we must walk the path of following Him, living with Him, and loving Him.

May God help us on this journey, giving us strength, motivation, and the grace to receive the true salvation that awaits us at the end of the world. Let us remain steadfast in our faith, treasuring our chosenness and striving to fulfill the purpose for which we were called.
