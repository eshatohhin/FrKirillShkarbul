# Is the “world” good or evil

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about this world and whether it is something good or something bad, because we read different things in the Bible. We read that this world is created by God, blessed by God, and given to man for management. Man enjoys this world in paradise, Eden—Eden means pleasure—so this is a place where there should be a lot of pleasure, and everything seems to be fine. Later, the people of Israel are promised the Promised Land, a land God promises will bring fruit and be a great blessing for them. So, we see that there is something material in this world that is promised and given by God. Thus, it seems there is nothing inherently bad in this world. 

Moreover, the Lord Himself comes and becomes flesh, becoming human like us, which signifies that He is blessing and affirming this world as something good. This stands in contrast to the heresy of Gnosticism, which claimed that this world is evil, created by a malevolent god, and that matter is the source of evil. Gnosticism, influenced by Platonism and Greek philosophy, valued abstract, absolute ideas and viewed this world as a source of temptation, filth, and dirt. This heresy influenced many Christian communities and thinkers, but it is indeed a heresy because God has blessed this world and everything in it. 

We have discussed how nature praises the Lord, as we read in the Psalms: the moon, sun, stars, rivers, mountains, and flowers all celebrate and praise the Lord. Therefore, there is no problem with this created material world. However, we also read in the Gospel that Christ said, "Do not love this world or what is in this world," and the Apostle Paul stated that this world lies in evil. Additionally, the Lord speaks of the "ruler of this world," referring to Satan, who has power and control over this world. 

Thus, there is a tension between the world and Christ, His message, and His Gospel. There is enmity, as this world is represented by Mammon, and the Lord says, "You cannot serve both God and Mammon." So, there is great danger in this world. What is this danger? Essentially, this created world can become one of two things for us. It can become a school for knowing God, learning His wisdom, and understanding how to praise and thank Him—a true school of righteousness and sanctity. Alternatively, it can become a source of temptation, leading us away from God, misleading us, pulling us in the wrong direction, and ultimately resulting in the destruction of our lives and a miserable outcome. 

The Lord even refers to those who do not know Him or follow Him as "dead"—they are still living, but they are already dead, like corpses. These are harsh words, but we must understand their meaning and how to reconcile these ideas.

The Lord says in His prayer to God the Father that He asks not to take His disciples out of the world but to protect them from evil. From this, we can see that the Lord approves of this world but disapproves of the evil within it. This evil can become so pervasive and dominant that it becomes the law, the governing force, and the principle of this world. This is what we observe, and it seems to be growing worse over time. 

We recall the story of the Tower of Babel, where people came together to build something grand, but they did so without God. They were driven by pride and arrogance, believing in their own power and ability to achieve greatness. The Lord cursed their efforts, confused their languages, and scattered them, causing their project to fail. This illustrates what happens when people focus solely on this world, disregarding God. Without God, what do they care about? They care about making this world their kingdom, about developing it. 

The word "development" comes to mind. What is the driving force behind all the advancements in technology, the creation of airplanes, communication systems, and infrastructure? Is it to glorify God, or is it an attempt to create a stable, self-sufficient world? We build towering structures, bridges, and systems designed to provide comfort and last for centuries. If we compare the world today to the world 2,000 or 3,000 years ago, we see a stark difference. In the past, people lived as though they were guests in this world—they came, they accomplished certain things, engaged in wars, and then departed. Today, however, we focus on making this world a permanent home. We create pension plans, accumulate wealth, and strive for financial freedom, believing that this world is all we have and that it is precious. 

This is precisely what the Lord warns against. When we prioritize this world above all else, it becomes mammon, an idol that blocks God and separates us from Him. This is the danger we must remember. So, where is the solution to these problems? The answer lies in Christ Himself. Only through Christ and in Christ can we find harmony and synthesis. We are not called to escape from this world into some abstract, spiritual fantasy. No, we are called to live in this world while carrying the kingdom of heaven within us. This kingdom unites everything for us. We are not afraid of the evil in this world because we are protected. We have, in a sense, a vaccine against evil—we turn away from it and remain steadfast in our faith. 

In Christ, we find the balance. We live in this world, but we are not of it. We engage with it, but we do not let it consume us. The kingdom of heaven within us empowers us to navigate the challenges of this world without being overcome by its temptations. This is the path we are called to follow.

And we are not afraid to face this world and to carry on the mission, to continue the mission of Christ, who came into the world. Now, He sends us into this world to bear His mission and keep going, to continue His work. This should give us great power and motivation to persevere, to keep bearing fruit for our Lord. This is the solution. 

In 1 Corinthians 15:32, the Apostle Paul says, "If there is no resurrection, everything I do is meaningless. What should we do? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." This is what life becomes without the resurrection, which is found in Christ. He said, "I am the life and the resurrection." If Christ is not in our lives, if we do not experience and anticipate the resurrection, then this world becomes nothing more than a place where we eat, drink, and have fun, knowing that tomorrow we will die. We simply try to get as much as we can out of this life. This is a completely flawed logic. 

With Christ, we can still eat and drink—there is no problem with that—but we will know what is truly important and what is not. We will understand that ministry to our Lord is the most important priority in our lives. May the Lord grant us this understanding, protect us from all kinds of temptations, misunderstandings, and mistakes, and give us His blessing, His wisdom, and His guidance. Amen.
