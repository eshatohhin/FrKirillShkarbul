# Spiritual food. How to eat healthy

Dear brothers and sisters,  

These days, more and more people are concerned about their diet—eating healthy food, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, striving to be healthy, living longer, and even saving the planet by avoiding the use of chemicals in food production, despite its profitability. However, humans are not composed solely of the body. We know that we possess an immortal soul and are spiritual beings. This means that, in addition to earthly food, we also need spiritual nourishment. This is the topic I wish to address, as we often overlook what we are being fed spiritually and what constitutes true spiritual food.  

There are various types of spiritual food. We recall that when the disciples returned and found Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, they said, "We brought food. Let's eat." But the Lord responded, "I have food that you do not know of." They thought someone had brought Him food, but He explained, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, the works of God the Father." That was His sustenance.  

We also remember the temptation of Christ in the wilderness, where He fasted for 40 days. When He grew hungry, the devil said, "If You are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread." But Jesus replied, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" Thus, the Word of God is spiritual food—the best nourishment for our spirit.  

Additionally, we recall when Jesus warned His disciples in the boat, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." He used the analogy of leaven in food to illustrate how certain influences can corrupt the soul. The leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy, while the leaven of the Sadducees is liberal, materialistic thinking. The Sadducees denied the resurrection, the afterlife, and many of God's commandments, recognizing only the Torah—the five books of the Pentateuch. Sadly, both of these "leavens" are present in the church today, and we must be cautious of the spiritual food we consume, as some can harm us.  

Drawing an analogy to physical food, sometimes we eat something tasty, only to suffer stomachaches or other issues later. Similarly, we might watch an exciting movie, only to feel anxious or depressed afterward without understanding why. Just as some people repeatedly eat foods that upset their stomachs without questioning the cause, many of us fail to reflect on why we experience spiritual distress. Perhaps it stems from conversations we’ve had, the lifestyle we lead, or the spiritual "food" we consume.  

On the other hand, some foods may not be tasty but are healthy. For example, salads or other nutritious meals may not appeal to everyone initially, but they are beneficial. The same applies to spiritual food. It may feel unfamiliar or unappealing at first, but it is nourishing. Over time, we can develop a habit of consuming healthy spiritual food, just as our bodies can adapt to a healthier diet.  

We must also consider the influences around us—what kind of music we listen to, what movies we watch, and the people who shape our lives. Some spiritual "foods" can create dependency, much like how some people become addicted to fast food. For instance, many feel compelled to eat at McDonald's repeatedly, even when it harms their health. Similarly, certain spiritual influences can lead us astray, leaving us spiritually malnourished or even damaged.  

Let us, therefore, be mindful of the spiritual food we consume, seeking what truly nourishes our souls and aligns with the will of God.  

Amen.

Or they drink Coke, or they feel they must have coffee to function. These are things that can make people addicted. I have nothing against coffee, but when we become dependent on something, it is no longer healthy. The same applies to spiritual food. Some people constantly watch action movies or seek other forms of excitement. They crave that stimulus, that thrill. This is a bad habit—an addiction to unhealthy spiritual food.  

There are two general types of spiritual food. The first is what we absorb into ourselves: the things we watch, the books we read, the conversations we have, whether in person or on social media. All of this is what we embrace and internalize. The second type is what we do—our actions. This includes our deeds, the things we do for the Lord, and the actions we take based on our faith. These are healthy spiritual foods that nourish and strengthen us.  

Prayer is also a vital part of this spiritual diet. It is something we do, and it makes us healthier and more vigilant. Christ calls us to be spiritually vigilant, not to drift into spiritual slumber. People often ask, "What does that mean?" It means prayer must be a priority in our lives. We are called to pray daily and fervently. Prayer keeps us alert and connected to God.  

Just as athletes or models carefully monitor their diets to maintain their physical condition, Christians must also be diligent about their spiritual diet. If we want to remain spiritually healthy, resist temptations, and stand firm against evil, we must continually evaluate what we consume spiritually.  

Sometimes, physical diets are used to cleanse the body—drinking only water or eating only potatoes for a period. Similarly, fasting serves as an intensive spiritual cleanse, purging the soul of accumulated negativity and sin.  

In our modern age, we are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of spiritual "food" every day. Information floods in from radios, social media, smartphones, TV, and more. We are immersed in a virtual world, constantly consuming content. This is a stark contrast to life 100 or 200 years ago, when people lived in simpler environments, with fewer distractions and less information. Back then, daily life was more predictable, and the pace was slower.  

Today, we must be especially mindful of the spiritual food we consume. Just as we carefully choose what we eat to maintain physical health, we must also be intentional about the spiritual influences we allow into our lives. By doing so, we can grow stronger in faith, resist temptation, and remain vigilant in our walk with God.  

Amen.

What is happening now is akin to living in a fridge or a barn stuffed with all kinds of food. Most of this food is tasty but harmful—hamburgers, candies, chocolates, and the like. We are trapped in this environment, much like the cartoon rat that lives in a fridge, gorging itself on everything inside until it becomes fat and unhealthy. This is what is happening to us spiritually. We consume everything we hear, watch, and embrace, becoming spiritually "fat." We grow powerless, unable to serve the Lord effectively, and we fall prey to all kinds of spiritual sicknesses. Just as physically overweight people are more prone to illness, spiritually "fat" individuals are more vulnerable to spiritual ailments.  

This is why we live in a spiritual desert. Few people truly live by faith and bear fruit for the Lord. Being a nominal Christian is meaningless. If we are like those fat rats, calling ourselves Christians holds no value. We must be different. Otherwise, we build with one hand and destroy with the other. We may pray and attempt to do good, but then we watch movies or engage in activities that undermine our efforts. We must build with both hands, striving to become spiritually healthy, true soldiers of Christ, and bearers of fruit for the Lord. This means ministering to Him and others, sacrificing ourselves, and remaining vigilant in prayer.  

We cannot simply sit at home, spiritually idle. Consider the analogy of children who spend all day playing computer games. They learn nothing, refuse to go to school, and lack basic life skills like cooking or cleaning. Similarly, many of us are spiritually unskilled. We don’t know how to minister to the Lord, so we fill our time with busyness—always occupied with this or that, but gaining no spiritual benefit.  

Let us be wise. Let us ask the Lord to give us hearts eager for change, hearts like those of athletes who train daily, willing to sacrifice and push themselves to become stronger and faster. We must adopt a spiritual lifestyle, disciplined and focused on what truly matters. May the Lord help us, bless us, and grant us His grace.  

Christ is risen!
