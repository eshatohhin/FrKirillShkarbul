# We Live in a World of Dreams

Dear brothers and sisters, in the most important prayer, the Lord's Prayer, the Lord teaches us to pray to God, asking not to be led into temptation but to be delivered from the evil one.  
This is so important for us—to avoid being led into temptation. The words of the Apostle Paul remind us that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.  
This tells us that most people have already been pulled into this temptation, into this darkness, and for us to escape this darkness would require a miracle from God.  
Otherwise, we are doomed to sit in darkness, doomed to remain in some form of temptation, in some form of deceit.  

Today, I want to speak about myth, a very popular topic in philosophy and social thought in the 20th and 21st centuries.  
The idea of myth brings us to some very fundamental questions: What is reality? What is real, and what is not real?  
Usually, we think of myth as something like a fairy tale—something made up, a fantasy.  
In reality, however, it is not a fantasy. This also leads us to the topic of the matrix and living in a fake reality.  
All these topics are related in some sense. Today, I want to share with you some thoughts about why we are now experiencing all these wars.  

Recently, my relative was killed in this war. This great pain has led me to deeply consider what it means to believe in a myth,  
to be part of a myth that leads people to death—both physical and spiritual.  
Moreover, these myths exist at different levels: global, societal, group, and individual.  
Some myths transcend these levels. But before I delve into this, I want to share with you the nature of myth.  
What is its core nature, and who is producing all these myths?  

The nature of myth is not simply that it is a made-up story. Rather, it is an interpretation of certain physical phenomena.  
For example, in the 20th century, we witnessed the significant phenomenon of socialism.  
Of course, workers faced many problems, and some people came forward and said, "You know who is responsible for your problems?  
The cause is those exploiters—the bourgeois, the capitalists. They exploit you, and here are the reasons."  
They provided a scientific sociological framework to explain class struggles and other such concepts, which, in reality, are oversimplified interpretations of complex phenomena.  
It has been proven that these systems do not match reality, yet they can appear to explain it.  
In some countries or settings, this narrative may seem like reality, but in truth, it is merely a constructed interpretation of events.  

People embraced socialism, Nazism, or even capitalism. Even the term "capitalism" is not an objective reality but a mental framework created to explain certain phenomena.  
These different "isms," these frameworks, caused immense pain and suffering in the 20th century.  
The First World War was fueled by nationalism, imperialism, and other ideologies that drove nations to destroy one another.  
Since then, we have seen countless other examples, continuing up to the present day.  

You might argue that we have learned from these lessons, that we will not repeat the radicalism of the Nazis or the revolutionaries who shed rivers of blood.  
You might say we reject red terror and other forms of totalitarian regimes, that we have learned our lesson.  
But I can tell you this: we have learned nothing.

There is a misconception. We think that now we believe in money, in physical things. We believe that we can buy this or that,  
that we can earn money here, save it there, and that this is what is real. We say, "I don’t care about politics. I don’t care about social doctrines.  
Just leave me alone. I pay my taxes. I just exist. I want freedom. I want to be who I am. I don’t want to be an anarchist, a socialist, or something else—  
a Democrat. I don’t want any of that. Just leave me alone." But if you have this mindset, you will not achieve freedom.  
Instead, you will become a spiritual slave. You will be brainwashed and enslaved. Let me explain why.  

First, let us consider what reality is. I mentioned earlier that different myths—now often called narratives—shape our understanding of the world.  
There is a book by Klaus Schwab titled *The Great Narrative*, in which he argues that everything will revolve around this narrative: ecology, inclusive capitalism, digitalization, and so on.  
But this is just another "ism," another ideology, another form of propaganda—another myth, if you will.  

The truth is that any myth is related to some real phenomenon. It takes a phenomenon and tries to explain it in a comprehensive, easily understandable way.  
It tells you why things work the way they do, who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are. It exploits your inner demons—selfishness, self-righteousness, self-reliance, self-pity.  
It exploits your self-interest to make you accept this framework, this myth.  

Meanwhile, others may receive a different version of the myth or a completely different myth altogether.  
They may be told that *you* are the bad guy, and they must destroy you.  
People live according to these myths, and as a result, they destroy one another.  
We see countless examples of this today. The world is descending into all kinds of wars—between nations, civil wars, even conflicts within families.  
People are divided. Even the ideology of consumerism is a myth that divides families, leading people to quarrel, sue one another, and even kill each other.  

Why does this happen? Because of a story—a myth—that tells us if we have a lot of money, we can buy this or that, drive a Mercedes-Benz, show it off to our girlfriend, and feel happy.  
It’s all nonsense, but people believe it. They spend their money, their lives, chasing fake goals.  
They are even willing to harm their own relatives to achieve these goals.  

Myths are dangerous because they are not separate from reality. They are stories about reality, but the storyteller is the devil himself.  
In Greek, the word for devil is *Diabolos* (in Spanish, *Diablo*). *Diabolos* comes from the verb *diaballo*, which means "to slander."  
But its meaning is broader than just slander. *Diaballo* means "to throw through"—*dia* (through) and *ballo* (to throw).  
It’s about throwing meanings from one place to another, distorting reality.  

Slander itself is a form of storytelling. You might say, "I saw that person go into that building. Do you know why? He’s meeting with crooks or engaging in immoral activities."  
You believe this story, and you begin to hate that person. This is how the devil’s scheme works.  

To be clear, any myth out there comes from the devil. There is no such thing as an "orthodox" myth.  
Even when people claim there is—like the myth of Moscow as the "Third Rome" or some Byzantine myth—it is still a distortion, a tool of deception.

Those myths, even when they are called "orthodox," also come from the devil. They bring destruction and suffering to millions of people.  
The Lord Jesus Christ did not participate in the myth of a great Israel that must recapture the promised land or gain world power.  
He rejected such narratives.  

This brings us to the question: What is reality?  
Reality is not merely what you can touch or measure with scientific instruments.  
While these things are real, their importance is not absolute.  
Yes, the physical world exists, but it is not as valuable or meaningful to the Lord unless it is connected to spiritual reality.  
This is where true importance lies.  

What, then, is spiritual reality? It is what we grasp from the Lord Himself.  
"Take up your cross and follow Me." "Store up treasures in heaven."  
These treasures are far more real than any earthly possessions—a new iPhone, a Mercedes-Benz, a Lamborghini, or anything else.  
The treasures in heaven are the true reality.  

This is why the Lord says, "Do not worry about what you will eat or drink. Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you."  
Your primary goal must be the kingdom of heaven, its righteousness, and its truth.  
This is objective reality. The Lord Himself is the reality.  

Of course, we are not monotheists or Gnostics who reject the world entirely.  
We recognize that this world also carries the Lord’s blessing.  
However, we must see the priorities clearly.  
When we align our priorities correctly, the Lord will help us avoid all those myths and fake narratives imposed upon us.  

We see these narratives in the news, in magazines, and in the minds of everyone we meet—even our family members.  
But we must remain immune to these fake realities, fake narratives, and fake interpretations.  
They come from the devil, who seeks to destroy souls.  
He promotes narratives like childless families, the rejection of family, or the normalization of immoral lifestyles.  
These are all myths, distortions of reality.  

When people live by these myths, they create a relative reality—a reality built upon something already relative.  
This makes it even less real, a fragile construct that ultimately leads to destruction.  

Let us be aware of the devil’s deceit. Let us cling to Christ, put effort into our spiritual lives, and emphasize the treasures of heaven.  
Let us not crave or depend on anything relative or worldly, for these things enslave us, destroy souls, and ruin lives.  

May the Lord help us, bless us, grant us His wisdom, and keep us in His holiness.  
Amen. God bless.
