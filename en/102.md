# Christian view on Elections

Dear brothers and sisters, this year we have many elections in various countries. There are unplanned elections in Canada, and elections for the Russian parliament are coming soon. This raises the question: how should Christians approach these events? As citizens, we are first and foremost citizens of heaven. How should we engage with politics and the elections we are called to participate in?

Today, I will not delve into politics itself, but I want to discuss the spiritual aspects of the political system we have. As you know, politics can be a very dirty game. Politicians often feel compelled to speak negatively about their opponents, to glorify themselves, and to present themselves as saviors. This behavior carries a spirit of Antichrist. They promise to save people, build hospitals, increase pension plans, and offer many other benefits. They claim to save people from various threats, such as the coronavirus or other crises. In doing so, they present themselves as saviors, which is inherently Antichristian.

Moreover, they make promises they know they cannot keep. This is deceit, and deceit originates from the devil. In today's political climate, it seems impossible to engage in politics without being influenced by these negative forces. The spirit of Antichrist and the devil are behind much of what we see in politics. This is why, during elections, we often witness a spectacle of clowns vying for attention, arguing with each other, and making extravagant promises. This distracts people from what is truly important and shifts focus to the trivial.

Politicians use various tactics to gain support. For instance, they may promote a green agenda to appear virtuous, while secretly aiming to undermine small businesses. These strategies are deceptive, dishonest, and self-serving. To succeed in politics, one must often be extremely selfish and arrogant.

When we examine the platforms and programs of different political parties, we find that none of them embody the truth. For example, liberals may claim to advocate for the people, which sounds good, but this often comes with promoting certain ideologies or policies that may not align with Christian values. Conservatives, on the other hand, may emphasize traditional values, but this can also mean supporting corporate control over resources and advocating for lower taxes, which may not benefit everyone equally. It's all very complex, and you won't find a party that truly seeks to do God's will. Such a party does not exist.

These parties are often tools for those who wield real power. When certain agendas need to be pushed, specific parties are allowed to gain more influence. Once they have achieved their goals, they may be replaced by another party to implement unpopular measures. This is a cycle of manipulation and brainwashing. The true power brokers remain hidden, operating behind the scenes. They control the system, setting the guidelines and rules that govern political parties. These underlying structures change much more slowly than the leaders who come and go.

Furthermore, the individuals who possess vast wealth, financial resources, minerals, or control over armies are the ones who truly hold power. They are not elected, and their identities are often unknown to the public. Regardless of which party comes to power, these individuals will retain their influence. They are the ones who ultimately control the political landscape.

In conclusion, as Christians, we must navigate the political world with discernment, recognizing the spiritual forces at play and remaining focused on our ultimate citizenship in heaven.

So, these politicians are increasingly becoming like actors—take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, the former governor of California. They choose actors because they need performers for these positions. Politics is becoming more of a show, where real decisions are not made by these figureheads. The more a politician acts like a puppet, the more support they receive from those who pull the strings behind the scenes. Essentially, the entire system is very fake and deeply anti-Christian. But why is it like this?

We can look to the Holy Scripture for insight. In ancient times, Israel was governed by judges—charismatic leaders like Samson and Gideon, who were often anointed by prophets. These judges received their mission from God and led the Israelites, guiding them to victory in wars and other challenges. However, the people of Israel eventually grew dissatisfied with this system. They said, "We want a king, not these judges. Today we have a judge, but tomorrow we might not. For 20 years, we might be left vulnerable, and someone could conquer us. It’s too unstable. We want a king who will provide stability, prosperity, and a strong military. We want a king whose son will succeed him, creating a lasting system."

God responded to this demand by saying, "They want a king because they no longer want Me to be their King." This was a form of apostasy—a step away from God. Despite His displeasure, God allowed them to have a king. They were given Saul, a tyrannical and despotic ruler. Later, they had David and Solomon, who were better, but this marked the end of the era of judges and the beginning of the era of kings. This system of kings and emperors continued, with some variations, through much of history. Even during the Roman Republic, the concept of centralized leadership persisted.

This system of kings and emperors lasted until the modern era, when bourgeois revolutions in Europe began to overthrow monarchies. The English Revolution in the 17th century was a key turning point, and gradually, most of Europe and the world moved away from monarchies. Today, while a few kings remain, their power is largely symbolic. Most of the world now operates under so-called democracies, with some totalitarian states mixed in. Even where kings exist, they hold little real power.

So, what is democracy? It represents another step away from God. This is why it often feels so corrupt and anti-Christian in nature. Democracy distances humanity further from divine authority. In the past, a king had a spiritual role—he was seen as a father figure, anointed by God. People felt a moral responsibility and loyalty to him. If a king was bad, it was seen as a punishment from God, and the people would repent, pray, and strive to live better lives in hopes of receiving a better ruler in the future. There was an understanding of obedience and divine order.

But in a democracy, people reject this idea of obedience. They seek vainglory, believing they have a say in who leads them. Elections give the illusion of participation, as if individuals are deciding the fate of their nation. This is rooted in the same pride that the devil tempted humanity with: "You will be like gods." People now think they can take on the responsibilities and functions of God, deciding their own destiny. Of course, in reality, they have little control, but the illusion of participation creates a false sense of power.

This shift has widened the gap between God and humanity. By rejecting the idea of a divinely appointed leader and embracing the illusion of self-governance, society has moved further from divine authority. Democracy, in its current form, reflects this spiritual distance, making it a system that often feels disconnected from God’s will and purpose.

Indeed, the modern political system reflects a profound departure from God. In the past, God was seen as the ultimate authority, and leaders were viewed as His instruments, whether they were judges, kings, or prophets. There was a metaphysical and moral relationship between the people, their leaders, and God. However, in today's so-called democratic systems, this relationship has been severed. God has been relegated to the realm of personal belief, something optional and disconnected from public life. The political system operates as if it exists independently of divine authority, with leaders seen as mere mortals—no different from the rest of us. If we don't like them, we simply replace them. This reflects a worldview where humanity seeks to govern itself without reference to God, breaking the spiritual and moral framework that once guided societies.

This shift represents a global-scale apostasy, a turning away from God. Democracy, as it is practiced today, embodies this departure. It promises empowerment and participation, but in reality, it fosters pride and self-reliance, echoing the devil's temptation: "You will be like gods." People are deceived into thinking they have control over their destiny, but in truth, they are often manipulated by unseen forces. The political system is run by shadowy figures behind the scenes—individuals who remain hidden but wield immense power. This aligns with the biblical principle that when people reject God, He allows them to be handed over to another master. In this case, that master is Mammon, the spirit of materialism and greed, which is ultimately controlled by the devil.

The fruits of this system reveal its true nature. Over the past 150 years, the world has undergone dramatic changes, many of which reflect the influence of Mammon. The political system promised peace, prosperity, and progress, but the reality is far more complex. While some regions have experienced relative peace, others have been plagued by continuous conflict. Moreover, the absence of war does not necessarily indicate moral improvement. In fact, it often allows people to indulge in sin without facing the consequences, leading them further away from God.

Economically, the system has delivered material wealth, but this has come at a spiritual cost. In developed countries, fewer people go hungry, and material comforts abound. However, this wealth has not brought people closer to God. Instead, it has made them more self-reliant and less concerned with spiritual matters. As Jesus warned, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 19:24). The pursuit of wealth and comfort has become a distraction, drawing people away from prayer, morality, and the teachings of the Bible.

Now, the system offers "sustainable development" as its latest promise. On the surface, it sounds noble, but in reality, it often serves as a guise for depopulation, digitalization, and the creation of an electronic prison system. Total control, loss of privacy, and the erosion of individual freedoms are the true outcomes of this agenda. The devil, as always, is a deceiver. Just as he tricked humanity in the past by promising stability under kings, he now lures people with the illusion of progress and sustainability under democracy.

In essence, the political system we see today is a manifestation of humanity's rejection of God. It is built on pride, materialism, and deception, all of which are tools of the devil. As Christians, we must recognize this reality and remain vigilant. We must not be swayed by the false promises of this world but instead keep our focus on God and His kingdom. The true battle is not against flesh and blood but against the spiritual forces of evil (Ephesians 6:12). Our ultimate allegiance must always be to God, not to the fleeting and corrupt systems of this world.

The fruits of the modern political and societal system are indeed evident when we look back over the past 150 years. The moral decline is stark. Families, once the cornerstone of society, are now fractured. Values like loyalty, honesty, and selflessness have been replaced by personal gain, egoism, and a host of destructive ideologies. Religion, which once provided a moral and spiritual foundation, has been pushed aside. Cathedrals stand empty, repurposed or abandoned, as people turn away from prayer and faith. Instead, many embrace occultism, New Age spirituality, or simply reject religion altogether.

The rise of digitalization and virtual worlds has further disconnected people from reality. Many escape into video games, social media, and other digital distractions, living in a fantasy world devoid of responsibility. This has led to a decline in critical thinking and education. People no longer read literature or engage in deep, autonomous thought. Instead, they rely on quick Google searches and regurgitate whatever they hear in the media. The result is a population that is increasingly uninformed, uneducated, and easily manipulated.

Culture, once a reflection of a society's values and aspirations, has been eroded. What remains is a postmodern pseudo-culture that often glorifies the absurd and the immoral. True culture, rooted in tradition, beauty, and meaning, has been largely lost. These are the fruits of a system that prioritizes materialism, individualism, and instant gratification over spiritual and moral growth.

This decline is directly related to the way people live and the systems they embrace. In the past, societies were often structured around hierarchical models, such as the family or the church, where there was a clear sense of order, loyalty, and obedience. Today, we live in what can be described as an ochlocracy—a rule by the mob—or, more accurately, a satanocracy, where the devil and the spirit of Antichrist exert influence behind the scenes. Many of those in power are driven by occultism, psychopathy, and a desire for control. Through these individuals, the devil seeks to dominate humanity, leading us closer to the end times.

However, as Christians, we must not be afraid. Instead, we must be wise and discerning, understanding the times we live in and the forces at work. We must not be deceived by the empty promises of politicians, who offer only earthly rewards—peace, health, wealth, and liberty. While these things are not inherently bad, they are not the ultimate good for Christians. Our priority is not material prosperity but spiritual growth and drawing closer to God. Sometimes, this may involve enduring hardship or poverty, as these trials can refine our faith and bring us closer to Him.

We must remember the words of Psalm 146:3, "Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save." Salvation does not come from political leaders or systems but from the Lord. This does not mean we should disengage entirely from the political process, but we must approach it with spiritual wisdom, recognizing its limitations and keeping our ultimate trust in God.

May the Lord grant us discernment, strength, and peace as we navigate these challenging times. Let us remain steadfast in our faith, focused on what truly matters, and trust in God's ultimate plan. Amen.
