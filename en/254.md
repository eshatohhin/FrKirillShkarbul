# How “to pass from life to Life”

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about the mystery, the mystery of life after life.  
First of all, let us turn to Scripture. This is from the First Letter to the Corinthians, chapter 2, verse 9:  
*"As it is written: 'Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.'"*  

For those who love the Lord, there is no judgment. They pass from life to life. This is the highest possible outcome, the best possible fulfillment of the Christian life—that we do not even have to undergo judgment. We do not believe in the notion of waiting, of weighing merits and punishments, or any of these scholastic concepts. The Orthodox Church has always held that it is about the heart of man—how open it is to the Lord, how deeply it has embraced the Gospel.  

In the Bible itself, we read that this life is the seed, and the life after death is the fruit. In Galatians 6:7-8, it is written: *"Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."* Already here, in this life, we begin to reap these fruits, though now it is as though through a glass dimly—not so clear, not so full. We can lose it at any time. But at the end of this life, we will gain full union with Christ.  

The departure of a Christian—what we call repose or dormition—is like a sleep. The dormition of a Christian, any member of the Christian community, is a festival, a celebration, a great feast. When someone has departed, it means they have completed their struggle, their challenge. They have passed through this life and accomplished what the Lord desired of them. Now, they enjoy their reward in full liberation—complete freedom, for there is no more sin, no more passion. Every Christian hopes to attain this, which is why death is sometimes called the "second baptism." Though we believe in one baptism for the remission of sins, this is an analogy, a metaphor, for death also births us into eternal life in Christ, with Christ.  

Even now, in monasteries and monastic communities, when a brother passes away, it is a time of celebration. There are feasts, processions, and joyful chanting. The brethren share stories of how the departed prayed, lived ascetically, and served God. It is a profoundly joyful moment. The holy fathers teach that if you fear death, if you avoid thinking about it, if you feel negatively toward it, it is a sign that you are still far from Christ. If you are close to Christ, death is not an issue.  

The ancient ascetic Neilos once said that we should expect death every day, yet not fear it. These two virtues go hand in hand and reveal how close or far we are from Christ. If you are afraid of death or avoid thinking about it, it means you are still distant from Him. Most of us are like this. Why? Because our spiritual eyes are still closed. We do not truly feel or know the goodness of God. We do not fully understand how to love Him, why we should love Him, or how deeply we are called to love Him. Intuitively, we sense the reality of hell and fear it.  

The demons that come to sinners are like extortionists of the soul, dragging it away. Yet, as Christ said in the Gospel of John (14:30): *"The prince of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me."*

What does this mean? Typically, we understand it to mean that Christ has nothing to do with the prince of this world—they have different agendas, different goals, and no cooperation. However, there is another layer of meaning: within Christ Himself, there is nothing that belongs to the prince of this world. This is why, when Christ died, death could not hold Him. He rose in glory, ascended into heaven, and nothing could stop Him.  

In us, however, it is different. Every passion, every sin, every blemish we carry is something that belongs to the prince of this world. Bad habits, addictions, impure thoughts—all of these are like a snake that has entered our soul and taken up residence. Whether it is anger, gluttony, lust, hatred, envy, vainglory, or anything else, these belong to the prince of this world. This is why, when a person dies, the demons come and say, "We need to take what is ours. This soul belongs to us; this is our property." They are like toll collectors, extortioners, or chasers, always counting what we owe them.  

This is also why, historically, professions like banking were viewed with suspicion. Bankers, in a sense, mirrored the actions of demons by demanding repayment and collecting debts.  

I bring this up now because recently, our brother in Christ from China passed away. His passing holds profound lessons for us, and I must admit, I feel a kind of holy jealousy about the way he died—jealousy in the best sense. He died the day before he was to be baptized, on the Friday of the Week of the Veneration of the Cross, a very holy week in the Church. Friday, the day of Christ’s crucifixion, was the day before his baptism.  

He had been preparing earnestly for baptism. He prayed daily, read Scripture, fasted rigorously, and abstained from food entirely. Some slanderers have claimed, "This is why he died; the Church taught him to fast to death, so you are to blame." But this is a temptation from the devil. No one dies from two or three days of fasting. He died on the third day of a strict fast, during which he consumed no food at all. This was not something we taught him; it was his own decision. Orthodox practice recommends a vegetarian fast (no meat, dairy, eggs, or fish) for three days before baptism, but he took it much further, choosing to abstain from all food.  

In the week leading up to his death, we held classes, and he attended every session. He left a deep impression on me as the most pious of all the students. He grasped every word of prayer, delved into the details of our lectures, and showed a profound interest in spirituality. He even brought his children with him. His joy was evident when I gave him holy icons and prayer ropes. It was remarkable to witness such eagerness, kindness, and humility in him.  

Yet, his life before this was marked by struggle. He had been searching for faith, engaging in disputes with various sects, and seeking the truth. His family life was fraught with difficulties, and he endured great pain, even having to leave his home at one point. This suffering drove him to pray with such earnestness and sincerity.

I believe he found the true faith precisely because he endured so many challenges. It was as though his soul was being cleansed through his trials. The Lord, in His wisdom, decided that he had endured enough—his pain and struggles had served their purpose. Now was the perfect time for him to be taken into the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Lord called him home.  

When he passed away, I observed something remarkable. In my years as a priest, I have conducted many funeral services, and often the faces of the departed are covered because they bear expressions of terror, horror, or gloom—reflecting the anguish they experienced before death. But with him, it was different. His face radiated joy, even a faint smile. He died with his hands in a posture of prayer, falling backward as if in the act of worship. I believe he was praying when he died.  

While we must avoid being overly emotional or speculative, and we cannot declare him a saint—such recognition takes years and requires clear signs confirmed by the Church—there are indications of his blessed state. In the early Church, all departed Christians were referred to as "blessed," for they had entered the celebration of the Kingdom. In this sense, I can say with confidence that he is blessed.  

In his final days, he was free from sin—no quarrels, no accusations, no wrongdoing. He prayed from morning to night, fasted diligently, and even took his children to school before returning home to pass away. When there is no evidence of a person dying in a state of sin—such as drunkenness or prolonged absence from the Church—we can have hope for their soul. With him, I believe we can be reasonably certain that he was received by the angels into heaven.  

This is why I feel a holy jealousy—a good jealousy—for the way he was taken. He departed during holy days, in a holy state of life, and in a manner that reflected his deep devotion. For most of us, our initial fervor for Christ, the Church, and spirituality often wanes over time. We begin with great excitement, eagerly praying, fasting, and reading the lives of the saints. But after two years, five years, or even twenty years, we may grow complacent, thinking, "Nothing special is happening. I’m a Christian; I go to church sometimes. It’s okay."  

This complacency is a grave sin. In Revelation, the Lord rebukes the Church of Ephesus, saying, *"I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first"* (Revelation 2:4). He also warns the Church of Laodicea, *"Because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth"* (Revelation 3:16). Our first love for Christ must remain strong and grow deeper over time. The Lord blesses those who are *"hungry and thirsty for righteousness"* (Matthew 5:6), and this hunger must persist throughout our lives.  

This is why I believe our brother is blessed, and I hope the same for all of us. To cultivate this deep desire for sanctity and life in Christ, we must learn repentance. As King David said, *"I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me"* (Psalm 51:3). When we continually recognize our sinfulness, it drives us to seek God, to chase after Him, to immerse ourselves in Scripture, to pray fervently, and to serve others selflessly.  

Let us strive to maintain that first love, to remain vigilant, and to hunger for righteousness always. In doing so, we too may be counted among the blessed.

This is what opens the way for the Holy Spirit to move within us, giving us direction and strength to continue the struggle. In Greek, this struggle is called *agon*, and we must remain on this path every day of our lives.  

There is a story about two sons who came to their father. He told them, "There is a field, and on a special day, if you work in it, you will receive great treasures. If you work on that day, you will not have to work for the rest of your life." The sons asked, "What day is that?" The father replied, "I have forgotten. But there is one such day in the year."  

So, the sons worked hard every day of the year, expecting that day to come. At the end of the year, they returned and said, "We worked all year, but nothing happened." The father said, "Let us try again next year." They worked diligently for another year, but again, the special day did not come. However, by then, they realized they no longer needed that day. The two years of hard labor had brought them enough resources and taught them how to work. They had grown to love labor itself.  

The father then explained, "This is a parable for the spiritual life. You must work for the Lord every day, expecting each day to be your last. If you live this way, when your last day comes, you will be ready, like our brother Gregory. And by then, you will have accumulated great treasures that will accompany you into eternity."  

Let us remember this lesson and learn from the example of our brother Gregory. Let us pray for the repose of his soul and ask for his prayers on our behalf. In these days of Great Lent, we should reflect deeply on the end of life. The Lord’s life is about to reach its culmination during Holy Week—He will be crucified and die. We, too, must be ready to die with Him.  

May we not fear death. Instead, may we, through the grace of our Lord, overcome the devil, evil, and death. May we be found faithful, having lived each day as though it were our last, and may we accumulate the treasures of a life lived in Christ.  

God bless you, my brothers and sisters.
