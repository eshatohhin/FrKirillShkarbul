# How to learn to love Christ and to live a holy life

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am once again in Kaohsiung, the large city in southern Taiwan, and I want to share with you a message about faith. I want to discuss what should be the greatest aim for each of us, something we often lose sight of.

Just yesterday, we reflected on the parable of the sower. The sower scattered seeds, which fell on different types of ground, and only some bore fruit. When the seed fell on poor ground, it did not yield anything. However, when it fell on good soil, it produced a bountiful harvest—thirty, sixty, or even a hundredfold. We have all heard this parable many times, and it seems straightforward. The Lord Himself explained it, so no further interpretation is needed. Yet, it is crucial to consider how this applies to our daily lives.

In our daily lives, we often find ourselves far from nurturing this seed. We are distracted by countless things, worried about many matters, and fearful of what might happen. We experience stress, depression, and strong desires—whether to acquire possessions, enter relationships, or pursue other worldly goals. As a result, we drift far from growing in the love of Christ.

This happens because we live in a world filled with deceit and passions. We become part of the generation we are born into, shaped by its values. Though society appears individualistic, with everyone seemingly free and independent, people are actually divided into various groups. Marketers understand this well, targeting specific demographics—students, mothers, the elderly—with tailored messages. This is why sociology has become one of the primary tools of the Antichrist. While complete control over every individual is impossible, the Antichrist has largely succeeded in creating trends that influence us.

To overcome this deceit, the key is to learn to love Christ with all our hearts. The saints we know always stood apart from the paradigms of their societies, even in supposedly Christian or Orthodox communities. The Church recognizes these individuals as saints precisely because they were different—they were not like the majority. Their "strangeness" is a sign that the seed of God's Word had taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in them.

Therefore, we must make it our life's goal to remain steadfast on the path to salvation, striving for daily sanctity and drawing closer to Christ. We must aim to become saints and inspire those around us—our relatives and loved ones. As long as we, and those close to us, are not on this path, we cannot afford to relax and assume everything is fine, as if we are merely following God's plan. No, we are engaged in a spiritual battle, and the first step begins with us. If we can break free from these societal paradigms, even one person can have a profound impact on society and the world.

This is a fact. We often think that big trends, corporations, and media control everything, but in reality, they are nothing. When we commit to the path of sanctity and learn to love Christ with our whole hearts, we realize that it only takes a few individuals to bring about change—and we can be among them. The more firmly we walk this path, the greater the impact we can have.

So let us think deeply: What is wrong with me? Why am I so distracted by my passions and other things? I need to break away from the value systems imposed on me—through education, society, and even family—that tell me I need to earn more, buy more, achieve comfort, go on frequent vacations, and fulfill countless other desires. These are like commands or algorithms programmed into my mind, and I must rid myself of them.

The Lord said, "Blessed are those who mourn." Why mourn? And yet, the Apostle Paul tells us to be joyful, exceedingly glad, and happy. These ideas go hand in hand. We mourn because we see how far we are from Christ and how those around us hold wrong values. We see people wasting their lives, harming themselves, and destroying their futures. We mourn for humanity’s weakness and corruption, for its misguided desires and wasted potential. We pray for others, feeling compassion for them. At the same time, we are joyful because we experience the resurrection power of Christ working within us, saving us, guiding us, and giving us light and motivation.

The more we love Christ, the more we resemble the early Christians, who were so deeply in love with Him that they drew fish symbols everywhere as a sign of their faith. Their love for Christ was not romantic but authentic, healthy, and life-giving. They shared this love with others, enduring immense suffering in the process. The sorrows we face are temptations that deepen our faith. In the parable of the sower, the seeds that fell on rocky ground lacked depth. Similarly, the depth of our faith is measured by the sorrows we can withstand. Often, we fail daily, succumbing to small temptations and betraying Christ through sin or falling into sorrows not from God.

There is a godly sorrow that leads to repentance and a sorrow from the devil or our flesh that brings a taste of death, leaving us gloomy, negative, and depressed. We must grow deeper, making the soil of our hearts richer, so we can withstand greater challenges and temptations. The Lord said, "Whomever I love, I discipline." He allows us to face sorrows because He cares for us and has hope in us. These trials refine us, drawing us closer to Christ through daily sacrifices, breaking away from our old selves, and losing our lives to gain true life.

We must also break away from the idols of our desires—all the goals and ambitions I mentioned earlier. The main goal of our lives should be to love Christ. Why don’t I love Him? What does it mean to love Him? How can I make myself love Him more? The Apostle Paul reminds us that we were bought with a great price and should not become slaves to men or burden ourselves with debts to acquire properties, cars, or material possessions. We must not rely too much on things, the internet, or anything else, as these could become tools of control.

Let us make this our task, understanding how difficult it is, even in good times. Even in Orthodox countries, where the majority of people were Orthodox, where prayers were abundant and resources plentiful, it was still a challenge. Yet, we must strive to love Christ with all our hearts, breaking free from the world’s distractions and focusing on the path to sanctity.

But even in those times, it was a very small minority who truly walked this path. Now, it is even smaller and far more difficult to follow. Let us grow firmer and firmer on this path, making it our daily goal to cleanse ourselves of all wrong ideas and desires, ensuring that dark temptations do not take root in our hearts. We must cast away all those nests of sin and distraction, so that the soil of our hearts may be fertile and ready to grow the seed of God’s Word.

May the Lord help us, grant us His joy, strengthen our faith, enlighten us, and kindle the fire of faith in our hearts. May He give us the joy of His salvation and guide us as we strive to walk this narrow but glorious path. Amen.
