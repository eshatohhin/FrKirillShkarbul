# Spiritual sleep & blindness pulls the world into new trap

Dear brothers and sisters, very soon I will embark on a mission, and I will primarily share videos about this mission. However, before I do, I want to share my overall feelings about what is happening in the world and within the Church. The world continues to exist because of the Church. The Lord cares deeply about the Church, and everything is connected to His divine plan on Earth.

If we only talk about our activities, our mission, and our gatherings, it might seem as though we are isolated in a tower, discussing things detached from the real world. However, it is crucial to understand that just as the Lord was fully aware of the world's problems, we too should be aware of what is happening around us and the risks involved. This awareness is not the most important aspect of following Christ, but it is relevant to everyone around us—our relatives, friends, and fellow parishioners. Everyone is affected.

By understanding the current state of the Church, we can better comprehend where we are inviting people when we evangelize. We invite them to join the Church, but we must be clear that it is not a utopia. The Church is not a place of perfection; it is a community of people striving to be with the Lord, though they often fall short. St. Nicholas of Serbia once said that in the early Church, it was exceptional for a faithful person not to lead a holy life. However, in the end times, it will be the opposite—it will be exceptional to find a holy person among the faithful. This is the era we live in, and we witness this reality daily.

This does not mean the Church is fake or that the Lord is distant or weaker. His power remains unchanged, and we can receive as much grace as He is willing to give, provided we open our hearts to it. The issue lies within us, not with the Lord. Therefore, do not be disheartened if the Church today does not seem as strong, powerful, or spiritual as it was during the time of the ecumenical councils.

Now, let's turn our attention to the world and the ongoing war. How does this conflict fit into the bigger picture? You know which war I am referring to. The first thing I want to emphasize is that humanity as a whole is spiritually weaker, sick, and asleep—this includes most Christians and even Orthodox believers. For instance, compare university graduates from 200 years ago, whether from top universities in Germany, Russia, or any other country, to today's graduates. The former were far more knowledgeable, had clear goals, and could think independently. Today, many graduates seem like a group of teenagers who lack direction and capability, with only a few exceptions who still fall short in various ways.

Why do we no longer have great philosophers or composers like Mozart or Bach? Even our politicians pale in comparison to figures like Churchill or past US presidents. It seems as though everything is in decline, becoming almost a parody of what it once was. Younger generations struggle to study, rely heavily on their parents, and moral values continue to erode. In many ways, our times are marked by a decline in strength, capability, moral integrity, intellectual power, and independence. People are easily manipulated by the news and social media, where they spend much of their time.

In conclusion, while the world and the Church face significant challenges, we must remain steadfast in our faith and continue to seek the Lord's grace. The problems we see are not a reflection of His absence or weakness but rather a call for us to open our hearts and strive for holiness in these trying times.

So, we can also draw comparisons within the Church. The era of the Holy Fathers lasted until the 7th or 8th century, and then it came to an end. Since then, we have had some outstanding theological thinkers, but the brilliance of that earlier period has not been matched. Why is this the case? Different epochs bring different challenges. The spiritual and intellectual vigor of the Church has waned over time. Even among theologians, we no longer see the same depth and prominence as we did 50 years ago. In many ways, the Church is growing weaker—whether in the quality of the priesthood, the leadership of bishops, or the overall testimony of Christ. However, I do not wish to be entirely pessimistic.

While we must acknowledge these broader trends, we can also recognize that in every generation, there are saints—individuals who rise above their circumstances, whether in Orthodox, pagan, or Muslim countries. If they remain faithful to Orthodoxy, they can achieve holiness. This means that on an individual level, you and I, and every person, have the capacity to resist these negative trends. We do not have to follow the broader decline. As we will see, even the Antichrist, described as the "genius of geniuses," does not conform to these trends. He will deceive many, but that is a topic for another time.

When an organism grows weak, sickness breaks through. The war we are witnessing today is a manifestation of this spiritual sickness, a result of our collective weakness. It is not that Russians or Ukrainians are inherently more spiritually sick than others; rather, the devil has chosen this moment and place to sow division and destruction. He could have done so elsewhere, but this is where God has allowed it to unfold. What could bring the devil greater joy than seeing Orthodox Christians killing one another? It is a tragic fulfillment of his desire to see the Church tear itself apart.

The devil, like a prowling lion, seeks to devour those who are vulnerable. Sadly, it is not difficult for him to achieve this. How does this happen? What is the mechanism? It begins when political, ideological, or even pseudo-patriotic concerns take root in our hearts. Slowly, these worldly concerns fill the empty spaces where Christ should reside. Instead of focusing on how best to serve Christ, we become preoccupied with careers, ambitions, and worldly interests. Even as Orthodox Christians, we often become entangled in these distractions. Over time, this worldly logic leads us to a point where we are handed a machine gun and told, "Go and kill, for they are the enemy." By then, we have no choice, because we have been spiritually asleep all along.

This is why such tragedies occur. I speak from personal experience, having been to this war in 2014, 2015, and 2016. I have seen it firsthand, not through the lens of news or secondhand stories. I witnessed the lies on both sides and the devastating consequences of spiritual weakness. The war is a symptom of a deeper sickness, one that can only be healed by returning to Christ and rejecting the empty distractions of this world.

And while people go and kill each other, someone behind the scenes is delighted—thrilled that this chaos continues. He is willing to let it persist for as long as necessary. 

We have countless examples of this pattern throughout history, beginning with the Old Testament. People fell spiritually asleep, began worshiping Baal, and the grace of the Lord departed. Then came the Babylonians, who destroyed the temple, killed many, and enslaved the rest. Only a few prophets remained, crying out, "Repent!" 

In the Church, we see the same pattern. The Western part of the Orthodox Church fell into spiritual slumber, leading to what we now call the Dark Ages. They slept in darkness, and eventually, they split away into heresy, becoming the Roman Catholic Church. In Russia, the Orthodox Church also fell asleep in the 16th century, leading to the great schism of the 17th century. This caused immense stress for the Church, with many splitting away, and the Church becoming weaker and more entangled with the government. 

Again, the Church slept, and Napoleon invaded, delivering another devastating blow. The 19th century passed in spiritual slumber, culminating in the Bolshevik Revolution, where communists, Marxists, and socialists nearly destroyed the faith and the Church. This, too, was a result of spiritual sleep. 

The 20th century saw more slumber, and the devil sowed division between Russians and Ukrainians, laying the groundwork for the current war. Then came Perestroika, which reopened churches, but instead of awakening, people fell back into sleep, consumed by materialism and the allure of consumerism. The free market economy took hold, and no one noticed the spiritual shift. 

Now, we face the next level of this sickness—the rise of the Antichrist and widespread apostasy. The current war is not merely the work of politicians or secret governments. The deeper issue is that we have been spiritually asleep, failing to notice the gradual erosion of our faith and values. 

This pattern is not unique to one nation. The Greeks, too, fell asleep in the 20th century, succumbing to American postmodernism and post-Christian influences. Today, young people in Greece reject the Church, not because of persecution, but because they were spiritually neglected and brainwashed by secular ideologies. The same is true, and often worse, in the post-Christian world at large. 

We must understand why this happens and what is unfolding around us. We must pray that we, ourselves, do not fall asleep and that those around us may awaken. Times of crisis, like war, can serve as a wake-up call. This war affects the entire world—energy prices rise, food becomes scarce, and people are forced to confront reality. Perhaps now, they will begin to think and awaken. 

Let us pray that the Lord saves us from this evil. It will not resolve itself. Only if each of us awakens can we resist this darkness and bear witness to Christ. Those who come to faith through mission work must find a healthier Church—a community living in truth, not entangled in political agendas. Let us strive to be that Church, awake and vigilant, shining the light of Christ in a darkening world.

When we see the world so polarized—where people are either "pro" or "contra," divided by ideologies and agendas—they may come to a church and ask, "What kind of church is this? These people are just like us." But the Church must not be like the world. We are called to stand with the Lord, not with political agendas or propaganda, no matter how convincing they may sound.

May the Lord grant us strength, wisdom, and love for everyone. May He give us strong faith to serve Him faithfully and to overcome all the deceptions of the devil. Let us remain steadfast in our devotion to Christ, resisting the pull of worldly divisions and remaining a beacon of His truth and grace. God bless us all.
