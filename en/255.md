# What do the Saints say about non-Orthodox

Dear brothers and sisters, recently I was asked to explain the Church's attitude towards Catholics, Protestants, and other people who call themselves Christians.  
This question is very important because we need to understand what the Church is. We must have a clear ecclesiological understanding of what the Church of Christ is, what it is not, and what it means.  

The spirit of ecumenism is now omnipresent, and there is a popular slogan that many embrace: "There is only one God." This slogan, however, is deceptive and aligns with the spirit of the antichrist. It suggests that it no longer matters how one approaches God, how one finds Him, or what one must do to enter into union with Him. The implication is that since there is only one God, all churches are the same, and it doesn't matter which one you follow.  

This idea extends to the belief that there is only one Son. Some claim it doesn't matter what you think about the Son—whether you believe He is God or not, whether you worship Him or not. But it absolutely matters what you know about God. If your understanding of God is false or based on illusion, then your entire spirituality will be counterfeit, and your prayers will be empty.  

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to know the true Lord. For the Church, throughout the centuries, the central mission has been to preserve the correct understanding of God so that we may love and worship the true God. It is impossible to love the true God if you do not know Him or, worse, if you hold false ideas about Him.  

We will see that the conception of God in Catholicism and Protestantism is fundamentally flawed—it is distorted and based on illusion. However, let us turn to what the saints and the holy councils of the Church have said about this matter. I do not want to rely solely on my own thoughts; I want to show you the revelation received by the holy men and councils of the Church regarding Catholicism and Protestantism.  

Some argue that since no ecumenical council has explicitly condemned Catholicism or Protestantism, we cannot label them as heresies. However, you will see that all the saints have referred to them as heresies. There is not a single saint who has claimed that Catholicism or Protestantism is not a heresy.  

Before delving deeper, I must address a significant problem within our own Orthodox community. We often wield the true faith as a weapon to attack others. We defend our faith not with love, as the Gospel teaches, but with methods reminiscent of paganism or Judaism—methods rooted in hatred, like those of the scribes who used the letter of the law to condemn and destroy. This is a grave perversion of the faith.  

Those who lack love are not truly Orthodox. Hatred and enmity have no place in the faith. We must distinguish between the person and the error they believe in or the sin they commit. We are called to love the person while condemning and rejecting the errors that come from the devil. It is out of love that we do not want others to fall into these errors and mistakes.  

Ecumenists, however, accuse us of hating people when we criticize their beliefs. They claim that our criticism stems from arrogance. This is not true. They conflate the person with their beliefs, and their so-called love is false. They claim to love people by approving of everything they believe or do, even if it is immoral. This is the liberal and ecumenist mindset, which, unfortunately, has also infiltrated the Orthodox Church.  

Within the Church, we see both ecumenist-minded individuals and zealots who adhere rigidly to the letter of the law. These zealots, like the scribes and Pharisees, harbor hatred and are quick to condemn anyone who does not conform to their strict interpretations. This, too, is a distortion of the faith.  

Let us strive to uphold the truth with love, distinguishing between the person and their errors, and guiding others toward the true faith with compassion and humility.

They love to talk about anathemas and condemnations, but we must avoid falling into either extreme. We seek to embody love while also understanding what the holy people—those who lived by faith and were guided by the Holy Spirit—had to say about Catholicism and Protestantism.  

After this introduction, let me delve into the matter. I will mention only a few examples, as there are too many to cover comprehensively.  

St. Photius of Constantinople spoke about the Latins, who, in his time, were beginning to drift away from the Church, though the formal schism had not yet occurred. He noted that they introduced lawless teachings into the faith, even distorting the Creed. Specifically, they propagated the false teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father but also from the Son. This distortion of the central dogma of the Holy Trinity, known as the *filioque*, is a blasphemy. It contradicts the Gospel, the teachings of the Church Fathers, and the decrees of the holy and ecumenical councils. This teaching is a direct affront to God, opposing the prophets, apostles, saints, martyrs, and even the words of Christ Himself. The voice of the Church, through its councils, condemns these teachings as contrary to divine revelation.  

St. Mark of Ephesus also affirmed that the Latins were separated from the Church because they are heretics. This is for those who claim we cannot label Catholics as heretics. The saints themselves declare it so.  

St. Gregory Palamas identified the *filioque* as a heretical teaching. Similarly, St. Simeon, Archbishop of Thessaloniki, stated that the Church has anathematized those who teach the *filioque*, expelling them from the Church for their blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  

St. Nicodemus of Mount Athos and St. Cosmas of Aetolia went further, calling the pope the antichrist and warning that he would lead humanity into apostasy. This is a prophetic warning about the future falling away from the faith, with the pope at its helm.  

St. Nectarius of Pentapolis and St. Theodosius of Kyiv urged the faithful to avoid those with distorted beliefs, warning against their teachings, customs, and communion. They emphasized the need to reject such errors entirely.  

Numerous councils have also condemned these teachings. The Council of Constantinople in 879 declared the *filioque* a heresy. Later councils, such as those in 1450, 1722, and 1838, condemned various Latin teachings as heretical. In 1848, a significant letter signed by four patriarchs addressed all Orthodox Christians, affirming that the *filioque*—the idea that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son—is a heresy, and all who adhere to it are heretics.  

Today, Catholics often claim that it doesn’t matter whether one says the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from the Father and the Son. This is a deception, as their faith has become secondary to their allegiance to the pope. For many, faith has been reduced to a political or organizational affiliation, stripped of its spiritual essence.  

Saints such as St. Theophan the Recluse, St. Ignatius Brianchaninov, and St. John of Kronstadt also unequivocally labeled Catholicism and Protestantism as heretical. While I cannot recount all their teachings here, rest assured that the consensus of the saints and councils is clear.  

Let us hold fast to the truth with love, rejecting error while praying for those who have strayed, that they may return to the true faith.

But now, some might argue, "Well, Protestants also criticize Catholicism, so perhaps Protestants are right." However, the Holy Fathers and the Orthodox Church affirm that Protestantism is an even greater and more harmful heresy than Catholicism.  

Catholicism laid the foundation for all future heresies by promoting a humanistic idea centered on one man—the pope—who claims to possess all truth and the authority to dispense it. The pope elevated himself above the holy councils and the Church, asserting that he alone receives divine revelation and has the exclusive power to interpret it.  

Protestantism, in turn, took this humanistic idea further. Protestants rejected the authority of the Church entirely, declaring that every individual has the right to interpret Scripture for themselves. They said, "We don’t need the Church’s teachings or any authority. We only need the Bible, and whatever we understand from it is the truth." This mindset shifted the source of truth from God to the individual, fostering a human-centered approach to faith.  

This rejection of authority and tradition led to the rise of humanism, where the individual becomes the ultimate arbiter of truth. Protestants claimed that they did not need the Church, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, or the collective wisdom of the saints. This attitude paved the way for a self-centered spirituality, where personal interpretation replaced divine revelation.  

The consequences of this were predictable. Fallen human nature, inclined toward serving the flesh, rejected any form of asceticism or self-discipline. Protestants dismissed monasticism, fasting, and other spiritual practices that restrain the flesh and purify the soul. They declared, "We don’t need any constraints on our flesh, mind, or reason. Whatever I think is true must be true."  

This rejection of asceticism and self-denial strikes at the very heart of Christianity, which calls us to take up our cross and follow Christ. Instead, many Protestants claim salvation without sacrifice, believing they are already saved and need not struggle against sin or evil. This is a dangerous illusion—a form of spiritual auto-suggestion where one declares, "I am saved. Hallelujah!" without any real transformation or effort.  

While Protestants rightly reject certain Catholic errors, such as the sale of indulgences, they go further by rejecting repentance, confession, fasting, and the ascetic struggle against sin. In doing so, they create an even more distorted version of Christianity, one that is far more damaging than the errors they sought to correct.  

St. Justin Popovich and other saints have written extensively on this topic. In his work *Notes on Ecumenism*, St. Justin explains how Protestantism’s emphasis on individual interpretation as the standard of truth laid the groundwork for rationalism, nihilism, Marxism, modernism, postmodernism, and atheism. This human-centered approach opened the door to the satanic philosophies that dominate Western society today.  

The Protestant rejection of authority and tradition has led to a world where truth is subjective, morality is relative, and faith is reduced to personal opinion. This mindset has spread globally, dragging humanity into spiritual and moral decay. The result is a society that no longer needs Christianity, as it has embraced materialism, hedonism, and self-worship.  

In one word, this is *mammonism*—the worship of wealth and self. It is a tragic departure from the true faith, leading countless souls into delusion and destruction. Let us remain steadfast in the Orthodox faith, holding fast to the teachings of the Church and the wisdom of the saints, so that we may avoid these errors and guide others toward the truth.

The roots of these errors run deep. The primary root lies in Catholicism, which gave rise to Protestantism and, subsequently, to countless sects and false philosophies. As St. Justin Popovich explains, both Catholicism and Protestantism are heresies because they serve as the foundation for all other heresies. Protestantism, in particular, takes these errors to their logical extreme, amplifying and expanding them.  

St. Ignatius Brianchaninov also warns us about the dangers of Protestantism. He notes that Martin Luther and his followers were vehement opponents of chastity. This is why they reject the perpetual virginity of the Most Holy Theotokos, propagating the blasphemous idea that she had relations after giving birth to the Lord. They also reject monasticism and all forms of self-discipline aimed at cultivating virtue. Instead, they embrace a lifestyle of indulgence and moral laxity.  

Furthermore, Protestants reject icons, holy relics, sacraments, and the entire tradition of the Church. They rely solely on individualistic interpretations of the Bible, which are often baseless and contrary to the teachings of the Holy Church. These errors are not mere differences of opinion; they constitute serious blasphemies against the Holy Spirit. By rejecting the fruits of the Holy Spirit in the Church—such as the sacraments, the veneration of saints, and the guidance of tradition—they cut themselves off from the life-giving grace of God.  

It is important to clarify that we are not condemning individuals who are sincerely seeking the truth. Many Protestants and Catholics are humble, open-minded, and earnestly searching for the truth. We do not label such people as heretics. In fact, we consider them to be like catechumens—those who are on the path to holy baptism and illumination in Christ. There is hope for their salvation, and indeed, many former Protestants and Catholics have found their way into the Orthodox Church.  

The fight for truth continues, and we must always distinguish between the person and their erroneous beliefs. The teachings of Catholicism and Protestantism are false and lead to corruption and sin, but the individuals who hold these beliefs are created in the image of God. The Lord desires the salvation of all, and we pray that they may come to the knowledge of the truth.  

In Titus 3:10-11, we are instructed to avoid a heretic after the first and second admonition, knowing that such a person is self-condemned. They are fixed in their errors and unwilling to listen to the truth. This does not mean we should approach them with hatred or arrogance. Rather, we must handle the truth of the Orthodox Church with care, like a fire that can bring warmth and light but can also cause harm if misused.  

We must resist the worldly spirit of political correctness that urges us to avoid calling heresy what it is. False kindness and fake love do no one any favors. Instead, let us study our faith deeply, live by it, and share it with humility and love. This is the true apostolic faith, the path to holiness.  

As St. Ignatius Brianchaninov observed, Protestantism has produced countless theologians but not a single saint. This is a sobering reminder that true faith is not about intellectual debate or personal interpretation but about living in communion with God and His Church. Let us hold fast to the Orthodox faith, which has been handed down to us by the saints, and strive to embody its truth in our lives.

It has not produced even a single saint, despite encompassing hundreds of millions of people over the centuries. The same can be said for Catholicism. This is a profound and sobering reality.  

Let us, therefore, remember this and strive to remain in union with the true Church. Let us progress in this union, growing in love, overcoming our old selves, and thirsting for the revelation of the Lord and His salvation. We are called to take up our cross and follow Him, to ascend with Him to Golgotha, and to enter into His eternal glory. Amen.  

May the Lord help and bless each one of us, dear brothers and sisters. Amen.
