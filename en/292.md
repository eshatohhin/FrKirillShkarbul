# Antichrist can’t come as long as there’s Mission

Dear brothers and sisters,

We are still celebrating Epiphany, and during this time, we reflect deeply on the heavens opening and the invitation extended to us to enter the kingdom of heaven. This marks the beginning of the end times. All the prophecies have been fulfilled, and now everyone is invited. The devil has been conquered, and there is nothing obstructing the testimony of the Gospel. The Lord is waiting for everyone to enter the bridal chamber and participate in this celebration with all who are called, who come, and who are worthy of this celebration.

Two weeks ago, I recorded a video about the seven churches of the Apocalypse. Of course, I presented just one interpretation of their meaning, which offers some clues about where we are, where we're going, the mission of the church now, the final end times, and what we should be prepared for. Over the past two weeks, I have given more thought to the question of the very last times, the coming of the Antichrist, and whether we should be preparing for that now, especially in light of the political changes happening around the world. My recent mission trips to China have provided new insights. In China, we see the devil attempting to hinder missionary work, as the Orthodox Church is illegal, and any form of mission work is prohibited. This serves as a stark reminder of the evil that emerged with the Satanist Bolsheviks in Russia, who killed countless Christians—more than in any holocaust. We are still reaping the consequences of their actions, not only in China and North Korea but also in Russia, Ukraine, and the rest of the world. This is not a joke or a matter of past history; the devil continues to block the mission, seeking to destroy and harm the church through wars, laws, restrictions, and various other means.

Even in the so-called free world, the devil works through feminism and hedonism. If you look around, wherever you live, you’ll notice that people are primarily concerned with material comforts—buying things, making life more comfortable, beautifying their homes, finding the best deals, and indulging in pleasures. This is all about serving the belly, as Satan is portrayed as a worm moving on its belly, consuming the ground. This imagery represents the most miserable state for people who become consumed by material concerns, leading them to hell. Yet, the invitation to enter the kingdom of heaven remains open. The Lord is calling everyone into His kingdom.

When we read the Apocalypse and carefully study the words of the Lord in the Gospels regarding the end times, we see that there are two distinct periods. I may dedicate a special video to this topic, but in summary, the first period is marked by wars, rumors of wars, and various disasters. This is not yet the end. The second period, which follows, is the actual end—a short but intense time referred to as the "great tribulation" or "great sorrow." In some translations, it is called the "great disaster" or "great persecution," but the original Greek word "thlipsis" means sorrow. During this time of great sorrow, not only will nations fight against each other, but even family members will turn against one another. Most importantly, the church will face persecution on an unprecedented scale, and humanity will be enslaved.

Let us remain vigilant and prepared, keeping our focus on the eternal invitation to the kingdom of heaven, even as we navigate the challenges of these times.

By the Antichrist, the work of the mission will be halted, and people will refuse to repent despite the natural disasters meant to lead them to repentance. Instead, they will grow angrier, utter blasphemies, and, in their determination to remain in evil, will receive the marks of the beast. At that point, they will be unable to repent. It is astonishing how the entire world can be rendered incapable of repentance. For the saints—the true Christians who remain faithful during those days—this will be the greatest sorrow. Even for the Lord Himself, it will be a time of profound grief, which is why it is called the "great sorrow." Although we have already experienced significant trials, we are not yet in that final period. We are still in the earlier phase, which is not yet the end. 

The reason I say this is that the mission is still ongoing. The end will come only when the Gospel has been preached to the entire world, ensuring that every person on earth has had the opportunity to receive the true Gospel and become Orthodox Christians. Those who make the right choice and respond to this invitation will do so, and there will be no further opportunities for the mission. Only then will the end come. Brothers and sisters, this means that our mission efforts and their fruits are directly tied to the coming of the Antichrist. He will not come as long as the mission continues to bear fruit. This gives us great encouragement to carry out this mission and reassures us that we are not passive observers watching the world descend into hell. 

As a missionary, I can share my experiences and feelings with you. While most people today are consumed by heresies, mammonism, hedonism, or other distractions like yoga, Kabbalah, Satanism, astrology, and other forms of occultism, we are still finding precious souls—like diamonds hidden beneath layers of dirt. Despite the challenges, we encounter people who repent and turn to Christ. For example, we have former Satanists who have become devout Orthodox Christians. There is an American professor who was a Protestant for 30 years, then a Catholic for another 30, before finally discovering Orthodoxy in his 60s. In China, despite the oppressive communist regime and widespread materialism, we still find individuals who, despite all prohibitions and the devil's attempts to hinder the mission, are drawn to the Church and become modern-day saints. I say this with confidence because I witness their eagerness, their closeness to the Lord, and their seriousness about spiritual life. These encounters inspire me to continue the mission.

Brothers and sisters, this mission is a gift and a responsibility the Lord has entrusted to us. He hopes we will be active in it. Consider this: the Lord created the world so that people could be united with Him, receiving Christ in their hearts, being invited into heaven, and partaking in His grace and wisdom. As long as new souls are coming to Him, this world has a purpose. It is also up to us to ensure that this purpose is fulfilled. Let us remain steadfast in our mission, knowing that our efforts are not in vain and that they play a crucial role in the unfolding of God's plan.

It is not enough for us to passively observe what is happening around us. We must be active participants in the mission entrusted to us. It is in our hands to push the coming of the Antichrist further into the future. We are not afraid of the digital control, currency manipulation, brainwashing, or any other schemes of this world. For us, these things are nothing as long as we remain faithful to the Lord. We do not worry if the world chooses to slip into slavery; that is the world's choice. But we will remain steadfast in our faith, bringing forth the spiritual fruits that the Lord is waiting for. 

First and foremost, our lives must be centered on prayer. Prayer should permeate every aspect of our lives, bringing us peace, strength, and courage. Through prayer, we find the power to testify, to live faithfully, and to face every challenge with the Lord by our side. May the Lord's joy be with you during these days. May you feel the invitation and the openness of the heavens. May we remain loyal and steadfast in the truth, not deceived by false teachings or false authorities. Let us be part of the living body of Christ—the Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, the only true Church. Let us not fall into the trap of fake ecumenism or spiritual adultery, which is so prevalent in many denominations today.

May the Lord be with us, and may His blessing, joy, and truth be with all of us. Merry Epiphany, brothers and sisters!
