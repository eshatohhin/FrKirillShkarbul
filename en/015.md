# Why Christians are real “Jews”

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are going to talk about what it means to be a Jew and what the term "Jewish" really means. We will arrive at a surprising conclusion that a real Christian is, in fact, a real Jew. Let's first talk about the roots, the origins of this word. It comes from the Hebrew word "Yehudi" or "Yehudim" in plural, which means "to glorify God" or someone who glorifies God. The Jewish people come from Judah. In Hebrew, Judah is "Yehuda," which also means "to glorify God" or someone who glorifies God. He is one of the Yehudim. Judah was one of the twelve patriarchs, sons of Jacob, and from them, the twelve tribes of Israel come. One of the largest tribes is the tribe of Judah, which settled in the southern part of Palestine, of the Holy Land, and this southern kingdom was called Judea, also after the name Judah. Meanwhile, the northern kingdom was called the kingdom of Israel, and it was later conquered by the Assyrian empire, mixed with pagans, and essentially lost. The southern kingdom was later conquered by Babylon, and it is mainly from the time of the Babylonian exile that the people who maintained the religion, the Old Testament faith, called themselves Jewish—those who are from Judea. Later, everyone, no matter which tribe they were from within this Old Testament faith, if they believed and belonged to this faith, would be considered Jewish. So, first and foremost, this is a religious concept, not an ethnic one, and it is related to this faith. We also read in the prophets and in Old Testament literature that to be Jewish means to be against all kinds of paganism, not to accept anything pagan, to believe only in one God, and to preserve His commandments and follow Him. This is the significance of the title "Jewish." In the epistle to the Romans, the Apostle Paul says in chapter 2, verse 28, that you are called to be real Jews, and a real Jew is not someone who is externally so on the outside. The real circumcision is not what is done externally, but rather what is inside that makes you a Jew and makes you circumcised in your heart. So, what does this mean? It means that in Old Testament times, someone who was circumcised was someone who was dedicated to God. They had this mark on their body, signifying that they had sacrificed and were obedient to God, cutting their own will to submit to God's will. This became very important, and the Apostle Paul and the early church fathers tell us that the external laws, all Old Testament commandments, and also the rituals that existed—these purification rituals and all kinds of other meal rituals, clothing rituals, and various other rituals—were all intended to facilitate what is inside someone's heart. Like a uniform: if you're a firefighter, you put on a uniform, and you feel that you have this responsibility. Or if you're a soldier, you wear a uniform, not just to enjoy the feel of it, but to be reminded of your responsibility, and it influences your internal will and the decisions you make. In the same way, all of the external laws, regulations, and traditions were for the purpose of bringing people to an internal understanding of their responsibility and their covenant with the God of Israel. When this was lost, the problem arose. This is why Christ often told them that on the outside, they were so nice and had all those clothes, but inside, they were like tombs, full of filthiness and bad smells. On the outside, they were very nice, like monuments, but inside, it was very different. He argued with them about this, and the Apostle Paul said that it is not worthy to boast about something external, to say, "Well, you see, I'm a descendant of Abraham or Moses, or I'm circumcised, or I'm this or that."

It is important to boast about Christ and about your faith. Your faith is what is inside you. It is not a certificate that you are baptized, that you wear a cross, or that you are a priest wearing priestly garments. For God, these external things mean nothing. God looks inside who you are and what you have in your heart. To be circumcised means to have all kinds of sin, dirt, and evil thoughts thrown away from your heart. You are keeping yourself clean for God to guide you and to live within you. This is the real circumcision. To have a heart like this means to be a real Jew. This is what the Apostle Paul is telling us. We must remember this. 

There is also a very interesting story that a priest once shared with me about why he considers himself a Jew. He said, "Every time I partake of the Holy Communion, I receive into myself the blood and body of a Jew—Jesus Christ, who was also ethnically Jewish. That is why His blood flows in my veins, and I am a Jew as well." This argument is interesting, but it is simply the perspective of one priest. For us, the most important thing is not any ethnic connection. For us, the most important thing is to have Christ living inside us. That is what makes us truly Jewish people. 

Today, we will not discuss modern Judaism or ethnic issues. We respect all ethnic matters, but we are focusing on the deeper meaning—the meaning given to us by the Gospel, the Bible, the Old Testament, and the Holy Fathers—of what it means to be Jewish, to truly be a Jew, and to be called someone who glorifies God. "Yehudi" is someone who gives glory to God. 

May Christ give us this heart, help us overcome all kinds of temptations and misunderstandings, and may the blessing of our Lord be with every one of you.
