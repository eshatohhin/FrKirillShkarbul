# Why Jesus is called “Christ” and “Messiah”

Dear friends, what does it mean to be a Christian?  
To be a Christian doesn't merely mean to believe in Christ.  
To be a Christian means to follow Christ, to have Christ live in our hearts.  

And who is Christ?  
Why is a man named Jesus called Christ?  
"Christ" comes from the Greek word *Christos*, which means "the anointed one."  
In Hebrew, it is *Mashiach*.  
*Mashiach* refers to the one who receives anointing, the anointed one.  
In English, this becomes *Messiah*.  
So, *Messiah* and *Christ* are the same; they are originally the same word.  

And who was anointed?  
Why is Jesus called the anointed one?  
In Old Testament times, three ministries required anointment.  
Anointment was performed with special oil, a special mixture called *mirror*.  
The three ministries were the prophetic ministry (the prophets), the kings (King Saul, King David, and later kings), and the priests (especially the high priest).  
To receive a ministry from God, one had to be anointed.  

Christ was the promised Messiah, the promised one who would come, having received the anointment and the special mission from God.  
He would become the Savior of the world.  
He is not just an anointed one; He is *the* Anointed One, the Christ, the Messiah.  
There can be no other Christs or Messiahs.  

The name *Jesus*, meaning "salvation," is the name of Christ, of Jesus Christ.  
But *Christ* is His title.  
We consider Him to be Christ, the Anointed One.  
This is one of the reasons why, in Hebrew, even until now, the word *Christ* is absent.  
The word for Christians is *Natsri* or *Natsrin*, which simply means "the Nazarenes."  
This is because the Jews at that time did not accept Jesus as Christ. In Hebrew, even today, the term *Christ* is absent and replaced by *Natsri*.  
There is nothing antisemitic about this; it is simply a matter of linguistics.  
We love the Jewish people, and our most beloved Jew is Christ Himself.  

We are followers of Christ, and we are Christians.  
How is this related to anointment?  
Christ Himself received all three ministries through His anointment by God.  
He received the ministry of the prophet, bringing God's message to the people—indeed, He *is* the message of God.  
He received the ministry of a king, for He is the King of the universe, the King of kings, and the King of Israel.  
The new Israel is the Church, and He is the King and Head of the Church.  
He also received the ministry of a priest, offering Himself as a sacrifice for the redemption and salvation of humanity, for those who follow Him—the Christians.  
He is both the priest and the sacrifice, the eternal priest who brings our prayers and souls to God the Father.  
We offer our lives to Him so that He may bring us to God, and He makes us partakers of His divine body and blessed blood.  
Thus, we become one with Him.  

What we also need to learn from this is that every Christian participates in these three ministries.  
Each of us, in a certain sense, must become a prophet, a king, and a priest.  
This is why we speak of the common priesthood, the idea that everyone is part of the priesthood.  
This is practically realized during the divine service, the divine liturgy.  
In the Orthodox, authentic apostolic faith, the sacrifice completed during the liturgy is offered by the Church as a whole, not by the priest alone.  
Unlike in Catholic theology, where the Mass is performed by the priest, in Orthodoxy, it is the entire community, the whole Church, that brings the sacrifice and makes it possible.  
A priest alone cannot serve the divine liturgy in the Orthodox Church.

There must be at least one faithful participant to represent the Church and to make this sacrament happen.  
Let us remember this.  

There are many things to discuss and reflect upon regarding how we can become prophets, kings, and priests.  
We can become prophets by bringing God's message to others and by being witnesses of Christ in this world.  
This is our prophetic mission.  

We can become kings as those who are called to create and establish the Church in this world.  
Whether it is in our family, our own heart, or the company or organization where we work, we are called to establish these as a kingdom of heaven.  
In this sense, we are, so to speak, "small kings" or local administrators.  
We participate in this kingship, in the mission of the Lord, to establish and nurture the body of Christ incarnate in this world, creating a small realization of the kingdom of heaven here on earth.  

If there are no people around us who can become part of this small church that we establish, we must first establish the kingdom of heaven in our own hearts.  
This is the foundation for any other ministry we undertake.  
We must work on our own hearts, purging them of all error, sin, and passion, mortifying our old selves, and becoming God-bearers and Christ-cross-bearers.  
We bear the cross of Christ.  

May the Lord help us in this mission, on this path.  
May the Lord assist us in our spiritual lives, granting us His blessing, His love, and the willingness to follow Him.
