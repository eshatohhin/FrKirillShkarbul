# Why Faith is weak or absent What to do

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about a very important topic – why is our faith getting weak, and why we have all kinds of troubles in our spiritual life, both on an individual level and on the level of the whole church.

We remember the words of Christ: when the Son of Man comes again, will He find faith on earth? This means that true faith will be so rare, it will be almost absent. It will be very difficult to find people who truly live by faith. Everyone will be immersed in daily activities – eating, drinking, working, getting married – and that will be all there is. There will be very few people who live by faith, not just by belief in God. Belief in God is like belief in aliens. So what? It doesn’t change your life. But to live by faith – this is what the Lord is seeking, this is what He is expecting, and this is what He is giving to us, but we are not taking it.

How do we know that this is really a problem? Well, if you already believe in Christ, I think you’ve experienced the initial drive and the initial joy of finding true faith. But later, it became cooler and cooler. And maybe by now, you don’t really have that much excitement about going to church, reading the Bible, or praying, especially daily prayers. It has become something extra, maybe not that important. We don’t have a real drive for it. Instead, many things are grasping our attention – social media, movies, shopping, hobbies. We have all kinds of different interests, and we are completely consumed by them.

Why has it become like this? Why are we not as spiritual as we should be? Even in the church, we see that priests leave the church, they leave their priesthood, and they experience crises. Even people who pray a lot, read many books, and say many prayers still face crises in their faith. Why is it that very often we go to confession and confess the same things over and over? We are still stuck in the same sins we were years ago. This is a real problem. Why is all this happening? Why is our faith so weak?

Christ said, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own." Who is living a life like that? Who is completely relying on God and not on their bank account, job, connections, or other things? I haven’t met many people who live like that, including myself. This is what Christ is telling us: those who live by faith, who walk on water, are almost nonexistent, even among priests and monks.

So why is this happening? The reason for this spiritual problem lies in the Divine Liturgy. The Divine Liturgy is at the center of the life of the church. It is the source of sanctification. We wonder why, in the early church, there were so many martyrs, so many people who had a real drive for faith. Even catechumens, who were not yet baptized, were willing to sacrifice their lives. But now, we have people who have been going to church for 50 years and are still stingy, selfish, and hold grudges. They suffer from depression, and after 50 years, there is not much change. Why is this happening?

This is the question that priests and pastors are always asking themselves and asking God: why is this happening? The answer lies in the Divine Liturgy. It all has to do with how we understand it, how we participate in it, and how it sanctifies and gives us rebirth – or fails to do so. The big issue is that we consider ourselves as just "me and God." We come to the Liturgy, listen to some prayers, pray ourselves, and hope to receive some kind of sanctification or peace, and then we leave. This is the core misunderstanding of the Divine Liturgy.

Because the Divine Liturgy is the *unio ecclesiae* (from the Greek words meaning "the unity of the church"), it is those who are called by God and come together who realize this nature of the church. However, we often fail to feel the responsibility and role we are meant to play in this. This is why we do not receive the benefits we are supposed to. We are not truly connected to that portal, as we might call it, which is opened to the kingdom of heaven during the Divine Liturgy. In the church, when the church on earth is united with the church in heaven, we receive all the grace, blessings, and life that Christ gives – this new reality. This is what we are able to receive when we are connected to that portal.

There are some basic things we need to understand about this portal, this key to accessing it. Just as you need a key to enter any portal, we need certain keys to receive all that is offered. One of these keys is to treat the Divine Liturgy as a union, as a gathering of people called by God. Without this understanding, we will not truly be part of it.

I have summarized five basic principles that each of us must follow if we want to be real Christians and members of the body of Christ, the Orthodox Holy Church. Let us strive to make these principles a reality in our lives, starting today. Today is Saturday, and tomorrow is Sunday. If you are watching this video today, you can begin implementing these principles today. If not, start on the closest Saturday or Sunday.

**The first rule** is to come on time, or even before the service begins. If you come late, it means you are treating the gathering as though it does not matter. It becomes just an external event, something happening out there that you passively observe. But this is not the case. Your presence is essential for this miracle to happen. If you do not come, you are disconnected. If you do not come on time, you miss the moment when we gather, and the miracle occurs when we gather. This is why it is so fundamental and important for us to come on time.

**The second rule** is not to miss the evening service. If we miss the evening service, we are not participating in the full cycle of worship. What is the full cycle? It includes Vespers, Matins, and the Liturgy. This is the complete divine service. The evening service, Vespers and Matins, is like the Old Testament, guiding us and bringing us into the mystery of Christ. Vespers is dedicated to the Old Testament, while Matins focuses on the coming of Christ – the miracle of His arrival in the world to save it. The Liturgy itself is the climax, the apex of the divine service, where we celebrate Christ’s life, preaching, ministry, resurrection, victory over death, and His second glorious coming. We cannot simply jump into the New Testament without preparation. The full cycle of divine service includes both the evening and morning services. If you cannot attend the evening service in church, you can still participate at home. This is better than not doing it at all. This is what is important in lay ministry, or lay service.

**The third rule** is to set the goal of participating in the Holy Eucharist, receiving Holy Communion every Sunday. This must become a norm for us. It is not just an external rule to follow. We must prepare spiritually, recognizing that each time we receive Holy Communion, it is a great event in our lives. We must live spiritually, eagerly expecting and craving Holy Communion. We must make it a priority, read the necessary prayers, prepare ourselves, and receive Holy Communion every Sunday.

It’s not that you have to start doing all of this perfectly right now. However, this must become our goal. We cannot give up. You might say, "Well, for me, receiving Holy Communion once a month is fine." But we cannot settle for that. We cannot relax. If we have not yet reached the goal of receiving Holy Communion every Sunday, we must set it as a target. We must say, "I am working toward this. I will not give up until I reach that goal in my life – to receive Holy Communion on every Lord’s Day, every Sunday." This is the healthy liturgical and sacramental life we are called to live.

**The fourth rule** is for us to study and understand every word of the divine service. We must set this as a goal. It’s not enough to simply attend and enjoy the chanting or the atmosphere. We must understand what is happening, and our hearts must follow every part of the service. For example, we need to understand the meaning of the small entrance and the great entrance. We must grasp the structure and the literal meaning of every word, at least initially. Over time, we can deepen our understanding by reading books, asking questions, listening to lectures, and growing in knowledge. But the first step is to fully understand the literal meaning of what is happening during the Divine Liturgy. This is an essential condition for true participation.

**The fifth and final rule** is that we must participate in the life of the parish. We cannot simply come to church, pray, and leave without engaging with others. We must recognize that the parish is our spiritual family, the people of God. We need to participate in their lives and in the life of the parish. Perhaps you can help the priest in some way – by serving as an altar boy, a chanter, preparing food, cleaning the church, or assisting in other ways. You can also support others in the parish who may be facing challenges in their families or personal lives. Even a few words of encouragement can make a difference. This must become a norm, a goal for us. If this is not yet practiced in your parish, start with yourself. Do not be afraid of potential difficulties or misunderstandings. As Christians, we are called to be ready to suffer, as it will make us stronger. We must walk on the waters of faith, unafraid of dangers or challenges. Remember the words: "Whoever sows generously will also reap generously." We must be generous in our lives and in our faith – open, forgiving, and giving.

Let us remember these five simple rules. If we begin to practice them and place the Divine Liturgy at the center of our lives, we will see Christ growing within us. We will become new creations, bearing the fruits of faith in our daily lives. It will become much more difficult for depression, loneliness, stress, or any other challenge to harm us or lead us astray. Let us put more effort into this and ask the Lord to bless us with His wisdom and grace, so that we may dare to approach Him and seek greater spiritual gifts. As the Apostle Paul said, "Eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way." Let us strive for this excellence in our spiritual lives.

We must always ask for more talents and greater gifts of faith from God. He will show us an even better way and grant us greater joy in living for Him and following Him, despite the chaos and challenges around us, and despite any temptations or weakening of faith we may face. May the Lord help us and bless us. Amen.
