# 4 weaknesses we need to overcome

Dear brothers and sisters, we are facing dark times.  
We see that humanity as a whole is departing from the Christian faith.  
In the 19th century, people began to lose their faith.  
In the 20th century, governments declared that they had no relationship with faith,  
with Christianity, in many countries.  
Some countries became atheistic and materialistic, opposing the Church and God.  
Now, in this postmodern age, Islam is rising, and Christianity is becoming weaker on a societal level.  
Both governments and societies are becoming increasingly pagan, post-Christian, and embracing  
all kinds of Asian practices and other ideologies that are far removed from Christ.  

In this situation, it is likely that things will get worse. From what we observe, we may face more  
totalitarian and pagan regimes in the future.  
We need to be prepared to carry out our Christian ministry and testimony in these dark times that we are entering.  
And, to be honest, we are not in good shape.  
We can compare ourselves to the early Church, from which we need to learn, because they were able to overcome  
all the challenges they faced. Their faith was much stronger, and their understanding of what it meant to be a Christian  
was quite different from ours today.  

Today, I want to discuss four problems that we face. These issues relate both to non-Orthodox Christians—heterodox groups,  
Protestants, Catholics, and others—as well as to similar problems within the Orthodox Church, which are also deeply troubling.  

The first problem is the fragmentation of Christians. We see that everyone who calls themselves a Christian today belongs to  
a different group or denomination, each with its own conscience and self-awareness. I am speaking here primarily about Protestant groups.  
In the Catholic Church, there are also many factions, and in the Orthodox Church, we face the issue of division into local churches.  
Historically, local churches existed, but this was purely a matter of geography—it had no political implications.  
Now, however, we face the problem of people associating certain nations with specific churches. For example, there is the Bulgarian Orthodox Church,  
which is tied to the Bulgarian nation, as if all Bulgarians are supposed to be Orthodox Christians. The same applies to the Russian Church,  
the Georgian Church, the Greek Church, and so on. This connection between churches and nations is contrary to the spirit of the Church.  
This is a remnant of a time when governments cooperated closely with the Church. The government itself was Christian,  
its members were devout Christians, and they supported the Church. The Church, in turn, cooperated with the government,  
and nearly the entire society was part of the Church, living as Christians—at least in appearance, if not always in truth.  
Even then, this was questionable, but it is far from the reality we face today.  

Now, in every nation, only a tiny minority are truly Christians—those for whom following Christ is not just empty words.  
Governments are secular, and at any moment, they could declare opposition to the Church or take other hostile actions.  
While most are currently tolerant, this could change at any time.

So we can see that all of this is vanishing now, and we need to return to what?  
We must not cling to the current model, where in some Orthodox countries, for example,  
the Church is tied to national identity. Instead, we need to return to the model of the early Church.  
The key principle of the early Church is that we, as Christians, are a new nation—one nation.  
This nation is the successor of ancient Israel, the people chosen by God in the Old Testament,  
who received His promises and blessings. Now, all of this has been taken from the Jewish nation  
and given to this new nation, the new Israel. We, as Christians, have the great mission and blessing  
of being this new nation. Everything else fades away: our distinctions, our nationalities,  
our ethnicities—none of it matters in Christ. In Christ, there is no Jew or Gentile, no Greek or barbarian.  
The Greek here represents another nation, not a Jew. But in Christ, the main point is that all distinctions vanish.  
This does not mean that all people in the world are the same—Christians and non-Christians alike.  
No, the distinction is in Christ. When we become part of the body of Christ, all these worldly distinctions  
become irrelevant and meaningless. We must become part of this new nation.  

When the early Christian martyrs were asked, "What nation are you from? To whom do you belong?"  
they answered, "We are Christians." When asked, "What country are you from?" they replied,  
"We are Christians." That was their only answer. This is what we lack today. As long as we are part of the Church,  
united with Christ, we are one—one nation chosen by God with a special mission. This is what we are missing.  
This is the first thing we need to be aware of and stand firm on.  

The second problem is that the boundaries of the Church have become very blurred in our time.  
This is due to an anthropocentric worldview that emerged during the Renaissance, placing humanity  
at the center of everything. Now, the individual—your identity as a citizen, as a human being—  
has become more important in our minds than faith. Faith has been reduced to a mere attribute,  
a property that people possess. Everyone is seen as having the same rights, the same importance,  
the same value, but with different ideas. These ideas are seen as secondary and changeable.  
This is the problem. As a result, we no longer clearly see the boundaries of the Church.  
We struggle to discern who is part of the Church and who is not. For us, it has become relative.  

This is another significant issue we face. We need to understand that we are chosen by God,  
and this is profoundly important and special. However, another reason for this lack of self-awareness  
is that Christians have become proud and filled with vainglory. If we are told that we are special  
and chosen, we often interpret this to mean that we are better than others. We become arrogant and prideful,  
falling into a narrow-minded mindset. Because of this pride and arrogance, the Lord withholds  
this understanding from us. The Church grows weaker, and we lose our saltiness—we become ineffective.  
This is another problem we must address.

First of all, of course, we need to be humble, repent of our sins, and love others  
from the depths of our hearts more than ourselves. We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves,  
and only then will we begin to see the mission we have been given and understand that we are  
chosen by God for a special purpose. This is the second problem we must face and overcome.  

The third problem is our static understanding of the Church. Here, I am speaking specifically  
about the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church rightly remembers that the Church is the body  
of Christ—a mystical body to which we are all connected. This understanding of the Church's  
boundaries is crucial, even if we cannot see them clearly. This ecclesiological understanding  
is very clear and important. However, too often, this understanding becomes static and limited.  
We begin to think of the Church as a physical body, where we are either connected and receiving  
its life-giving "juices" or separated from it. If we are connected, we think, "Now we can relax;  
we are fine. We are part of this tree." But we must remember that all these parables about the Church  
are attempts to describe a mystery. None of them can fully explain what the Church truly is.  

We also see the Church described in other ways: as a building being constructed—a great castle or fortress—  
with Christians as the stones, each of different types. We see the Church as a young virgin,  
as a woman clothed with the sun in the Book of Revelation, and as an elderly woman, full of wisdom and experience.  
The Church is portrayed as a ship navigating through storms and turbulent waters. There are many visions of the Church,  
and all of them point to the fact that the Church is a mystery. We cannot reduce it to a single image or idea.  

Therefore, we must understand our belonging to the Church dynamically. The more we humble ourselves,  
the more we sacrifice, the more we strive to follow Christ and keep His commandments, the more we love Him,  
the more we receive His grace and help. It is not a simple "yes" or "no" matter. We must continually exert effort  
to remain with Christ, to follow Him, and only then can we remain in His grace and grow strong in Him.  
This is another crucial point we must remember.  

Finally, the last issue I want to address today is individualism. We live in an age of extreme individualism.

We have become focused solely on "me and God," and nothing else. As long as I feel fine with God,  
it doesn’t matter what happens to the rest of the world. If the world ends and everyone perishes,  
I don’t care. It’s just me and Him. This mindset is completely wrong. We can only be saved as part of the Church.  
The Church is a community where everyone has responsibility for one another. We carry each other’s burdens,  
help one another, and pray for one another. Our prayers are only truly effective when they are part of the common prayer of the Church.  
Together, we constitute the body of Christ. This is extremely important. Even when I pray alone,  
it is not just me praying—I am praying together with the whole Church. I must have this understanding.  
That is why we pray, "Our Father who art in heaven," and not "My Father who art in heaven."  
This is another thing we must overcome.  

So, please, be prepared to enter into these dark times. We are heading into these dark ages  
partly because of the weaknesses I have listed. We must do everything we can to prevent these dark times from coming,  
but the best thing we can do is to prepare ourselves well for their arrival.  

We must also remember that the word "holy" or "saint" in Hebrew is *kadosh*, which means "separated."  
We, as the Church, are set apart, taken into the bosom of the Lord. As those who are chosen and set apart,  
we carry out a special mission and function. Let us always remember this. Let us feel this as a reality,  
not just as an abstract idea. If we do, we will receive blessings and help from our Lord Jesus Christ  
every day of our lives. This will enable us to carry out our testimony, to remain strong and united,  
and to be victorious in this war against evil and the devil.  

May the Lord help each one of you. Amen.
