# Coronavirus lesson pandemics of sin

Dear friends, we can learn many spiritual lessons from the coronavirus pandemic that is currently taking place and has claimed millions of lives. The reason is that we cannot see sin. Even when we know what sin is, we often fail to truly grasp its impact. We might think of sin as someone doing something wrong, but we dismiss it with a "so what?" attitude. Similarly, we cannot see the coronavirus itself, yet we see its effects every day through statistics—how many people have died, how many are suffering, and how our loved ones are affected. This is the reality. 

Although we cannot see the virus, its impact is undeniable. Flights are grounded, masks are worn, economies are struggling, and significant global changes are occurring because of this invisible threat. In the same way, sin is also like a virus. There are different types of sin, just as there are different types of viruses, and they are spreading rapidly—even faster than the coronavirus. Sin does not require physical proximity to spread; it can infect us through movies, the internet, and other media. 

Today’s society has become tolerant of all kinds of sin, but this tolerance is not a sign of democracy or something positive. Instead, it reflects a lack of immunity and protection. Society has become so corrupted and polluted that it is unable to resist spiritual sicknesses and viruses. Just as we often overlook the flu or other illnesses, we fail to notice the devastating effects of sin. For example, millions die from the flu or AIDS each year, but these deaths often go unnoticed. Now, with the coronavirus, we are confronted daily with statistics about deaths in various countries, making the reality of the situation painfully clear.

We must understand that sin, in its various forms, leads to the spiritual and physical death of millions every day. To protect ourselves and our loved ones, we need to take preventive measures and seek "vaccination" against sin. 

Let me provide a few examples of sins that are spreading rapidly. Some of these sins did not exist a few decades ago, while others have been around for much longer. Gambling, especially online gambling, is spreading uncontrollably, infecting people and leading to ruin. Filthy humor, explicit shows, astrology, occultism, and superstitions are also spreading quickly. More traditional sins, such as smoking, excessive drinking, and drug use, continue to take their toll. Obscene language and destructive music are infecting people worldwide, harming their minds and souls. 

Tattoos, piercings, and immodest fashion trends are spreading rapidly, promoting a lack of chastity and morality. Pornography, like a virus, is addicting people and destroying lives. Social media platforms like Facebook encourage self-obsession, with people constantly posting photos of themselves, seeking validation, and believing their lives are extraordinary when, in reality, they are no different from anyone else. 

These are just a few examples of how sin spreads and infects our world. We must recognize the danger and take action to protect ourselves spiritually.
