# What timepersonbusiness is the most important in life

Dear brothers and sisters, one of the purposes of our videos is to teach us Christian wisdom that can be applied in daily life. What does it mean to live a Christian life and to follow Christ? The Holy Fathers provide us with many important clues and practical advice on how to follow Christ and live a Christian life.  

Today, we are going to discuss what time is the most important in our lives, who is the most important person, and what matter or business is the most significant in our lives. The Holy Fathers tell us that the most important time is now—this present moment. We recall Christ's words in Matthew 6:34, where He tells us not to worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Instead, we should focus on today, as each day has enough trouble of its own.  

Today is far more important than yesterday or tomorrow. The most critical time is now. A common problem people face is living in the past. We reminisce about vacations or memories, and in doing so, we dwell in that past time. This is a mistake, and as people grow older, they tend to live more in the past.  

Another common mistake, especially among young people, is living in the future. We imagine that in the future, we will achieve certain goals, have more money, opportunities, a house, a family, and so on. We become preoccupied with what will happen later, while neglecting the present. We see the present as a tough time to endure—paying mortgages, dealing with daily chores—and we dismiss it as unimportant, focusing instead on the goals we hope to achieve.  

This is a mistake because the present moment is far more significant. It is now that shapes your entire life. What you think, the direction you take, your attitude toward God and life—all of this is determined in the present. The choices you make right now can influence your entire life. This is why the present is so important. We remember the Lord's words: "Be vigilant, do not sleep." Being vigilant means being ready at every moment—ready to make decisions, to choose, to act. You must be spiritually awake, not asleep.  

Another major issue today is living in a virtual world, where we are disconnected from time. We immerse ourselves in games, social media, movies, or other virtual spaces. If you observe people on the street or in subways, you'll notice that most are engrossed in their devices, living in a virtual reality. They are disconnected from the present, the future, and the past. This is dangerous because it separates us from the real world, real responsibilities, and the real decisions God calls us to make.  

When we are separated from real life, we are also separated from God. As the Lord says, "Let the dead bury their own dead." If a person is disconnected from real life, they cannot be spiritually alive. This has been a problem even before the rise of virtual reality, but it has grown worse.  

So, who is the most important person in our lives? The Holy Fathers tell us that it is the person who is in front of you or by your side at this very moment. This is the person you are interacting with or speaking to now. They are the most important person in your life at that moment. This is something you must always remember—it is not just anyone.

And especially if this person cannot repay you or do anything in return—if you are helping them simply because you are a Christian—that is even more significant than anything or anyone else. Why? Because Christ said, "Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." Remember, this will be the decisive factor on the Last Judgment. Through serving others, especially those who cannot repay us, we serve Christ Himself. In those moments, they become the recipients of our ministry to Christ, and this act goes directly into our heavenly deposit.  

The goal of our life is to accumulate treasures in heaven. Right now, we are making deposits—doing something for someone without expecting anything in return, without conditions or benefits. We are, in essence, depositing spiritual currency into the kingdom of heaven. This is the most meaningful time and the most important person in our life.  

If no one is in front of us and we are alone, the most important thing is to be with Christ. Whether we are working or resting, what matters is that we are in dialogue with Him. If we are working, we must remember that Christ is near us, helping and supporting us, watching over us. What we do is our ministry to Him, not just a task to complete. We do it as well as we can, for God. If we are resting, we should use it as an opportunity for spiritual growth, remembering that God is with us, watching and listening, waiting for us to speak to Him. Whatever we do, we must maintain this dialogue with Christ.  

This is incredibly important. Many people live in depression, feeling alone because they lack friends or have been abandoned by loved ones. If we experience such loneliness, the only way out is to seek Christ. If we feel alone, it means we have not yet truly found Him. This is the time to say, "I need God. I need to find Him." We must knock on every door, seek Him relentlessly until we find the relief of His presence.  

We also see the dangers of living in a virtual world, which is so common today. People return from gaming or other virtual activities feeling empty, unhappy, and in a bad mood. Why? Because they were without God during that time. They sought a surrogate for happiness—escaping into games or other distractions—but now, back in real life, they feel the absence of God because they have not sought Him. This shows how spiritually harmful it is to live in virtual reality.  

Finally, what is the most important matter or business in our lives? It is the one we are dealing with at this moment, with the person in front of us. The matter we are discussing or working on together is the most important in our life. We must approach it with all our effort, as it will have spiritual significance and provide opportunities to gain something for eternal life. This is crucial.

Even if the task at hand seems insignificant—perhaps we are not creating something grand or monumental—we must treat it as the most important thing in our life because it is our ministry to Christ. Maybe we are simply sweeping the floor or doing something equally trivial, but for us, at this moment, it is the most important task. We must not rush through it, thinking, "I have something else to do." Instead, we must do it as well as we can, because it matters now.  

Often, we avoid dealing with certain things, saying, "I have no time," or "Let’s leave it for later, for tomorrow." This reveals that we do not truly value or want that task in our lives. It is not important to us because, deep down, our conscience—our human nature—tells us that the present moment is what matters most. We are created to prioritize the "now," even if we are often confused or misaligned with this truth. When we say, "Later, later," it is a sign that we do not truly want to engage with that task, because what is happening now is what should hold our attention, even if we do not fully understand its significance.  

Let us keep this in mind and strive to grow in Christ. He desires for us to be with Him, to grow in wisdom, and to live every moment of our lives to the fullest. Our goal is to gain as much as we can for Christ, to grow stronger spiritually, and to walk this path faithfully, following Him. May His blessing be with us every day, and may the wisdom and Spirit of God always guide us. Amen.
