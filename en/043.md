# Christmas and the Second Coming

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas!  
We enter into this great feast of the Church, and we will celebrate it for 10 days.  
This is the second-largest feast in the Church, after Pascha, after Easter.  
It is also called Winter Pascha.  
This feast brings us the joy of greeting the Lord, who has come into this world.  
We wear white, and the entire Church uses the color white to represent the light brought by the Savior, the purity, and the renewal that comes to the earth.  

During this time, we reflect deeply on the spiritual meaning of the Lord's coming and prepare ourselves to welcome Him into our souls.  
This is the main purpose of the Advent period, the 40-day preparation, also known as the Nativity Fast, as we ready ourselves for the Lord's coming.  
We remember that when He came into this world, the world did not receive Him.  
The world did not want Him to fulfill His mission because it was immersed in earthly matters—both the pagans and the Jews.  
The Jews appeared faithful, observing many rituals and traditions, but their attitude was nominal.  
They lacked love for God and the willingness to follow Him no matter what.  
They had their own agenda, an earthly agenda, which clashed with the Lord's purpose.  
The same was true of the pagans.  
They, too, rejected the Lord's coming.  
This is why there were persecutions for 300 years.  
The pagans were proud of their culture, their philosophy, and lived in worship of idols and the flesh.  

This brings us to reflect on the meaning of Christmas today, in our time.  
We face two significant issues.  
First, we recall that the Lord brings peace.  
This is why we chant at Christmas, "Peace on earth and goodwill among men.  
The Lord has brought peace, divine peace from above."  
The goodwill is directed toward God, as people are willing to serve Him.  
However, not everyone is willing to serve God.  
This is why the Lord also said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace, but a sword."  
At times, this can be confusing.  
Is it peace or a sword?  
The Apostle Paul explains that the sword brought by God is the Word of God, which divides good from evil, truth from falsehood, and purity from corruption.  
This is what Christ brings.  
People must choose whether to follow Christ and His mission or to oppose Him and wage war against God.  

Today, we are in a spiritual war, a religious war.  
We must ask ourselves: Where do we stand, and whom are we fighting?  
It is crucial to understand that if we lack patience, repentance, piety, humility, and love for others, it is dangerous to speak of war.  
Without these virtues, we may become consumed by hatred—perhaps toward the government, or by obsessing over ideas of an Antichrist or evil forces at work.  
But a Christian carries peace in their soul, even while recognizing that a war is being waged.  
This war is against the spirit that seeks to deceive people and draw them away from God.  

There are two ways this deception manifests, which we can observe.  
One resembles the Jewish type, and the other the pagan type.  
The Jewish type represents fake Christianity, nominal Christianity.  
We celebrate Christmas, decorate our homes, exchange gifts, and enjoy the holidays.  
Yet, we live lives devoid of God, immersed in sin, serving mammon, and pursuing profit.  
Our hearts remain attached to worldly things.  
The external celebrations are merely decorations.  
This mirrors the attitude of the Jews who rejected Christ—they had the rituals but lacked true faith.

Because they were more pious than nominal Christians today.  
Yet, they were deeply immersed in their situation, maintaining worship and external rituals, but their hearts were unwilling to follow Christ.  

Another risk we face is that of modern paganism, which is openly anti-Christian.  
It rejects anything that reminds us of Christ.  
This is why even Christmas cards now say "Season's Greetings" instead of "Merry Christmas."  
People avoid mentioning Christ, and some even dream of canceling Christmas altogether.  
They want to celebrate something else, something devoid of Christ.  
This reflects the rise of modern age religions, neo-paganism, and movements like yoga and other oriental practices, which aim to erase even the slightest trace of Christianity.  
They seek to create a completely secular, anti-Christian world.  
We saw this in the Soviet Union, where anything related to the Church was abolished, replaced by a new ideology and doctrine.  
This is an openly anti-Christian approach, and we know it is happening again.  

We can also reflect on the historical context of Christmas.  
This feast was first celebrated in the Western Roman Empire, with the first recorded celebration under Constantine the Great in 336 AD—300 years after Christ's resurrection.  
Some argue that Christmas was introduced later in the Church's history, during a time when Christianity had conquered the world.  
That small group of faithful believers spread their testimony and brought the entire world under the influence of Christ.  
This is what Christmas represents: the Lord's coming into the world and the world's submission to His message of salvation, piety, and devotion to Christ.  

However, today we stand on the verge of slipping away completely—either through nominal Christianity or through openly anti-Christian, pagan ideologies.  
As Christians, we must become spiritually strong, as strong as the first Christians.  
If we are spiritually resilient, we can inspire the world to turn back to Christ and abandon the evil it embraces.  
This is our mission: to bring the world back to Christ.  
We have everything we need for this task, and the Lord is with us, helping us in this endeavor.  
We must not give up, for He is far stronger and mightier than any force in this world or any other.  

May the Lord help us, strengthen us on this path, and grant us the true joy of Christmas—the joy of the Lord's coming into this world to be with us, to help us, and to bring salvation to all. Amen.
