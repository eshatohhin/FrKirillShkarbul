# The Lent and the Babylon “If your right eye makes you stumble..”

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church is now concluding the fourth week of Lent, known as the week of veneration of the Holy Cross. This is one of the three strict weeks of Lent, which include the first week, the fourth week, and the upcoming Passion Week, the final week of Lent. These weeks are strict because they prepare us for the culmination of Lent. This period will lead us to Golgotha, and the purpose of Lent is to enable us to see with our spiritual eyes—to understand the meaning of Golgotha and the crucifixion, to delve into this mystery, and to be renewed with Christ through His Resurrection. We are called to live a new life in Christ, with the Kingdom of Heaven within us, and to mortify the old, sinful nature within us—that "Pharaoh," "Babylon," or even "Leviathan," as you might call it, which resides in each of us.

Today, I wish to discuss the practical distinction of the spirit of Babylon, which surrounds us. We live in Babylon. If you carry this thought with you, you will see that it is omnipresent. Whether you visit a department store, a movie theater, or simply walk down the street, you encounter advertisements, modern buildings, and elegant cars passing by. Visually, you can perceive Babylon—this pervasive consumerism. Let me take you step by step in identifying what I mean, for it is not merely about the material things that captivate our eyes. It is about how these things seek to draw our attention, to attract not just our eyes but our hearts and minds toward the things being advertised or presented. And it is not only the material things we see; it encompasses much more.

First, let us recall the prayer of Saint Ephraim the Syrian. In this prayer, we ask the Lord to remove from us the spirits of idleness, slothfulness, idle talk, ambition, the desire for power, and many other vices. We ask God to replace these with the spirits of meekness, humility, and love—the good spirits. What truly matters, unlike in some other denominations—perhaps in Catholicism or elsewhere—where the focus is on rules about what you can or cannot do, or the distinction between big and small sins, is the spirit within you. Are you in the spirit of God, or are you driven by a false spirit—the spirit of Babylon?

Now, during this most holy time in the middle of Lent, this distinction should become much more evident to us. Even though we live in this world and see it every day, it must become clearer during this season. I hope you can feel it and remember it even after Lent—that this spirit of Babylon is everywhere. It is not only in the material things I have described; it is also present on platforms like YouTube, Telegram, and Facebook, not to mention television or the virtual realities of video games where people waste their lives. This spirit is also within our families, among the people we interact with, and ultimately within ourselves—in our values, in the way we live, think, and speak.

Let us reflect deeply on this. Let us recall Matthew 5:29, where it is said, "If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." The same applies to your right hand or your foot. What does this mean? It is not merely about temptation through sight. The Holy Fathers, first and foremost, interpret this in terms of our relationships with others. It is a call to radical detachment from anything that leads us away from God, even if it is as dear to us as an eye or a hand. Let us take this to heart and seek God's help in overcoming the spirit of Babylon within and around us.

Indeed, you can imagine that in those days, the distractions were not as pervasive as they are today. We are now surrounded by a constant barrage of visual stimuli—everything is designed to capture our attention, our hearts, and our minds. In earlier times, people were not bombarded with images of beautiful cars, appliances, and other enticing products that tempt us to desire and acquire. However, the greater danger in those days lay in the people with whom they interacted. 

The Holy Fathers explain that, for example, the "eye" in Matthew 5:29 refers to the friends or acquaintances with whom we consult when making decisions—perhaps even our relatives. The "hand" symbolizes those closest to us, such as family members, who are like our hands—we rely on them, they help us, cook for us, and assist us in our daily lives. The "leg" represents coworkers or friends who support us in practical ways, perhaps by helping us fix things or complete tasks. 

In today’s world, much of this interaction has shifted to digital platforms, which is why we must also be cautious about the influence of technology, including artificial intelligence, on our lives. However, let us proceed step by step. 

We can see that anything that pulls us away from Christ, that distracts us from focusing entirely on Him and our spiritual life, is harmful. Such distractions can divert us from prayer, from attending church, from reflecting on the Gospel, and from living according to its values. These distractions can come from relationships that we must, at times, distance ourselves from or even sever. 

Of course, we still have obligations to our relatives—we love them and must care for them. However, when these relationships begin to harm our faith or hinder our walk with Christ, we must create boundaries. We may need to avoid consulting them on matters of faith or limit our trust in them when it comes to spiritual decisions. This does not mean abandoning them entirely, especially if they are elderly or young children who depend on us. In such cases, our responsibility to care for them remains, but their influence on our spiritual values may be less significant. 

Nevertheless, we must always be aware of these dangers. As Christ said, "Your greatest enemies are the people you live with." These are painful words, but they remind us that those closest to us—who know our weaknesses best—can sometimes cause us the most harm, even unintentionally. 

The Holy Fathers also provide a deeper level of understanding, focusing on our internal selves. The "I" represents our thoughts, feelings, and desires—those things within our hearts and minds that can lead us toward sin or away from Christ. The "hand" symbolizes our will and desires, which translate into actions. First, a thought or desire arises in our hearts or minds, and then it manifests in our actions. We must cut off anything within us that threatens our spiritual life and salvation. 

The reference to the "right eye" and "right hand" is significant. The "right" side represents our conscious self—the stronger, more dominant part of our being. The "left" side symbolizes our unconscious or weaker self. When our conscious self is drawn toward sin or distraction, our weaker self will inevitably follow. For example, when we lose control—such as when we are intoxicated—we may commit worse sins because our unconscious desires and instincts take over. 

Therefore, we must focus on strengthening and guarding our conscious self—the "right" side. If we can discipline and purify our conscious thoughts and actions, our weaker self will naturally align with it. The greatest danger lies in allowing our conscious self to be led astray, for the rest will follow. Let us remain vigilant and seek God’s grace to overcome these challenges, both within ourselves and in our relationships with others.

Indeed, there is a significant difference between sinning during the day and experiencing similar sins in our dreams. While both are concerning, the sins we commit while awake carry greater weight because they involve our conscious will and actions. Sins in dreams, though they may reflect the state of our subconscious, are not as grave because we have limited control over them. However, our prayers before sleep, our fasting, and our ongoing struggle against passions can influence what arises in our subconscious. By nurturing a life of prayer and spiritual discipline, we can gradually purify our hearts and minds, even in our dreams.

Now, let us return to the problem of Babylon. As I mentioned in a previous video, Babylon is a vast and pervasive topic, and we will continue to explore it in the future. It is essential to recognize that Babylon surrounds us, and we must learn how to maintain a spiritual distance from its influence. Even though we live in the midst of it, we must not allow its spirit to harm us. This is why figures like Marx and other secular thinkers claimed that "your being produces your conscience." When we lose our union with God and Christ, our material reality—what we see, do, and experience—begins to shape our minds, hearts, and values. This is a dangerous shift, as it leads us away from spiritual priorities and toward worldly concerns.

Because we are physical beings, it is challenging to completely abstain from the influences of the world. This is why some saints retreated to the desert, cutting themselves off from all external distractions to focus entirely on God. Babylon, however, seeks to bring "heaven" to earth. Its goal is not to unite humanity with God but to replace God with material prosperity, comfort, and worldly success. This is evident in both capitalist and socialist societies, where the focus is on economic growth, well-being, and earthly comforts. People turn away from the Church because they believe they can find their paradise here on earth, even though such a paradise is ultimately illusory.

Babylon manifests on multiple levels—in our hearts, minds, and the world around us. It thrives in shopping malls, trade centers, and the endless creation of new products designed to make life more convenient and appealing. We are drawn to these things, believing that health, appearance, and material possessions are of utmost importance. Over time, we become enslaved by the spirit of Babylon, adopting its lifestyle and values, and losing sight of our spiritual calling.

To conclude, I want to emphasize that the final incarnation of the Antichrist will not require the mass killing of Christians, as was seen in regimes like the Soviet Union, where millions of believers were persecuted to erase Christian influence. In the future, the Antichrist's agenda will not need to eliminate Christians in such numbers because many will already be living according to the spirit of Babylon. They will be consumed by comfort, convenience, prosperity, and entertainment, having abandoned their spiritual priorities. This is the subtle yet profound danger of Babylon—it enslaves not through force but through seduction, drawing us away from Christ and into a life centered on worldly desires. Let us remain vigilant and strive to live in the spirit of Christ, resisting the allure of Babylon at every turn.

We walk out of the church and, all too often, we become part of Babylon. This is the reality for many. The Antichrist will not need to kill us because, by then, many Christians will already be so deeply immersed in the spirit of Babylon that they will not recognize the Antichrist for who he truly is. Instead, they may welcome him as a great prophet, a king, or even as Christ himself. Their hearts and minds will have been so thoroughly reprogrammed and corrupted by worldly values that they will no longer be able to conceive of a life outside this materialistic paradigm. This is a grave danger, and we must be vigilant.

During Lent, we are called to sever our attachment to Babylon. We must confront the "snake" within our hearts—the desires and passions that awaken when we deny them. When we fast and pray, when we resist the temptations of pleasure and comfort, this inner "Pharaoh" becomes restless. It demands satisfaction, and we feel the pressure of its anger and frustration. This is why strict fasting and a disciplined spiritual life during Lent are so challenging. Yet, this struggle is necessary. We must ask the Lord to help us kill this "Pharaoh," this "snake," within us. We need His grace to give us eagerness and perseverance in prayer, fasting, spiritual work, and acts of mercy. 

It is crucial to recognize Babylon both within ourselves and in the world around us. We must cut all ties with it, finding no joy in walking through malls, playing computer games, or indulging in other worldly distractions. These things should feel foreign to us. We should not feel a sense of longing or attachment, thinking, "It’s so pleasant, but I can’t do it now—I’ll wait until Lent is over." No, we must reject Babylon entirely. We must declare, "I do not want Babylon in my life, not now, not ever." Even outside of fasting periods, we should strive to have nothing in common with Babylon.

May the Lord protect us from the spirit of mammon and grant us joy, strength, and wisdom. May He unite us to Himself and to one another through the Holy Eucharist and the movement of the Holy Spirit. Let us remain steadfast in our spiritual journey, resisting the allure of Babylon and striving to live in the light of Christ. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
