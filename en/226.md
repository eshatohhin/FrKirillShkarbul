# The Beast Woke Up on October 7th

Dear brothers and sisters, I was asked to comment on what is happening now in the Middle East, what began on October 7th, and of course, I'm not going to talk about just politics.  
We are very materialistic, and this is a sign of apostasy—that we care about what's in the news, what threats happen to the economy, to immigration, and things like that.  
But all of that is just a consequence of some more important spiritual events that are going on, as people reject Christ, reject God, and reject everything divine.  
This world loses its value, and eventually, people will choose a "savior" who will give them material satisfaction.  
And the question is: Is this fake Messiah, this Antichrist, whose coming is foretold, related to what is happening, what has just begun in the Middle East, and how is it going to develop?  
Just some ideas—I'm not going to make too many forecasts, but I can share my thoughts.  

First of all, this may not be the final project or the final coming of the Antichrist. This may be one of the rehearsals, one of the attempts to bring this key figure to power.  
And I'm saying this because, for the people who want the Antichrist to come and who have tremendous resources, the Holy Land, Israel, is the most important part.  
As for the Lord, He said, "The stone of stumbling, the stumbling stone," and the stone became Christ. Whoever didn't believe in Christ chose not to, and they fell.  
Salvation means obtaining the stone and not falling. In the same way, Jerusalem and the Third Temple, this mountain of the temple, for those who want to bring this fake Messiah, for them, this is the stone.  
So for them, everything revolves around this topic—the Third Temple and the coming of this "Savior," whom they think will be the Messiah but whom we know will be the Antichrist.  
We also know from the Holy Fathers, their interpretation of the Apocalypse, that Jerusalem is going to become the capital of this world kingdom of the Antichrist.  
So they also tell us that it's going to be all about Jerusalem. Knowing this, we can say that if what happened, what began a few days ago on October 7th, grows into a world event—you know what I mean, not just in the Middle East, not just involving Iran, but the whole world—then this is significant.  
We see this militarization going on everywhere. We have it here in Taiwan, in France, in Europe—we have it everywhere.  
If everybody, or almost everybody, is going to be pulled into this big event—I don't want to say this word—as a result, as an outcome of what is happening now in the Middle East, that means this is one of the biggest attempts, maybe the biggest up to now, to bring the fake Messiah.  
And it may be the final one, or it may be only one big rehearsal.  

Of course, don't believe the news, what they tell you—that some crazy guys decided to get on those, what they call them, paragliders or whatnot, and they went to kill and torture.  
This is a game. We have to know that there are people and forces behind this.  
We can say that the spirit of the Antichrist is behind this breakout that happened. And it will unfold according to some plan, give or take. But if they decided to go for this, they must have some plan.  
And I can tell you more: if they have this plan to begin the big one, the world one, they also have a plan for how to "save" it.  
And this plan of "saving" the world would involve bringing some "savior." Most likely, they already have this candidate for a savior—most likely.  

But there is another big question. The bringing of such a figure to world power doesn't involve just a political or economic enthronement, where they will make him this world leader.  
It's not that simple. The thing is, and they understand this, that they first need to implant into the minds of all the people in this world a love for a figure like that and for the order of the world that he will establish.

So this is not just a task of forcing people to accept him as the world leader. No. The task is that people would be craving, screaming for, and welcoming such a savior to come, along with the order that he will bring to this world.  
This is a more difficult task than simply using force, military, bombs, and the like to impose tyranny or dictatorship on everyone.  
No, they don’t want it to look like a dictatorship. So what we can say is that, first of all, I believe this is a long-term story. The destabilization is going to get worse and worse, at least until the elections in the U.S.  
At least for one year. Because they might be planning to bring about "salvation" beginning with that new government in the U.S. This is a game. This is a game. But people have to believe that it’s real.  
This is just a hypothesis. I’m not saying this is what’s going to happen. But in the case that this is a big war and they want it to be on a world scale, this is what’s going to happen. It’s going to get worse and worse, at least until that day.  
And later, we’ll see. What’s more important is the propaganda, information, and brainwashing that will go hand in hand with the military component.  
We will have this military component growing bigger and worse. But they must have the propaganda and brainwashing component running simultaneously. Otherwise, it will not succeed.  
But they know—they’ve learned over the last 20 centuries what’s involved. And what they also understand is that this has a mystical component to it. It’s not something they can completely plan, project, and make happen.  
They understand, and this is true, that such a figure—if this is indeed the Antichrist—has to be allowed by God to come and rule this world.  
This has to be allowed by God if the Lord sees that it’s time. The people are so far away. They don’t want anything divine.  
They are completely immersed in their sins and passions, so lowly, so earthly, so perverted, that now it’s time.  
It’s time to say, “Okay, let’s just finish all of this. They don’t want Me; let them have this guy.” And if this comes, this permission has to come from the Lord. Those who are trying to bring him to power cannot control this process.  
But they’re not going to wait. They’re not going to just sit there and do nothing. Their logic is to exert as much effort as they can to try to bring him to power.  
To hopefully prepare everything possible—so that his mindset, the deception he’s going to use, will already be implanted in the people.  
Leviathan will be living in each and every one. This they can try to achieve—to brainwash people so much that all of them are already instruments of the devil, devil-possessed.  
And then it will be logical. These two things will come together. So let us see what happens. Let us have no fear, but let us be mindful and watchful—not for political agendas, who is bombing whom, and things like that.  
What’s more important is this very subtle, persuasive, and sneaky way of capturing your conscience, of making you one of the slaves, one of the people who will welcome this new order.  
And this is what they’re doing. Most of the people around us are already like this. If you look around, you will see that most people are already hacked spiritually, mentally, and ideologically.  
And we’ll see what happens. So please, don’t take sides. Don’t say, “I’m on this side, I’m on that side.” Who wants to do this? Oh, this is the goal of Israel. No, this is China. Or some other leaders. Or this is some U.K. special forces. No, that’s Russia.  
This is all brainwashing. Most of what you see in the news—99% of it—is brainwashing. These categories are outdated. So please, don’t believe what you read or what you see. Don’t take sides.

Our side is Jesus Christ. We take His side. We love all people. We see that those who are now killing each other are brainwashed—all sides involved. Whoever gets caught up in that conflict is a victim of Leviathan.  
So let us pray. Let us have peace, strong faith, and trust in our Lord. Let us grow spiritually so that we are not attached to this world, to its values, or to its worries.  
Let our worries be with the Lord. Our hope, our trust is in Him and with Him. Only in this way will we be able to avoid all the deception of the Antichrist and the devil. Amen.  
May the Lord be with every one of you. Please, the minimum thing we must do is to stay alive. Stay alive. Avoid any harm to your health or your mental state.  
And the task—the true task—is our spiritual growth in our Lord and Savior, the true Messiah, Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless.
