# The Net of Christ vs. Nets of the Mammon

Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated the feast of the great apostles Peter and Paul, and today is the feast of the 12 apostles. We are now on this path of apostleship. After Pentecost, we are sent together with the apostles to fulfill this mission, and they are the greatest examples for us. From now until next year's great feast, we are in the time of Pentecost, a time of receiving the Lord's grace to accomplish this journey and to witness Christ's love to everyone.

To do this, I want to share with you an insight that I find very important. What does it mean to be an apostle? Simply put, it means to love Christ more than anything else, to reject the world, and to bring people into the net of the kingdom of heaven. You will be fishers of men. This call is not just for priests or missionaries but for every Christian who wants to follow Christ and truly become His disciple. This is the goal.

So, what does this mean, and how do we accomplish it? The apostles were able to fulfill their mission not merely because they traveled to many places or performed miracles. The first key was their spiritual life—their prayer, the power of their prayer, and their clear vision of what they needed to do. They understood the problems of this world. If you want to be a good fisherman, you need to understand the behavior of the fish and the conditions of the river or wherever you are fishing. Only then can you be successful.

The Apostle Paul tells us much about this world—how it lies in evil, how the mystery of lawlessness is developing, and how the man of sin will one day be revealed. He warns us about the rise of mammon, as the Lord Himself spoke of the prince of this world. All these things are interconnected—tradition, apocalypse, and the spiritual battle we face.

Today, I want to share something that I believe is key—both to our individual spirituality and to understanding what is happening in this world and how we can accomplish the apostolic task of bringing people to Christ. Over the last 150-170 years, since the mid-19th century, religiosity in the world has declined tremendously. Churches are emptying. Wherever you go, you will see churches that are either closed, demolished, repurposed into kindergartens, condominiums, or other uses, or they are half-empty and filled mostly with older people. In some cases, they have become places of heretical sects, like charismatic groups that attract young people with their craziness. But this is not true repentance, Christ-centered prayer, or worship. It is something else entirely—akin to demon worship.

Why is this happening? Even in other parts of the world, such as Asia, materialism and communism have taken hold, as seen in the Soviet Union and other nations. These countries embraced the materialistic and utopian idea of building a socialist paradise in this world, abandoning religion in the process. While some are now returning to religion, it is not the same as before. New forms of Buddhism and Hinduism have emerged, but they are different from their traditional roots. Similarly, many Jewish and Muslim communities have become more materialistic. People today care more about a happy, prosperous life, money, comfort, and a better lifestyle—earthly things, mammon. This "mammonization" of the world is happening on a large scale.

Why is this the case? Most people today no longer feel the need for religion. Instead, they turn to occultism, magic, yoga, or other surrogates. But these are not true religion. Why has this happened? Why has the place that was once prepared for the Lord now been occupied by something else?

And this is why I urge people, even those who already accept Christ in their minds, to pray, repent, and read the Gospel. Yet, many respond, "I'm busy with something else." Even Christians have become more materialistic and secular. Why is this happening? Why have we become so consumed by material pursuits compared to a hundred years ago? Consumption has skyrocketed—not just because there is more available, but because people crave more and are never satisfied. What is going on here? This is the world we are facing.

Despite all these problems, when we think about the Antichrist—a ruler who will one day come to rule the entire world and demand worship as God—we might say, "That seems impossible." Imagine someone today declaring, "Worship me as God; I am your savior, and I rule the world." Those familiar with the Bible would recognize this as the Antichrist and reject him. It may not seem plausible now, but we know it will happen. Today, I want to share the key that will open the path to the hearts of everyone—a key that is already at work in the world. This is not something unimaginable; it is already happening, and we can see its effects in us.

The Kabbalah and Talmud emerged after the Jewish people rejected Christ. What existed before was merely a rehearsal, but the real development of texts like the Zohar occurred after the majority of Jews rejected Christ. They made this choice. I am not anti-Semitic, but we must understand the essence of this. The Holy Fathers, including the Apostle Paul, spoke of those who claim to be Jews but are, in reality, a "synagogue of Satan." This is echoed in the writings of John Chrysostom and other Church Fathers. When Talmudic Jews gather—I am not speaking of all Jews, but those immersed in Talmud and Kabbalah—the "god" they worship is, in essence, Satan.

What does Kabbalah teach? It claims that the unification of the world will occur when every living being awakens the "spark of God" within their heart or soul. This "light of God" will shine within them, eliminating the need for war and conflict. The world will become one, ruled by the "King of Kings," the Mashiach or Savior. However, this "spark" or "light" is not of God but of Satan. It is the beast that will awaken in everyone's heart. The various movements of emancipation and enlightenment we see today are awakening this beast. It is complex and has many manifestations, but it is already at work.

Often, when we hear that people have become more conscious, smarter, or enlightened, what it really means is that they have abandoned conscience, tradition, love, family, and human nature. They have been "awakened" or "enlightened" by a new, false conscience. This is why people are drifting away from Christ. They live and think under the guidance of another spirit—not the Spirit of God.

In the Gospel of Luke, chapter 9, we see that even the apostles were influenced by a wrong spirit. Let us read verses 54 to 56: When James and John saw that the Samaritans refused to welcome Jesus as He traveled to Jerusalem, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them?" But Jesus rebuked them, saying, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are of, for the Son of Man did not come to destroy lives but to save them." Even the apostles, at times, were guided by a spirit contrary to Christ's mission. This serves as a warning for us today.

So when James and John saw the Samaritans rejecting Jesus, they said, "Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?" But Jesus turned and rebuked them, saying, "You do not know what spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them." Then they went to another village. 

The disciples had this idea: "Let’s destroy them; they’re in our way. Let’s call down fire from heaven and wipe out this village, just as Elijah did once." In the Old Testament, many events were prophetic, pointing to what would be fully revealed by God through Christ in the end times. For example, the idea that wealth signifies God’s blessing appears in the Old Testament, but even there, it is conditional and prophetic, pointing to the true riches—the spirit of love, the eradication of sin, and the fight against passions and sin, not against people. 

The disciples were operating under a wrong spirit, and Jesus corrected them: "You do not know what spirit you are of." As Christians, we often do not understand the spirit we are supposed to have. Today, I want to address two major types of anti-Christian spirits that we can see in ourselves and in the world around us: the spirit of the beast and the spirit of the harlot of Babylon. 

The **spirit of the beast** is aggressive. It is a spirit of rebellion against God, tradition, and the fruits of the Holy Spirit. We see this spirit in movements like Protestantism, which often rejects the fruits of the Holy Spirit, and in various revolutions, feminism, and other modern ideologies. It is a spirit of destruction and hostility toward what is holy. 

The **spirit of the harlot of Babylon** is different but related. It is a spirit of compromise, tolerance, and spiritual adultery. It says, "Everything is fine," but at the expense of truth and love for God. It tolerates everything, but there is no truth. Just as a harlot tolerates anyone for money, this spirit is tied to materialism and the idea that everything can be bought or sold. These two spirits—the beast and the harlot—work hand in hand. 

Sometimes we betray God, and other times we fight against what God has sent. This is happening within each of us. Jesus called His generation "adulterous," but we are even more so today. Even Christians, including Orthodox Christians, struggle with these spirits, though we have more tools to fight them. 

We must first destroy the spirit of the beast and the harlot within our own hearts. If we are aware of these spirits, we will not give the Antichrist the key to subdue us. We will also be able to help others break free from the grip of Satan. Many people are drawn by these spirits without even realizing it. This is where stubbornness comes from—the attitude of, "I know better what the Gospel means. I don’t need the Holy Fathers or tradition. I know better." This is the spirit of protest, where people make themselves gods and become hostile to anything that challenges them. It is the spirit of Cain, the beast. 

To resist these spirits, we must return to humility, prayer, and the guidance of the Church. Only then can we truly follow Christ and fulfill our apostolic mission.

Or you might fall into the mindset of, "Everything goes, everything is fine. Just enjoy your life, make money, and do whatever you want." This is the spirit of Babylon, the spirit of the harlot of Babylon. Let us be aware of this, brothers and sisters. As we stand on this path to follow Christ and become His apostles, let us recognize that unless we root out these spirits from our own hearts, nothing will save us from the Antichrist. 

You might think, "I’ve read all about these conspiracies, I know everything, and I would never reject Christ. No matter what happens, I will remain loyal to Him." But if you do not confront the problem I’ve just described within your own heart, you will betray Him—100%. In that moment, you will agree, you will say "yes," one way or another. The spirit will drag you in that direction. This is why, in the end times, people will not be able to repent. The Lord will send disasters to call them to repentance, but they will remain stuck in their enmity toward God. They will blaspheme God for sending these disasters, but they will not repent. They will be completely consumed by the spirits of Cain and Babylon. 

Then, another "savior" will come, saying, "I will save you. I will solve your problems. Just connect to my system, and I will provide you with food and everything you need." Let us be aware of this, brothers and sisters. Let us remain spiritually vigilant and put effort into our spiritual lives. Only in this way can we truly become His disciples and bring the love of Christ—the testimony of His love and self-sacrifice—to all the people we meet in our daily lives. 

May the Lord’s blessing, wisdom, humility, and love be with you. God bless.
