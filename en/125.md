# New Year opens new horizons for good or for evil

Dear brothers and sisters, I wish you a Happy New Year, and I also wish you the Lord's blessings in this New Year for every good deed, to bear more fruit of faith, to strengthen your walk in Christ, and to open new horizons in your spiritual life.  

As we enter this New Year, everyone feels that there is something new about life, which is relative, right? Yet, there is still this universal feeling people have—a sense of new expectations, a hope for something new that is going to happen. We don’t know what this year will bring, nor do we know what our lives will look like by the end of it. For some, this uncertainty brings fear; for others, it brings intrigue or an expectation of something positive.  

But for us, it can serve as a reminder that we live in newness of life. We have a new being within us, having become new creations after baptism, after entering the Holy Church. This new life is a new form of existence, a new way of thinking, and a new worldview. This year, this New Year, we are called to bridge new frontiers and set new goals.  

To understand what this is all about, we need to recognize that there are two ways of transcending boundaries. There is one way of growth in Christ, and there is another way of being broken. When we break something, we also, in a sense, go beyond limits, but this is the wrong direction because it leaves us broken and without hope. If we are unable to be vessels that the Holy Spirit can fill and build up, we cannot grow or accomplish anything.  

Today, I want to explain how these two paths differ. The Lord said, "I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now." He promised to send the Holy Spirit, who would come and teach the disciples everything. We often feel that it’s not enough—we still want to draw closer to God, we still lack His wisdom, we desire more. We recognize our lack of virtue and many other things, and we are willing to transcend our old ways of thinking and doing. We are open to this newness, to this renewal, if you will.  

However, this renewal is not the same as the worldly renewal, reset, or breach of conscience where people’s hearts and minds are hacked. What is the difference? First, where does this wrong breach come from?  

There are two problems with the "old man" that we carry within us. The first is that we are very limited in how we see things. Sometimes, the whole society thinks in the same way. They watch the news, listen to each other, and live within a kind of shell, unable to break free. The internet doesn’t help; it often reinforces this shell. In developed countries, there is one kind of shell; in others, like India, there is another. Each culture or context creates its own shell. Whenever we lack access to Christ, we are trapped in some kind of shell. Sometimes, after a certain age, people become so fixed in their ways of thinking that it seems impossible to change them. That is one problem.  

The second problem, which may be even worse, is when people break out of this shell—especially young people—through new trends, fashion, music, or other influences. This can make you think differently, innovate, and "think outside the box," as they say. It breaks your worldview and introduces something new. But this often comes from passions and is what some call "enlightenment." The devil tries to mimic what God is doing, whispering, "Oh, you are enlightened now. You are part of a new trend, a new generation, up to date with the wave of this world." And it’s true—you begin to embrace the so-called wisdom of this world, which is, in reality, foolishness. To God, to Christ, this is madness. He has no part in it.  

Therefore, we must distinguish between these two paths. Let us seek the true renewal that comes from Christ, not the counterfeit enlightenment of the world.

For example, when you watch bad movies—whether they contain violence, horror, or other harmful content—it may seem like enlightenment. You might think, "Oh, this is something new, something I’ve never experienced before. It’s fresh and exciting." But in reality, you are breaking something good inside yourself. You are accepting a false sense of novelty, which, after a few exposures, reveals itself as empty and meaningless. Yet, in that moment, you believe it’s something groundbreaking, something that pushes your limits.  

This raises the question: What are you transcending, and how are you transcending it? There are two sources of this brokenness, this force that comes and shatters you.  

The first source is internal—your passions. It could be impatience, despondency, grief, or depression. When you’re in such a state, you can’t think clearly. You feel lost and broken. Or it could be greed, where you see people only as sources of money, unable to perceive the bigger picture. Lust reduces others to mere objects of carnal desire, stripping away their humanity. Vainglory makes you obsessed with showing off, and any strong passion narrows your perspective, breaking your worldview into fragments. You develop a "clip mind," seeing only what your passions allow.  

This brokenness stems from the fall of Adam. When Adam sinned, he lost his union with God. He saw the world in a distorted way—wild animals as threats, his own nakedness as shame, and so on. He gained a kind of knowledge, but it was false because it came at the cost of his relationship with God. The wisdom he once had was lost, replaced by a worldly "wisdom" that is, in truth, madness.  

Another example of how passions break your conscience can be seen in the way a child perceives their father. A young child sees their father as a whole person—a guide, a source of love, education, and wisdom. The child looks up to their father, knowing he has more knowledge and experience. But someone else, like a creditor, might see the father only as an economic agent—someone who owes money or owns property. This person doesn’t care about the father’s inner world or personality. To them, the father is just a means to an end. They might think this perspective is wisdom, but to the Lord, it is detestable.  

Christ said, "Unless you become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven." The worldly wisdom we gain as adults—calculating, self-serving, and narrow-minded—is not the wisdom of God. It is a barrier to entering His kingdom.  

In this New Year, I pray that we do not seek new worldly wisdom but instead shed all the unnecessary baggage we carry. Let us strive to gain wisdom in Christ, the true wisdom that renews and transforms.  

Another reason our minds can be broken is external—technology. Platforms like TikTok, for instance, can fragment your attention, leaving you nervous and unsettled. Commercials and ads bombard us with images and messages designed to influence us. Many of these technologies, including NLP (neuro-linguistic programming), are crafted to program and manipulate our thoughts.  

Let us be vigilant, guarding our hearts and minds against these influences. Let us seek the renewal that comes from Christ, not the false enlightenment of the world. May this New Year be a time of true growth in Him.

They will study your mind through big data, collecting information about who you are, using AI technologies to analyze and influence you. This, too, breaks your mind and conscience. All of this is presented as a way to break the old and bring you into something new, but this "new" is merely broken—it is not something good or constructive. It does not build you up but tears you down.  

So, we must seek another kind of wisdom. How do we distinguish the renewal that comes from Christ from the so-called renewal offered by the world? The renewal from Christ builds your inner self. It makes you healthier, gives you a more unified perception of the world and your mission within it. It fills you with the love of Christ, makes you more humble, and lessens your ego. You become more willing to serve Christ and others.  

In contrast, the worldly "renewal" breaks your new self in Christ. It destroys anything good within you, making you spiritually sick. It feeds your ego, your worldliness, and the old, animalistic nature within you. This is a clear sign that such "wisdom" is fake, false, worldly, and destructive.  

Throughout history, we have seen many worldviews emerge. There was the Catholic scholastic worldview, the Enlightenment worldview, the scientific worldview, the capitalist worldview, and now the postmodern, posthumanist worldview. Far from being progress, this is a degradation—a return to something primitive and basic.  

Even within the Church, we can fall into limited or superficial worldviews. We might have a rosy, idealized view of Orthodox life or a shallow understanding of Christian living. These limitations exist not only on an individual level but also on a communal level.  

To transcend these limitations, we must turn to Christ. We must ask Him to give us His wisdom—not a wisdom focused on the material world, which is secondary, but a wisdom that reveals spiritual reality. This wisdom allows us to see things comprehensively, to grasp the spiritual reality in people, and to recognize each person as an image of God. It fosters respect and genuine interest in every individual, helping us to see God more clearly through our interactions with others.  

As we grow in Christ, we gain new knowledge and new experiences. This is the true renewal we seek.  

This year, I hope we can achieve two goals. First, to restore the broken self—fragmented by passions and technological influences—and second, to grow in Christ, reaching new limits and obtaining new wisdom in Him.  

May the Lord bless us, guide us, and teach us humility and virtue. May He help us to be His witnesses in this world. May His kingdom come, and His will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  

Happy New Year, and God bless you all.
