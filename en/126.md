# African clergy received by Moscow

Dear brothers and sisters, Merry Christmas to all of you. Today I am in Tainan, and tonight we will have a baptism here in the ocean. This is our first baptism in Tainan, and tomorrow we will have a celebration—a Christmas Eve celebration in Kaohsiung, also in the south of Taiwan. These holidays bring joy and the expectation of the Savior coming into this world. It is also a time of strict fasting, and we know that during strict fasting, temptations arise. This year, temptations have also come upon the whole Church. I think this is a matter concerning the entire Orthodox Church, as we hear this news regarding Africa.

Today, it is unfortunate, but I need to talk about unpleasant things during this time because we must pray, "Lead us not into temptation." We need to avoid any temptations, and I just want to share my view on this topic, on this matter which has just happened. This decision was made just a few days ago, and there is a lot of discussion, as well as many attempts to demonize the Russian Church. This is why it is important for us to think about it, to pray about it, and to pray that the problem does not worsen—that the Lord can guide His Church in the right direction and grant wisdom and right decisions to those who make these decisions.

Now, there are two positions. What am I talking about? I am talking about the Russian Church receiving clergy in Africa from the Patriarchate of Alexandria—clergy who wish to join and who do not support the decision of the Patriarch of Alexandria to support those schismatics in Ukraine. These are hostile and politicized individuals who call themselves Orthodox and were recently accepted by Constantinople. This was an attempt to legalize these schismatics, which has created a lot of tension, with people using violence to take churches, causing great confusion and pain in Ukraine and in the hearts of millions of faithful. This is a truly significant and serious problem that will have ripple effects for many years, perhaps even centuries. So, we need to think about this, and what has happened now is one of those effects.

I am now at the train station, and they are making announcements. I hope it doesn’t affect the sound too much. So, there are two positions about what was done. In my view, both positions are wrong. The first position says that what was done by the Russian Church is wrong—that it is violence against violence. This violence was initiated by Constantinople, and now it is a retaliation.

So, it's non-canonical; it breaks all the rules of the Church. It is not Christian because it is retaliation. If you don't do that, you need to turn the other cheek when you are struck on one cheek. And there are other criticisms as well. This is one position.  

The other position is the opposite. It says that it was the right decision and a very good thing that happened. This decision is right because, if you don't act, they will invade other places, and the situation will grow worse and worse. Now that it has been done, it is very good. Many problems in Africa will be solved because there was a significant issue with bishops not living in Africa and not truly caring for the African people. There was segregation—higher-class foreigners, Greeks, and lower-class Black Africans—and many other problems, such as using material goods to attract people and other unhealthy practices. Now, all of this will be resolved because Russia has stepped in, and the mission will develop, along with many other things.  

This is the other position, which, in my view, is also wrong.  

The third position, which I believe is correct—and I do not impose my view on everyone; this is just my perspective—is that we will only know what is right after many years, perhaps even centuries, with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. When we see the fruits of what has been done today and what is happening now, it will bear its results, good or bad, over time. Only then will we be able to say whether it was the right decision or the wrong one. For now, we can only speak from our current perspective.  

So, it may be wrong. I am not insisting that this is the only right decision. I have discussed this with many priests, and even among Russian priests, there are differing opinions. After all these discussions, this is the conclusion I have reached. I am simply sharing my view and my conclusion as of today. If my view changes, I will also inform you. But for now, I see it this way: given the situation, which is very radical and extreme—an emergency situation—what was done is right.  

What was done by the Russian Church, opening these two dioceses in Africa and receiving those clergy, was the right decision. However, what happened is still a bad thing. We would rather not have it happen, but it would be even worse if it didn't.  

Why am I saying this? First, this is not retaliation or violence against violence. It is like being robbed and taking action to stop the robber. You are not robbing them in return, but you are protecting yourself. Perhaps you even need to use something like pepper spray to stop them because they are possessed by the desire to steal from you or even harm you. This is not retaliation; it is an act of stopping harm.  

There is a view that the entire Orthodox Church needs to come together and declare, "Alexandria is wrong; Alexandria is schismatic," and only then can something be done in Africa. This logic is flawed because we do not have a council declaring Rome heretical or schismatic. We have been waiting for such a council for a thousand years, but it has not happened. Yet, we know they are heretics; it is common knowledge among the Orthodox. The saints, over centuries, have recognized this as harmful.  

It has been proven over the long term that cutting ties with the Catholics was the right decision at that time. Otherwise, the entire Church would have been corrupted. Similarly, at this time, we do not have the opportunity to gather such a council.

And if you're being robbed, you don't have time to call the police and wait for them or for some committee to come and say, "Oh yes, he's robbing your house, so now let's take action." No, you need to decide on the spot what to do because the robbers don't wait for a commission—they just rob you. This is what Constantinople and Alexandria are doing.  

Yes, it is breaking canons. But in extreme situations, such as when someone is dying, we perform baptism in a non-canonical way. If we don’t have water, we can use sand. It can be done not only by priests but also by laypersons or even non-Orthodox individuals if necessary. The Church recognizes this as valid because it is necessary to baptize someone before they die. This is another example of how, in extreme situations, it is sometimes necessary to act contrary to the canons. Such exceptions actually prove the validity of the canons, as they highlight the importance of the rules while acknowledging that extraordinary circumstances may require flexibility.  

Perhaps this is one of those situations. At this point, Africa has only a few hundred priests, while Ukraine is much larger, with perhaps 15–20 thousand priests and tens of millions of faithful. Right now, this is not just a struggle for Africa; it is a struggle to protect the Church in Ukraine, which is being severely harmed by the decisions of Constantinople and Alexandria. This is like dealing with robbers and intruders—you cannot just stand by and watch. You must act to stop them from expanding their influence, from convincing other churches to accept their actions, or from invading further. Something must be done to halt this.  

The question is, what will happen next? What will this lead to? I feel that this conflict will not be resolved in a few years. It may take decades, perhaps even centuries, and it may never be fully resolved. The situation we are facing shows us that darkness in this world is growing and is increasingly influencing the Church. The Church is now very large, with many people, and as a result, it is deeply attached to this world. It is influenced too much by politics, money, and many other worldly concerns. This is the reality we must confront and overcome, though the problems are significant.  

What else is likely to happen? Most likely, Africa will follow a pattern similar to what we see in South America, North America, and Asia, where there are parallel jurisdictions. Different patriarchates open parishes that belong directly to their jurisdictions. This is not good; it is far from ideal. But it is the outcome of our weakness and the reality we live in. At this point, there is little we can do to change it. This is most likely what will happen in Africa.  

The Lord gave Alexandria the opportunity to be responsible for the spiritual care of Africa. This began in the 1930s. Before that, the Patriarch of Alexandria was responsible only for Egypt. But after the 1930s, he was given authority over the entire African continent. This was a great responsibility, but it has been mishandled, especially with the actions taken regarding Ukraine. This was a significant mistake by the Patriarch of Alexandria, and I believe it is his greatest sin.  

As a result of these actions, we are losing the proper structure of the Church, where one patriarch or bishop oversees a diocese, and everyone is united under that bishop. Different churches may send people, but they all coordinate under the local bishop. We will no longer have this structure in Africa, at least not for now. Perhaps it will remain this way forever—only time will tell.

Let us pray that the Lord does not allow any further splits or the acceleration of this conflict, which weakens the Church. May we remain united in love. At the end of the day, it is we, the people, who must love one another and love everyone else. We must refrain from judging others. Please avoid judging people. Instead, let us pray for the Church and ask the Lord to come and abide in us, especially during this Christmas season.  

May the Lord grant you wisdom, love, and strength during these holy days. Merry Christmas to every one of you, and God bless.
