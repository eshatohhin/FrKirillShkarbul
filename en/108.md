# Is the world falling under satan’s control in modern times

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord has called us to be awake.  
To be awake means to be spiritually vigilant, to pray, to control our passions, and to avoid temptations.  
It also means understanding what is happening in the world we live in, so that we can fight against the devil and all the evil that exists, and better carry out our Christian mission and testimony.  

Today, I want to speak about what is happening in the world now. This situation has been unfolding for over 100 years, and it has changed dramatically since the 18th and early 19th centuries. What kind of world do we live in today? How different is it from the past?  

Externally, we can see significant physical changes. We have advanced technology, communication, and science. There has been tremendous development in travel, phones, and other such innovations. The economy has grown significantly, and people can buy and consume more than they used to. On the surface, it appears to be progress.  

However, at the same time, we see—especially now—that moral values are deteriorating. This is evident everywhere. The family unit is being destroyed. Divorces are becoming more frequent, and people are increasingly living without marriage. Children are left without parents or abandoned more than ever before. There is a vast disparity between wealthy and poor countries, and even within wealthy nations, there are stark inequalities. Some people live in ghettos, and many unhealthy phenomena are prevalent.  

We also see that culture is perishing. In the past, we had many composers, poets, and writers. People created folk songs, and culture was deeply rooted in the community. Now, we no longer have such a sense of community. Instead, we have atomized individuals, each absorbed in social networks, chatting away. It is a different world, a different lifestyle—one that is spiritually deprived and impoverished.  

Why is this happening? One reason is that the devil is actively working to pull the majority of people away from God’s plan. We must recognize that many saints and extraordinary individuals who followed Christ were often different even before they began their spiritual journey. Consider the apostles: while some were fishermen, we do not know much about their past lives. They were called by Christ because they were different. Similarly, many early Christians were marginalized—former prostitutes, the poor, orphans, and those with health issues. Even the Apostle Paul, who was once a persecutor of the Church, was a unique individual before his conversion.  

These saints and early Christians were not the "normal" or "average" people of their time. They were often outliers, set apart from the masses. On the other hand, the great evildoers—figures like Hitler, Napoleon, and other notorious individuals—were also not ordinary. They were perverse, maniacal, and stood apart from the general population.  

In summary, some people consciously serve the Lord. They strive to be with Christ, making Him the goal of their lives. They engage in missions and dedicate themselves to His work. Others, however, consciously or subconsciously serve the devil. They may pursue their own selfish desires, but ultimately, they serve evil.  

As Christians, we must remain vigilant, discerning the times, and steadfast in our mission to resist evil and uphold God’s truth in this spiritually impoverished world.

And sometimes we call them antichrists—plural.  
These are the people who bring the most suffering to humanity. Very often, they rise to positions of power, becoming rulers and leaders.  

For the majority of people, before the changes that began around 150 years ago or even earlier, life followed a different paradigm. For thousands of years, people generally lived in a framework of following God and striving to do His will. These individuals did not typically have their own grand ideas; they were followers rather than leaders. Even if they led a company or enterprise, they were essentially following the trends of their time. If everyone baked bread, they baked bread. If everyone upheld strong family values, they did the same.  

Of course, every country and every age had its share of sins—stealing, cheating, and other immoral behaviors were present among the masses. These people were not holy, but overall, the general trend of society was more aligned with God’s will than it is today.  

Throughout history, there has always been a spiritual competition: God leading humanity toward good, and the devil trying to pull people away. This shift did not happen overnight. It was a gradual process, prepared by the devil over centuries. However, there came a breaking point—a great success for the devil in pulling the masses away from following Christ and toward serving his own purposes. The devil sought to become their master.  

The revolutions we have witnessed are a prime example of this. Promises of liberation, freedom, and equality were made: "You will be your own lords, you will be like God." This echoes the first temptation of Satan in the Garden of Eden, when he told Adam and Eve, "You will be free, you will be knowledgeable, you will be like God." Similarly, modern ideologies promise education, opportunities, and prosperity, but with the condition of rejecting authority—whether monarchical or divine—and embracing democracy.  

However, this does not work. When people were deceived by the calls of liberalism and democracy, they abandoned God. They no longer wanted Him. It is not that every ruler represented God—many were far from holy—but the systems of the past were not as controlling as they are today. Rulers had limited lifespans and could only enact policies for a short time before being replaced by others with different agendas. They lacked the tools of modern control: media, public education systems designed to indoctrinate, and the ability to imprison large portions of the population.  

In the past, rulers—whom we might also call antichrists—were limited in their ability to cause widespread harm. They could persecute the Church, but such actions were temporary and limited in scope. They did not have the means to systematically destroy family values, culture, or religion. They could not use movies to promote free love or other destructive ideologies. They could not turn entire populations into servants of their own desires.  

In contrast, modern antichrists are far more effective instruments of the devil. They have access to advanced tools of control and manipulation, allowing them to systematically undermine spiritual values, destroy families, and erode culture. They are more deeply connected to demonic forces, receiving their messages and carrying out their plans with greater precision and impact.  

In the past, humanity walked a more spiritual path. While far from perfect, society was generally oriented toward God. Today, we face a world that is increasingly spiritually deprived, where the devil’s influence is more pervasive and destructive than ever before. As Christians, we must remain vigilant, resisting these forces and striving to uphold God’s truth in a world that has largely turned away from Him.

Now, humanity has fallen to the level of the belly, like a snake.  
Why is the devil depicted as a snake? In Genesis chapter 3, we see that the serpent moves on its belly and consumes filth. Similarly, the devil wants people to live only for their bellies—to focus solely on material concerns. Today, people worry only about making money, buying things, paying bills, consuming, and enjoying material pleasures. Everything revolves around material life, consumption, and the utility gained from acquiring and using material goods. Spiritual concerns are pushed aside.  

This is why we no longer have a rich culture. The spiritual component of life has been stripped away. The devil achieves this by creating trends. He sets a trend, and everyone follows. One moment, everyone must do a certain dance; the next, everyone must wear jeans or go digital. If you don’t adapt, you’re left behind. If you don’t learn the latest apps or digital tools, your company will fail, and you’ll be marginalized. You’ll be seen as outdated, a relic of the past.  

The devil uses two main tactics to enforce these trends: persuasion and fear. He either convinces people that they love the trend, creating a delusion, or he frightens them into compliance. If you don’t follow the trend, you’ll be excluded, left behind, or even destroyed. Some people follow trends willingly, while others feel they have no choice.  

For us as Christians, the first step is to free ourselves from these trends. We must maintain spiritual independence. If everyone is on Facebook, for example, we can use it cautiously but keep a healthy distance. We must not immerse ourselves in it or let it control us.  

Another way the devil succeeds is by exploiting our social nature. We are influenced by those around us—in school, in society, and in our communities. The devil uses this to his advantage. His ultimate goal is to control the "market," so to speak—to dominate humanity. Over the past 150 years, he has been working to pull people away from God, especially those who were not consciously following Christ. His ambition is to create a world where everyone follows his lead, leaving God behind.  

The method the devil uses is akin to Trotskyism—a perpetual revolution. The devil is a revolutionary. He constantly tells us that what we have now is not good enough, that we need something new, something better. He encourages us to break away from what we have, to liberate ourselves from tradition and authority. But this revolution is against God. It seeks to pull people away from Him.  

God, in His mercy, allows natural disasters, viruses, and other challenges to occur as wake-up calls. He wants people to repent and return to Him. Some do, realizing they were wrong. But the devil continues his struggle, trying to make people revolt against God in every aspect of life—how they think, how they behave, how they form families. Step by step, he works to entrap humanity in his own kingdom, the kingdom of the Antichrist.  

The devil is like a monkey imitating God. He tries to create his own version of a kingdom, but it is a twisted, hollow imitation. As Christians, we must remain vigilant, resisting his influence and staying true to God’s will in a world that is increasingly drawn toward materialism and rebellion against divine authority.

The devil whispers, "Why should we be under God? We can have our own kingdom, and I will be the boss, and you will be my subjects." This is the essence of his deception. He promises liberation from God, but in reality, this so-called freedom leads to enslavement.  

In the parable of the debtor (Matthew 18:23-35), Jesus illustrates this truth. The debtor cannot repay what he owes, and the master commands, "Sell him, his wife, his children, and all that he has, and repay me." To "sell" here means to hand someone over to another master—Satan. This is the tragic outcome of rejecting God: we do not become free; we become slaves to the devil. We serve Mammon, the god of wealth and materialism.  

This is exactly what is happening in the world today—on a massive scale. People believe they are liberating themselves from God, but in reality, they are falling into the devil's trap. They become enslaved to their desires, their greed, and their selfishness.  

We must understand what is happening around us and within us. We must recognize the devil's influence in our lives and in the lives of those around us. Our task is not to lose this battle but to resist the devil's schemes. We must destroy his influence in our hearts and in the world.  

Our goal is to find Christ and serve Him consciously, not unconsciously. We must seek the Lord, His salvation, and follow Him with full awareness and dedication. May the Lord help us in this struggle. May He give us the heart to resist temptation, strengthen our faith, and help us overcome the "Leviathan" within us—our passions, our old selves, and our selfishness.  

May God teach us His wisdom, His humility, and His holiness. May He guide us to live in a way that glorifies Him and resists the devil's lies. God bless us all as we strive to walk in His light and truth.
