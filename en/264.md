# Why even Saints needed more time for repentance

Dear brothers and sisters, there is a great need to talk about repentance.  
The Lord Himself and the apostles preached, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."  
Unless we repent, we will not receive the kingdom of heaven.  
Yet, very often, we take repentance for granted.  
We repent once, and then a new life begins, and everything seems fine—our sins are forgiven, so we think there is no need to talk about repentance anymore. This is a grave mistake.  
No repentance, no Christ; no repentance, no kingdom of heaven; no repentance, no salvation.  

In the Orthodox Church, we understand that we must repent continually.  
However, our repentance is often—indeed, most of the time—very superficial.  
We might read a book about major sins and compare our behavior to what is written.  
If something doesn’t align, we repent.  
Some people don’t even open such books, so they don’t know what to repent for.  
Therefore, today, there is a need to talk about deep repentance.  
What does it mean to repent deeply?  

Some saints exhibited very unusual behaviors.  
We see that certain saints repented constantly, weeping for their sins.  
For example, Saint Ephraim the Syrian wept for his sins every night.  
We might wonder: Did he not trust that the Lord had forgiven him?  
Why weep for your sins every night, all night long? Isn’t that strange?  

Or consider Saint Sisoy the Great, who was like God on earth.  
He was a great saint who performed miracles and had thousands of disciples learning the spiritual life from him, witnessing his great virtues.  
Yet, on his deathbed, he was speaking with someone, and his disciples asked, "Whom are you speaking with?"  
He replied, "The angels have come for my soul, and I am asking them to give me more time to repent."  
They told him, "You don’t need repentance, Abba."  
But he responded, "Brethren, I do not even know if I have ever begun to repent."  
Then he passed away, and his face shone like the sun.  

These words are very strange.  
He didn’t know if he had repented or even begun to repent.  
What does true repentance mean?  
We will see that the more we engage in true repentance, the holier our lives become, and the fewer passions we have.  
Paradoxically, the more we feel distant from God, the more Christ lives in us.  

What I have just said may sound paradoxical.  
Human logic tells us that either you are holy or you are not.  
If you are holy, you have no passions, you shine, and you are fine.  
You know you will be saved because you already have the kingdom of heaven in your heart.  
But in reality, this is not how it works.  

How does it work, then?  
First, let us recall that we have the "nous," which is the mind—not the ordinary mind, but the ascetic mind.  
We also have our reasoning or intellect, called "logos" in Greek.  
The "nous" is not about thinking; it is about seeing.  
It is called the eye of the soul, or spiritual eyes or ears, listening to the will of God, His commandments, and His calling.  
It sees the great treasures in habits, perceives truth, understands how things are, and reveals who we truly are.  

When saints saw who they were, humility arose within them because they discovered the vast distance between themselves and God.  
They saw how miserable, wretched, and filthy they were, and how enslaved their will was by self-love.  
When Adam and Eve sinned, their love for God turned into love for themselves.  
They loved themselves more, and this self-love gave rise to egoism.  
Egoism can be individualistic, communal, or even nationalistic.  
If you love only your family above God, that is egoistic.  
If you love only your nation above God, that is also egoistic.  
It can even manifest as altruism for the sake of vainglory—doing good deeds so that people praise you.  
This is still a form of spiritual self-satisfaction.  
You can even be spiritually egoistic.

You may drop everything and care only about your own salvation. This, too, is egoism.  
So we see that everything can be egoistic—even spiritual efforts, deeds of mercy, prayer, anything.  
It can all be rooted in egoism. The Holy Fathers saw this clearly. They saw how deep sin runs, how much they loved themselves instead of loving God.  
They realized they did not truly love God. As your mind heals and you grow spiritually, you begin to see this more clearly.  
The healing comes, but the more healing you experience, the more you see how far you still fall short.  
You begin to recover your love for God, but the more you recover, the more you realize it is still not enough.  
It remains weak. In fact, we are not even at the beginning of this path.  

Saint Peter of Damascene says that when you repent, you will see your sins as numerous as the grains of sand on a beach.  
That many. And of course, if you see your sins as so numerous, you will not accuse others.  
You will love people. You will think everyone else is holy because, in comparison, you might see only one or two faults in them,  
while your own sins are as countless as the sand on the shore. This brings true humility.  
It brings true love, a lack of anger, and a lack of judgment toward others.  
This is what it means to judge yourself. If you judge yourself, you will not be subject to judgment later by the Lord.  
This is true repentance. Without continuous, deep repentance, there is no salvation.  
There is no Gospel. There is no need to perform deeds of mercy if you lack true repentance.  
There is no need for mission work, prayer, or even studying the Holy Scriptures if you do not care and do not have repentance.  

This is why the rise of Protestantism was such a great success for the enemy.  
It removed the need for repentance altogether. This was a great victory for the devil.  
It created a form of Christianity that was hollow, devoid of spiritual power, and blinded by self-reliance.  
This is the harm of heresy, the spirit of heresy. But this is not our topic today.  

Let us think deeply about these things.  
This uncertainty about whether you are saved or not is revealed when you examine your will.  
How corrupt is your will? At the end of your life, you may realize that your will was not aligned with God’s.  
You might think you are with God—you pray, go to church, help people, and do good deeds.  
But at the end of the day, you may discover that you did it all for yourself.  
All for vainglory, to be praised, for self-satisfaction, or for some other selfish reason—not because you truly love God.  
This is why even saints often doubted whether they would be saved. Most of them were not sure.  

There is nothing discouraging about this.  
On the contrary, it should encourage us to strive even harder spiritually—continuously, every day, every hour, every minute.  
May the Lord grant us this vigilance, this heart, this broken heart.  
The Lord will not despise a broken heart.  
This broken, repentant heart does not mean you are always gloomy or depressed.  
No. When our heart is repentant, we see our separation from God. We see ourselves as worthy of hell.  
Yet, at that moment of truth, when we realize the sickness and darkness within us, we also see hope.  
We see the light, the source of light that shines and exposes our darkness.  
This light gives us great hope and love. We see that He is the Savior, the only hope, the only rock of salvation.

I can only trust Him. I can only rely on Him. I grow stronger every day because I am not relying on this or that, or on someone else.  
No, I rely on Him—on Christ, my Savior. May the Lord give us this vision, give us this heart.  
May He make this a reality, not just a theory or words, but a true reality that comes through tribulations, through asceticism, and through overcoming ourselves.  
Through overthrowing the internal pharaoh, squeezing through the rocks like a snake shedding its old skin.  
We are squeezing through the hardships of this life, walking the narrow path so that our old self may be stripped away and destroyed.  
And we may emerge as victors and inheritors—or rather, as hearers—of the kingdom of heaven.  

May it be so. May the Lord give us strength, keep us on this path, guide us, grant us courage, and bring us spiritual recovery and vision.  
Despite the darkness and blindness that come from our flesh, from this world, and from the devil,  
may the Lord help us and make us victorious. Amen. God bless.
