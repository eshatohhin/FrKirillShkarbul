# How to gain peace a spritual paradox of Hesychasm

Dear brothers and sisters, I often speak about how this world is slipping into the laws of the Devil, and one of the reasons this happens is because we forget about the very important spiritual principle of silence. The Devil is depicted as a serpent, and the serpent whispers, attempting to lure us away. Its whispers aim to distract us from following Christ, from hearing God's voice, and from doing what is right. This is what led to the fall of the first humans, and it continues to bring about the chaos we see today.

This whisper is something we hear constantly, all day long. From morning to night, we are bombarded with noise—radio, advertisements, music, and endless content from apps like YouTube. We convince ourselves that we are saving time or learning, thinking, "Oh, I'm listening, I'm gaining so much knowledge." But in reality, the more we consume, the more we fill ourselves with unnecessary distractions. The true spiritual treasures within us fail to grow; instead, thorns of worldly noise choke the seeds of faith.

Today, I want to address this issue and share how we can manage it. First, we must recognize that we have this problem. One way to do this is by spending time in silence, perhaps in a forest or a quiet place. Many people, when they try this, find that even in external silence, there is an internal noise—thoughts, images, and distractions swirling within. This reveals that our hearts are not truly silent. Even when we attempt to pray, our minds are filled with clutter, making it difficult to focus on God.

Consider this: when we drive, we often turn on music because we cannot bear the silence. This is a form of addiction. We avoid stillness because we fear being alone with our thoughts and with God. Instead of seeking God in prayer, we crave entertainment. This, in essence, is what hell is like—a place filled with noise and devoid of God's presence. Even in moments of silence, like during camping trips, we feel the need to fill the void with music or chatter. If there is silence, we grow nervous, as if something is wrong. This constant need to fill the air with noise reflects the spiritual sickness we are in.

The advertisements we encounter, even on platforms like YouTube, are designed to distract us. They use flashy visuals, sound effects, and movement to capture our attention and divert us from what truly matters. This is the work of the Devil—distracting us, pulling us away from God.

Many saints found God in the stillness of nature—in forests, by the sea, or under the open sky. It was in these moments of quiet reflection that they felt God's presence and heard His voice. They discovered faith not in the hustle and bustle of daily life, but in the serenity of creation. Many saints withdrew from towns and villages, settling in forests or deserts to engage in spiritual warfare. They understood that our spiritual eyes and ears are often closed, and that the logic of spiritual life often contradicts worldly wisdom.

For example, we might think that a good night's sleep makes us ready to tackle the day, but spiritually, we may remain asleep. True spiritual awakening requires us to step away from the noise, to seek silence, and to listen for God's voice. Only then can we truly grow in faith and resist the distractions of the world.

Let us strive to reclaim the silence in our lives, to quiet the noise within and around us, and to open our hearts to God's presence. In doing so, we can resist the whispers of the Devil and draw closer to the divine.

And this is something that, for us, may not be immediately evident, but it is indeed what happens. This is why many saints prayed at night. Even the Lord Himself often prayed throughout the night. In Luke 6:12 and in Mark’s Gospel, we see that He rose early in the morning to pray. These were the times of silence, the moments when He communed with God. In monasteries today, monks follow a similar pattern—they sleep only a few hours, perhaps two or three, and then dedicate time to prayer. There is no luxury of eight or ten hours of sleep. Their lives are structured around spiritual discipline.

This principle extends to other areas of life as well. Take food, for example. We often think that eating abundantly will give us strength and energy to accomplish tasks, like building a house or working hard. But in reality, when we eat heavily, we often feel sluggish and want to rest or sleep. On the other hand, when we eat modestly and control our intake, we find ourselves more alert and energized. This is why fasting is a spiritual practice—it helps us maintain spiritual vigilance and focus on what truly matters.

Similarly, when we consume too much visual content—watching endless videos, playing games, or scrolling through images—our spiritual vision becomes clouded. We see so much that our spiritual eyes are blocked, and we fail to perceive the deeper truths. The same applies to hearing: when we constantly listen to music, lectures, or the radio, we drown out God’s voice. Even in speech, if we talk excessively, we become spiritually mute, unable to communicate meaningfully with God. This is a profound paradox: the more we engage physically, the less we are able to engage spiritually.

Of course, this does not mean we must abstain from all food, entertainment, or conversation unless we are monks or ascetics. St. Augustine wisely compared our spiritual life to a horse that needs to be tamed. We must learn to control our desires, knowing when to restrain and when to release. Without this discipline, our lives become chaotic, like a wild horse running uncontrollably. This lack of self-control is evident in the world today, where people are driven by their desires, much like the herd of swine that rushed into the sea and perished (Matthew 8:32). To be soldiers of Christ, we must exercise vigilance and self-control over our inner lives. When we pray, we must do so with sincerity and focus, truly speaking from the heart.

Many people today feel drawn to escape civilization, to retreat from the noise and distractions of modern life. Yet, in reality, most are drawn to cities, seeking higher salaries and more opportunities. However, the more we gain in this world, the less we may gain in the world to come. The more knowledge we accumulate about earthly matters, the less we may understand about God. It is often the simple, uneducated peasants who possess profound spiritual wisdom, even about earthly matters. This is not to dismiss education, but rather to emphasize the importance of filtering out what is unnecessary and focusing on what truly matters.

Let us now turn to the Gospel of Matthew, where Jesus speaks of the second coming. In Matthew 24:36-39, He describes the days of Noah, when people were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, oblivious to the impending flood. They were consumed by the distractions of their daily lives, unaware of the spiritual reality unfolding around them. This is a powerful reminder for us today. We must remain vigilant, not allowing the noise and distractions of this world to blind us to the coming of the Lord. Let us strive to live with spiritual discipline, keeping our hearts and minds focused on God, so that we may be ready when He returns.

"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be." (Matthew 24:36-39)

In these days, people will be preoccupied with their daily lives—marrying, building houses, sending rockets into space, creating hyperloops, and pursuing countless projects. Yet, suddenly, all of it will be gone, consumed by fire. The Bible tells us that when this happens, the earth and all its works will be burned away (2 Peter 3:10). These projects, these earthly endeavors, will vanish because they hold no eternal value in God's eyes. We must instead seek what truly matters to God—living according to His will. Sadly, so few people give this any thought.

Let us, therefore, strive to be wise and discerning. Let us cultivate silence in our hearts and practice the tradition of silent prayer, known as *hesychasm* in the Orthodox Church. In this stillness, our hearts can speak to God without the need for words. This is a powerful spiritual discipline, a way to protect ourselves from the noise and distractions of this world.

Let us reflect on this and seek to guard our hearts with this "vaccination" against the spirit of the world, which constantly tries to fill us with meaningless noise. May the Lord help us and bless us in this endeavor. Amen.
