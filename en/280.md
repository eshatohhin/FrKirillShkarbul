# St. Anastasiya Hendrikova - A Blessed Outspring of a Good Tree

One of Countess Anastasia Hendrikova's contemporaries wrote about her:  
"This fragile girl with a childish face, who seemed so weak, in fact had the soul of a heroine."  
Indeed, Countess Hendrikova's whole life was a Christian feat. Though she had to endure many sorrows, she always brought comfort to those around her. In her diaries, she once wrote about it thus:  
"The thought that the Emperor shared with me today sank deep into my mind: that the life experience the Lord has taken me through, I would use it to bring joy and comfort to others. Perhaps this is the task given to me by God."  

For about twenty years, beginning in her childhood, Anastasia Vasilyevna cared for her sick mother, Sofia Kirillovna, who was bedridden after a complex operation. Anastasia devoted all her free time to her, constantly trying to raise her spirits. She always kept in her heart the words spoken to her by Empress Saint Alexandra Feodorovna:  
"Be cheerful with her, and give her all the warmth of your love. Try to shine for her, despite the sufferings of your own or her soul."  

At a time when Anastasia's peers led the easy-going life of capital city aristocrats, she walked the narrow path of selfless ministry year after year. Many years of grief nurtured in her a living faith and strengthened her prayer. She led the simplest way of life, embodying modesty and strictly keeping her chastity.  

In 1910, she became a lady-in-waiting to Empress Alexandra. All members of the royal family fell in love with her for her open heart and kindness, affectionately calling her "Nastinka." In his memoirs, Captain Nikolai Sablin recalled how, during one trip on the yacht *Standart*, the Empress was deeply saddened by the illness of her only son, Prince Alexei. Countess Hendrikova did everything she could to console her. At that time, Saint Anastasia herself had just experienced a great sorrowâ€”the sudden death of her beloved father, Count Vasily Alexandrovich Hendrikov, from a heart attack. Despite her grief, Anastasia, as Nikolai Sablin wrote, "brought a stream of liveliness and cheerfulness into the lives of everyone around her."  

In the tragic days following the February Revolution, when the Emperor and his family were arrested and many courtiers hurried to abandon them, Countess Hendrikova, on the contrary, hurried back from Kislovodsk, where she had been visiting her sick sister. Despite the fact that her beloved sister, Alexandra, was gravely ill, Anastasia immediately set off on the return journey, having realized that the royal family needed her more. After being arrested together with them in Tsarskoye Selo, she wrote in her diary:  
"Thank God I managed to arrive in time so that I can be with them."  

Countess Hendrikova was a person of deep Christian faith. Faith was the foundation of her life and her family's. Thus, she followed the royal family on their Golgotha quite consciously for the sake of God's commandments. Knowing that death awaited her there, in her diary she wrote:  
"Filled with trust and love, I surrender myself entirely into the hands of God, and I know that the Lord will support me, both at the moment of death and at the time of temptations."  

The Commission for the Canonization of Saints of the Ekaterinburg Metropolitanate recently uncovered new information revealing the eminent piety of her ancestors. The most famous member of this noble clan was Anastasia's great-great-grandfather, Ivan Simonovich Hendrikov, a brave soldier who fought in the Russo-Turkish War. Ivan was a noble and sympathetic man distinguished by his deep Christian faith and pious church life. In his youth, a miraculous event occurred. During a battle, he happened to wear a small Iveron icon of the Most Holy Theotokos on his chest, and it saved his life from a deadly strike.

This miracle had a profound effect on Ivan Simonovich, and in memory of it, Count Hendrikov built a church in honor of the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God in his settlement in Kharkov Province. In addition to that church, Ivan built several others across the settlements that belonged to him. Undoubtedly, these constructions were encouraged by the ruling bishop at the time, Saint Joasaph of Belgorod, for whom Ivan had great reverence.  

Ivan Simonovich was beloved by many for his strong faith and kindness. Empress Catherine II, whom he served as a chamberlain, spoke of him thus:  
"In his presence, everyone felt at ease, for he never compromised anyone, nor showed disrespect to anyone. He was a man firm in conviction and of great honesty."  

The children and grandchildren of Count Hendrikov inherited from him a deep love for the Church. They built and decorated many churches and opened numerous almshouses in Kharkov Province. Anastasia Vasilyevna's great-grandmother wrote many holy icons for a church she had constructed with her own funds. Both her grandmother and her aunt were often honored with blessings from the Holy Synod for their abundant donations to churches. In total, the Hendrikovs built at least 11 churches. The documented evidence of these outstanding achievements has been recently discovered in the Russian State Historical Archives and Tsarist-era publications.  

Among Countess Anastasia's maternal ancestors were many who were distinguished by their outstanding piety. Countess Hendrikova grew up surrounded by vivid examples of living Christian faith, and throughout her life, she sought strength and motivation in God. Ultimately, her faith and love for Christ manifested with utmost radiance during times of tribulation.  

In 1917, before being exiled with the royal family to Tobolsk, she wrote in her diary:  
"I cannot leave this place without thanking God for the wonderful peace and strength He has sent me, and for His support during these five months of arrest. The more difficult and hard my life becomes, the greater is my inner peace. And now I realize that this is the best and the greatest happiness of all, and that with this feeling, one can endure anything, and I bless God. I have experienced upon myself that, as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."  

Countess Hendrikova's notes testify to the depth of her spiritual experience, filled with thoughts like this:  
"I see Thy chamber, my Savior, adorned. I do not yet have proper clothes to enter it. I still need to change many things in myself in order to enlighten the garment of my soul. But may the Lord Himself accomplish this, while I will accept from Him, with gratitude, all the trials that He has pleased to send upon me, firmly believing that through them the garment of my soul can receive the true light."  

From the Countess's diary, we learn that in Tobolsk, she regularly attended church and prayed with the royal family during all the services in their place of arrest.  

In May 1918, Countess Hendrikova followed the royal family to Yekaterinburg; however, she was not allowed into the Ipatiev House where they were held but was instead imprisoned in another house of arrest. In July, after the murder of the royal passion-bearers, the Countess was transferred to the Perm prison, located on the outskirts of the town. There, in the very prison cell where she was held with Princess Elena of Serbia, wife of Prince Ioann Konstantinovich Romanov, who was killed that same year by the Bolsheviks near Alapaevsk, Saint Anastasia continued to console her neighbors as before.  

Sometimes she even chanted to support and comfort Princess Elena, who was grieving over the fate of her husband. Sergei Smirnov, Princess Elena's secretary, recalled:  
"Nastinka, with her joyful smile, maintained the good spirits of Elena Petrovna, despite the hardship she had endured."

I always remember the charming smile of Anastasia Vasilyevna, her warm friendliness."  

Countess Hendrikova remained courageous to the end. On September 4, 1918, she was called to leave her prison cell, allegedly to be transported elsewhere. She understood, however, that she was being led to her death, yet she remained calm. Like the holy martyrs, she was not afraid of death. In her diary, she wrote:  
"If death awaits me, then how can it be frightening? I have much more there than here. I will finally be home in eternal bliss and peace."  

Countess Hendrikova was murdered outside the city, struck down by blows to the head with a rifle butt, which crushed her skull. Her body was thrown into a ditch, where it was later found by the Whites.  

Anastasia Hendrikova had lived on earth for only thirty years, but in that short time, she managed to bring joy and comfort to many people around her and gained for herself a crown in the kingdom of heaven, to which she had always aspired. As General Mikhail Dieterichs wrote:  
"Anastasia Vasilyevna was not afraid of death and was ready for it. She firmly believed in a bright afterlife and in the resurrection on the last day, and from this power of faith, she always drew vitality and peace of mind. We too believe that now she, along with the Holy Royal Family, stands before God and prays for us."
