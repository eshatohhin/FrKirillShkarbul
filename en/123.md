# Real threat, seducing the whole world.

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord wants us to be able to see what is happening on the spiritual level. He has given us both carnal, bodily eyes and spiritual eyes. However, we often keep our spiritual eyes closed and blind, which is why we are unable to fight against evil. We fail to understand where the danger is coming from, and as a result, we are hit hard by pandemics, crises, and many other challenges. Yet, we do not truly comprehend what is happening or where it will lead. This lack of understanding gives rise to fears that are not grounded in reality.

Different people have different fears—some fear racial issues, others ecological disasters. But the only real fear should be the fear of God. The true danger lies in the spiritual problems that humanity is facing. To fight in this spiritual war, we must analyze things spiritually. If you desire a spiritual life, you must examine the passions that dominate you. Identify what awakens your "old man"—the sinful nature—and allows it to control you. Pay attention to these things. This is why we practice fasting and observe Lent: to learn self-control and seek spiritual healing.

Similar dynamics are at play on a societal level. Humanity as a whole is increasingly influenced by certain forces, and these forces are driven by passions that exist on a global scale. Wars, revolutions, and all forms of human conflict arise because, on a mass cultural and social level, passions overwhelm many people simultaneously, leading to chaos and destruction.

The Church is often compared to a ship navigating through stormy waters filled with waves, thunder, and wind. Like the apostles in their boat, we must be aware of the direction of the wind and the conditions around us to prevent the ship from being overturned, damaged, or sunk. While we rely on the Lord, we cannot simply close our eyes and say, "Lord, take me there." Some may do this, but it is dangerous. If we fail to recognize spiritual dangers, we are likely to fall victim to them.

In the Gospel of Mark (7:20-23), the Lord tells us that evil intentions come from the human heart and defile a person. The same principle applies to society. Low passions are stirred up, take hold, and ultimately lead to destruction. History provides many examples of this. Revolutions that overthrew monarchs, plunged nations into bloodshed, and turned values upside down were not God's will. He allowed them to happen, but not because He desired suffering or death. These events were driven by jealousy, pride, vainglory, and other passions. People thought, "We don't have what they have. We are exploited. We don't want to obey; we want power for ourselves." These passions fueled massive movements that shattered social structures.

The Bolshevik Revolution is one such example. Similarly, the two World Wars resulted in the deaths of millions, a manifestation of dullness—a state where people feel nothing, kill without compassion, and lose their humanity. This, too, is a product of passions. Modern society has become desensitized, overwhelmed by too many stimuli, and unable to respond emotionally. On a societal level, this loss of empathy can lead to atrocities like concentration camps, where people are systematically killed.

In all these cases, the root cause is spiritual. To overcome these challenges, we must open our spiritual eyes, confront our passions, and seek God's guidance. Only then can we navigate the storms of this world and find true peace.

And, of course, there is the great will to power—the desire for domination and control. Almost all wars are driven by this craving. We also have the industrial revolutions, which brought both positive and negative changes. While they were often motivated by greed—the desire to produce more, consume more, and achieve greater efficiency—they were also fueled by laziness, as people sought machines to do their work for them. 

We cannot dismiss these developments as entirely bad, as they align with the Lord's commandment to subdue the earth and rule over it. However, passions such as greed and laziness often drive these advancements, leading to excess and imbalance. 

More recently, about 30 years ago, many countries underwent significant transformations: democratization, privatization, economic reforms, the rise of capitalism, globalization, and free trade. In the Soviet bloc, this was known as Perestroika. While these changes brought opportunities, they were also driven by greed. People wanted more—more possessions, more comfort, more freedom to indulge in material desires. They no longer wanted to live on a fixed salary of 120 rubles; they wanted to buy things, go on vacations, and stand out from others. Vainglory, egocentrism, and a love of comfort became pervasive. These passions contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and similar transformations worldwide. 

Now, we are approaching another major shift. The seeds of this revolution have already been sown, and we must consider its potential shape. We are living in times that echo the apocalyptic visions described in Scripture. No conspiracy theories are needed to see what is unfolding before our eyes. We must discern the driving forces behind these changes—the passions that are shaping our world. 

To understand the present, we must look back at least 50 years. The wave of change we are witnessing today has been building for decades, meticulously prepared step by step. Those behind these changes—instruments of the devil—rely not on direct control but on shaping trends. Even without coordination, the devil's influence works through these trends, guiding society toward his ends. 

Over the past 50 years, several key trends have emerged. First, there is the promotion of consumption: the relentless push to buy more, consume more, and seek greater comfort. This has made people, especially in the West, increasingly lazy and materialistic. Second, there is the "craving of the eyes"—the obsession with visual stimulation through movies, internet content, and social media. This has led to a decline in reading and critical thinking, as people passively consume endless streams of information and entertainment. 

Third, there is the rise of carnal perversion and lust, which have become pervasive in modern society. Lust is a significant problem today, defiling many and making spiritual warfare increasingly difficult. Together, these trends—consumption, comfort, and lust—pull people away from spiritual matters and ground them in materialism. This makes them easier to control, as they lose sight of fundamental truths and become disconnected from God. 

As we face this new revolution, we must recognize the spiritual battle at its core. The passions driving these changes—greed, laziness, lust, and the desire for power—are tools of the enemy. To resist, we must open our spiritual eyes, reject these temptations, and seek God's guidance. Only by turning to Him can we navigate these turbulent times and find true peace.

You are more grounded in the immediate, the superficial, and the material. You are hooked, cracked, and hacked—ensnared by the distractions and temptations of this world. This creates fertile ground for ideologies like communism, where individual beliefs are discarded in favor of collective unity. It paves the way for a one-world religion, New Age spirituality, and practices like yoga, naturalism, and veganism, which often replace the worship of God with the worship of creation itself. People elevate mother nature above the Creator, losing sight of the divine. 

At the same time, we face a growing crisis of drugs, depression, and social isolation. While these issues destroy lives, they are not the primary drivers of the coming revolution. Instead, they serve to weaken and distract individuals, making them more susceptible to manipulation. Depression, loneliness, and addiction are tools that remove people from the equation, leaving them broken and disengaged. 

All these passions—greed, lust, laziness, and the craving for novelty—work together to produce a common effect. They shape a society that is increasingly detached from reality, morality, and truth. We can already see the outlines of the coming revolution. Scripture warns us that people will live in an alternate reality, one where the Antichrist will deceive them with visions and illusions. Those who are not part of this system will recognize it as false, but for many, it will become their entire world. 

This virtual reality will feel more real to them than the physical world. They will reject God, despise morality, and embrace the Antichrist's promises of material comfort and pleasure. We can see the seeds of this future taking root today. Perhaps it will fully manifest in 50, 100, or even 500 years, but the trajectory is clear. The real danger is not technological control through chips or electronics but the passions and desires that drive people to willingly surrender their freedom and humanity. 

The revolution of tomorrow will differ from past upheavals like the Soviet Revolution. It will not be driven by a desire for money or possessions. Instead, it will be fueled by the craving for virtual experiences, novelty, and instant gratification. People immersed in computer games, TikTok, and other digital platforms are not primarily motivated by material needs. While gluttony and greed still exist, they are no longer the dominant forces. 

The driving passions of this new revolution will be the craving of the eyes—the insatiable desire to see more, experience more, and consume endless streams of digital content. Laziness will also play a central role, as people shirk responsibility and seek to escape into virtual worlds. They will prioritize entertainment over work, seeking easy money through likes, monetization, and internet fame. 

We can already see the prototype of this revolution in the behavior of bloggers, TikTokers, and social media influencers. They spend countless hours creating content, chasing vanity, and seeking validation from strangers. This lifestyle is irrational and psychologically damaging, yet it is becoming increasingly normalized. People are growing more irrational, more susceptible to manipulation, and more disconnected from reality. 

This is the shape of the revolution to come—a society driven by virtual desires, laziness, and vanity, where truth and morality are discarded in favor of fleeting pleasures and digital illusions. As Christians, we must recognize these trends, resist the temptations of this world, and remain grounded in the truth of God's Word. Only by staying vigilant and spiritually awake can we navigate these turbulent times and remain faithful to our calling.

If you spend even an hour immersed in these digital platforms, you might feel as though you're developing a psychological disorder. The constant need for novelty, the rapid switching from one thing to another, and the addictive pull of endless content leave you craving more. This is the image of the revolutionary of tomorrow—a person hooked on the instant gratification of virtual experiences, constantly seeking the next thrill, the next trend, the next distraction. 

When a trend emerges, everyone jumps on board, competing to see who can do it better. This creates a collective mindset, but it is not a unity in Christ. Instead, it is a unity in temptation, sin, and delusion. This shared mindset will fuel future revolutions, driven by individuals like the angry blogger or TikToker who reject traditional ways of life. They demand basic income, freedom from responsibility, and a life free from the burdens of family or meaningful human connection. Communication becomes limited to chats, emojis, and superficial interactions, while reading and deep thinking are abandoned in favor of intuitive, instant responses. 

All these passions—laziness, lack of responsibility, selfishness, and vainglory—are leading humanity into a new world, a metaverse where reality is increasingly virtual. Soon, technology will allow us to not only see and hear but also feel and smell within these digital realms. Devices will control our brain impulses, dictating our emotions and reactions. Artificial intelligence will teach, guide, and control us, shaping this new world of tomorrow. 

We are on the brink of this revolution, and the driving forces behind it are not the devices themselves but the passions that make people willing to embrace this virtual existence. The real danger lies in the growing number of individuals who are eager to abandon reality for this new world. As Christians, we will become a minority, standing firm in our faith while the world around us succumbs to temptation and delusion. 

The world is preparing everyone for this shift, pushing them toward a life disconnected from truth, morality, and God. We must guard ourselves against this evil. In our morning prayers, we ask the Lord to save us from the evil of the day. Through fasting and spiritual discipline, we seek autonomy from our passions and the fallen desires of this world. We strive to listen to God rather than the siren call of materialism and virtual escapism. 

May the Lord grant us wisdom and strength to resist these temptations and remain faithful to Him. Let us be vigilant, rooted in Christ, and steadfast in our commitment to truth. Only by staying spiritually awake can we navigate the challenges of this world and remain safe from the evil that seeks to ensnare us.
