# What happened with Sredneuralsk Monastery.

Dear brothers and sisters, last year I recorded a couple of videos regarding the monastery in the Ural region near Yekaterinburg, the Monastery of Srednyi Ural, because there was a lot of controversy surrounding this monastery's leader, Nikolai Romanov. He used to be the father of Sergei, but he was defrauded and then excommunicated from the church last year. He was imprisoned in December and remains in prison to this day. Recently, the entire monastery was evacuated; all the nuns—numbering a couple hundred—were forcibly removed from the premises by the police. This incident, along with other issues concerning religious freedom in Russia and elsewhere, compels me to speak a few words about the situation and how we, as Orthodox Christians, should view it.

If we remain silent, we implicitly condone what is happening, and worse outcomes may follow. The Lord's blessing may even depart from us and from the Church if the majority silently acquiesce to such events. What has transpired is a disgrace. No government should impose such measures on its people. Regardless of the perceived danger—even if the individuals in question were terrorists, which they were not—they were nuns devoted to prayer. One may agree or disagree with their beliefs, but treating people in this manner—forcibly removing elderly nuns and casting them onto the streets—is unacceptable. I, for one, strongly disapprove of such actions, and I believe it is important for everyone to form an opinion on this matter. Otherwise, we become complicit in what has occurred.

This raises an important question for us: Where do we draw the line? Where does religious freedom, which respects individuals' choices, end, and where does the tolerance of destructive sects or terrorist groups that masquerade as religious bodies begin? The government justifies its actions by citing national security. However, we must remember that all persecutions in the Roman Empire and the Soviet Union were also carried out under the guise of national security. Today, the situation is no different, except that official Orthodox churches are not persecuted in most countries—except perhaps in some Muslim or Communist nations, which are few in number.

We must find this boundary. Of course, the government will never fully disclose its reasoning for persecuting a religious group, as any government seeks to maintain control over all aspects of life. Religion, however, is one area where the government has the least control. Truly religious individuals hold values that transcend governmental authority and even the law. They may follow leaders who advocate ideas contrary to the law. Modern governments, in their quest for control, even seek to manipulate and brainwash people. Some governments aim to eradicate religion entirely.

We have spoken before about the devil's plan to destroy all forms of religion, leaving only what can be termed "Mammonism"—the worship of Mammon, or wealth, and all that it entails. This false religion, though it may adopt various names, will ultimately unite its followers under a single, counterfeit, anti-Christian belief system. We are aware of this goal, and while we cannot control the government, we must, at the very least, form an opinion when issues arise within the Orthodox world—whether in an Orthodox country or involving a former Orthodox monastery. If people ask us, we must respond, for we bear collective responsibility for everything that happens to the Orthodox Church worldwide.
