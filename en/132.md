# Short visit to Trinidad

Dear brothers and sisters, the mission trip to Sri Lanka has ended. The church there is developing, and there is much success. In one of the videos soon, I will share with you about the situation there.  
Now, I am embarking on another mission trip. The Lord has blessed the mission to Dominica. It is a short trip, about 7 to 8 days, and I will also make some videos from Dominica.  
This is a very rare opportunity because, usually, I am in Taiwan and cannot travel anywhere due to quarantine requirements. When I return to Taiwan, I must undergo a 14-day quarantine, so I cannot leave the church for so long.  
That is why it is the Lord's blessing that, during this trip, since I am already out of Taiwan, I can also visit some other places. When I was told that there is an urgent need for a priest to visit Dominica, I agreed to go there to develop the mission.  
There are some missionaries there—two already—but no priests. They need a priest to support them and to further develop the mission, as they have come there to build the church.  
There are very few faithful, and they are ready to build the church, but there are almost no people who would attend it. Therefore, there is a need for me to go and try to expand the mission.  
So, please pray for this trip. I am leaving in a couple of hours. Right now, I am transiting in Trinidad and Tobago. Behind me, you can see the mountains—a small mountain range that spans across the northern border of the island.  
Since I am here, I will share a little about this place, the mission, the spiritual situation here, and some of my recent thoughts about the mission—what can be done, what each of us should do, especially as we approach the great events to come.  

Trinidad and Tobago is somewhat similar to East Timor in terms of population—over a million people—and the size and density of the island.  
There are many Catholics here, though not as many as in Timor. About 20-25% of the population is Catholic, and the country is predominantly Christian, with about 55% identifying as Christian.  
It is also an oil-producing country, but the people do not benefit from this oil. The government is quite corrupt, and while there are very rich individuals and multinational corporations expanding here, the majority of people are quite poor.  
There is a lot of poverty and crime, and the situation is not very good, despite the proximity of the United States and its assistance. Unlike East Timor, which is secluded, Trinidad and Tobago is close to many resources, yet it remains very poor.  
Compared to places like Guam, it is much poorer, but this poverty and the sorrows people experience here bring them closer to Christ.  

Recently, I visited the United States, a rich country, but the spirit there is very different. It is much more difficult to find Christ in such a setting.  
I believe the spirit of the Antichrist is stronger there than here, and this creates excellent opportunities for mission work. Mission is where Christ is needed, where people have hearts open to Him.  
During my 8-hour transit here, I visited the city of Port of Spain. I spoke with a taxi driver named Douglas, a very nice older man who shared with me about his life, his family, and life in Trinidad and Tobago.  
He is from Tobago, a small island not far from here, which is also very beautiful.  
The nature here is stunning, and the people are kind—perhaps more provincial and less spoiled by civilization. They are very open due to the multicultural setting, with people of Indian, Afro-Trinidadian, Métis, and European descent living together.

People from South America, Venezuela, and everywhere else have settled here. There is religious freedom, with many different kinds of religions, and people are very open-minded and searching for truth.  
I can feel that. This place needs a mission—it truly needs one. I gave our brochure to Douglas, the taxi driver, and an icon to the person selling coffee, but of course, this is just a small gesture.  
It is good that an Orthodox priest is coming here regularly. There are already a few Orthodox believers here, though not many. Still, the presence of a priest is a positive sign.  
Trinidad does not need my visit as urgently as other places, which is why I am heading to Dominica instead. However, these short visits and services here are almost insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  
To develop the mission here, we need people to stay long-term. We need to build trust. The small-island culture carries a sense of superiority, as if they already know everything.  
There is a pride here, a belief that foreigners have little to teach them. To bring the Word of God, the Gospel, and the Orthodox faith, we need a long-term strategy—a team of people, not just one individual.  
This work must span decades, not just a few years, to build trust and open hearts to the message of Christ.  

You see, I went to Sri Lanka, and even there, not much mission work has been done. For 2,000 years, we could not establish a mission in Sri Lanka. The first Orthodox baptism there took place just two weeks ago, despite its proximity to other Christian regions.  
This has led me to some conclusions. We are now concerned about the coming of the Antichrist, church divisions, quarrels among patriarchs, and the changing world described in apocalyptic visions.  
But in focusing on these things, we are losing time. We are preoccupied with what will happen tomorrow, how it relates to the Revelation of St. John, and how the world is transforming into what some call a "digital concentration camp."  
Yet, the Lord expects each of us to act, to contribute something meaningful. I will elaborate on this later, but please reflect on it.  

As we approach the great events to come, let us consider what each of us can do—both in terms of our spiritual growth and our contribution to the mission.  
We must strive to be spiritually healthy, to draw closer to Christ, and to contribute to the Church, our families, and the Christian upbringing of our children. We must pray together as families and teach our children the Christian faith.  
We must focus on strengthening our faith, helping others, and shedding our old, selfish selves. The Lord will judge us not by how much we know about the Antichrist or church politics, but by the fruits of our faith and actions.  

If our lives end tomorrow, in a year, or in fifty years, these fruits are what the Lord will ask of us. Let us focus on what we can bring to Him.  
What fruits can we bear? What can our faith accomplish? Here, I see everyone busy with something, but few are engaged in mission work. No one goes to Sri Lanka. The mission field is rich, yet everyone is preoccupied with other concerns.

Please think about this. Please pray for the mission and reflect on what you can do for the Lord. May the Lord help you and bless you. Amen.
