# True Gnosis of God in the Information Age

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen.  
In the forty days after His resurrection, the Lord came to His disciples—and to us—revealing the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven.  
What are these secrets?  
Today, let us reflect more deeply on what it means to know God, how we are distracted, and how we can come to know God in this age of information overload that we live in.  

We know that in the early days of the Church, there were people known as Gnostics.  
These individuals were essentially Satanists, people who rejected the truth and served another master—the devil.  
They criticized the "evil God," as they called our God, and because of them, the concept of Gnosis became tainted and devalued.  
However, in the early Church, figures like Saint Clement of Alexandria taught that a Christian must become a true Gnostic.  
What did he mean by this?  
He meant that we must receive true Gnosis.  
What is this Gnosis?  

The early ascetics of the 1st and 2nd centuries began each day before sunrise with earnest prayer.  
What were they asking for?  
They prayed for a "fine day" or a "perfect day."  
What does this mean?  
Not good weather, no. In fact, to this day, we still include in our Liturgy the petition: "Grant us, O Lord, a perfect, holy, sinless, and peaceful day."  
What is a "perfect day"?  
It is a day in which the Lord opens our minds to receive His truth.  
If you receive the truth on that day, it is a fine day for you.  
Let us reflect on this.  

Our inner eyes, our spiritual eyes, must be opened, and our lives must be pleasing to the Lord so that He may reveal His truth to us today.  
But often, we think, "Okay, I just need to know what is right. Orthodoxy is right, so I believe in Orthodoxy."  
Or, "Sola Scriptura—only the Bible. I have the Bible, I read it, and I understand it. I’m fine; I’ll keep living as I always have."  
We become immersed in our agendas and the flood of information around us.  
We spend our days glued to our gadgets, scrolling through news, Facebook, and other distractions.  
And in doing so, we miss something of utmost importance.  
This is what I want to discuss today.  

Let us consider what the Lord Himself said.  
In John 10:14, He declares, "I am the good shepherd; I know my own, and my own know me."  
The people of God know God. This refers to kenosis, the knowledge of God.  
Further, in John 10:27, He says, "My sheep hear my voice."  
Those who follow Christ hear His voice and distinguish it from the voices of strangers.  
In Matthew 11:27, we read, "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."  
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is willing to reveal the Father to those He chooses.  
Without this revelation, we can know nothing about God.  

This knowledge must be daily. We must receive it continually.  
If we stop, we are lost. It is not enough to say, "I’ve got it; I’m baptized; I’m fine; now I can move on."  
No, we must remain in this knowledge.  
In our prayers after Holy Communion, we say, "Lord, preserve us in Your holiness, that all the day we may meditate on Your righteousness, on Your truth."  
We need the Body of Christ. We receive Holy Communion and ask Him to preserve us in His holiness so that, throughout the day, we may learn His righteousness.  
Sometimes this is translated as "meditate on Your righteousness."  
To meditate is to receive, to know, to learn, and to discover.

We need to pray about this earnestly.  
Saint Basil the Great teaches us that knowing God is manifested through keeping His commandments.  
If we love the commandments of Christ—what He has taught us—it means we love Christ Himself.  
As He said, "Whoever loves me will keep my commandments" (John 14:15).  
The saints, such as Saint Clement of Alexandria and many others, emphasized that asceticism is the path to knowing God.  
It is not merely about learning theology or reading many books to gain knowledge about God.  
Books are valuable, but without asceticism, they are of no use.  
Similarly, asceticism without knowing God is incomplete.  
Some may think, "I need to fast, I need to do this or that," but neglect to seek a deeper understanding of God.  
This, too, is a mistake.  
You will come to know God more fully through an ascetic life.  

What is an ascetic life?  
It is the mortification of the self and the cultivation of the new creation within you.  
It is the struggle to overcome passions, which is especially challenging in this age of information overload.  
The Lord Himself said, "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things"—referring to earthly concerns like food, drink, and clothing—"will be added to you" (Matthew 6:33).  
Do we truly seek the Lord and His truth every day, or are we consumed by our gadgets, constantly distracted by news, social media, and other trivialities?  

The Apostle Paul warns us in Romans 3:11, "There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away; they have together become worthless."  
These are sobering words.  
If we do not know God, if we divert ourselves from His path of truth and righteousness through sin or by immersing ourselves in the distractions of this world, we become useless.  
We ask why so many people die in wars, from viruses, or from diseases like cancer.  
The truth is, when we are disconnected from God, our existence loses its purpose in His eyes.  
This is why we perish so easily, like mosquitoes.  

It is crucial for us to understand that our belongingness to the kingdom of God is our true reality.  
This is our fortress, our everything.  
The external world is out there, and while we have some responsibility toward it, we must remember that we are in the world but not of it (John 17:16).  
When we need to engage with the world, we should do so with discernment, always returning to our spiritual foundation.  
If we immerse ourselves in the world without returning to Christ, we risk losing Him entirely.  

This is why we, and those around us, are often filled with complaints.  
Life feels hard; we struggle with relationships, jobs, the economy, and politics.  
But these struggles arise because we have allowed the world to define our reality.  
This is not our true world.  
Our reality is rooted in Christ, in the peace and joy He provides.  
Our internal world, shaped by our relationship with Him, should determine our outlook, not the chaos and distractions of the external world.  

Let us strive to live in this truth, seeking God daily through prayer, asceticism, and obedience to His commandments.  
Only then can we find true peace and purpose, unshaken by the trials of this world.

Materialists, such as Marxists and others, claim that reality determines consciousness.  
They argue that your profession, wealth, nationality, education, family, career, and other external factors define who you are.  
They believe you are a product of the world and its circumstances.  
But for us, as Christians, this is not the case.  
We must break free from this worldly determination.  
It is our love for Christ that defines who we are.  
This love grants us spiritual freedom, joy, and the power of the resurrection working within us.  
This is what truly determines our identity, not the external conditions of our lives.  

We should not allow our existence to be limited or defined by material circumstances.  
The spiritual reality within us, born of our knowledge of the Lord, is what shapes who we are.  
We are aware of what is happening in the world.  
Since 2020, the world has been undergoing a dramatic restructuring.  
We have been struck repeatedly, and though there may be moments of respite, we must not relax.  
The next challenge is already on the horizon, and those who seek to build a new world order will not stop.  

This is not a time for complacency.  
It is a time for us to grow spiritually stronger, to prepare ourselves for what is to come.  
Greater trials are ahead, and if we do not fortify our souls in Christ and His truth, we will not endure.  
Let us use this time to become stronger soldiers of Christ, avoiding laziness, despondency, and worldliness.  
Now is the time to draw strength from the Lord, to seek His revelations, and to stand firm in His truth.  

During this season, especially in the time of Pascha, the Lord is revealing much to us.  
Let us ask Him to preserve us in His truth, to make us holy, and to strengthen us so that we may face whatever challenges come our way for His glory.  
May the Lord grant us the strength, joy, and perseverance to remain steadfast in His truth.  

Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!
