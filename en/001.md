# Orthodox Christian Missionary Channel - Welcome and self-intro.

Dear friends, I'm Father Kirill, and welcome to our new video channel.  
First of all, let me introduce to you who we are, what we do, and what we're going to talk about.  
Just before we do that, I want to let you know that this project began as an outcome of the pandemic. Any bad thing can bring about some good results. People cannot come to the church, so the priests and missionaries need to reach out and bring the word of God to everyone.  
This channel is created for anyone who can listen and understand English, no matter whether you believe in Christ or not, whether you're Orthodox or not. You're welcome to come over, and you'll find some relevant, interesting stuff here.  

So, first of all, who are we? This is a Russian Orthodox mission in Taiwan. Right now, I'm located in the Orthodox parish of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Taipei, Taiwan. This is where we do mission work in Taiwan and also in other nearby countries, such as the Philippines, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and other places. Now, through the internet, we can do mission work anywhere, and we hope that these videos can reach the United States, Canada, Latin America, Africa, and all those places.  

Okay, so why and what are we going to talk about? The goal of this channel is to awaken faith for those who already believe in Christ, to bring the Orthodox perspective on many issues, to answer some difficult questions, and to provide a missionary channel that is not loaded with difficult theology but is applied to everyone's lives.  
We're going to talk about issues in personal life, issues in social life, and events that happen in the world, and to see how they are related to the Gospel. How does the Gospel apply to these things? For example, many people are talking about the apocalypse and Revelation right now. We're going to talk about those things as well.  

For those who are not Christian, the main task is to get you interested so that you can see that in Christ and through Christ, we can find answers to many questions. You will be able to reconsider your life, your worldview, and many things will become clearer. We will share our faith and invite other speakers to discuss various issues related to science, different countries, cultural topics, and all of that will be here on this channel.  

For those who already believe in Christ, here we will discuss what spiritual life is, what it takes to reach salvation, and things like this, which are of great interest but not many people think about or know about. We will talk about how to receive messages from God, how to discern these messages, and how to change ourselves so that we can follow what God wants us to do. What is God's will, and how do we follow it?  

I really hope that what we talk about will be very practical, very relevant, and that you will enjoy it. So, you are very welcome to come over and see. I will announce our first video, which is coming soon. It is going to be about why the devil is portrayed as a snake, why it's not a pig, why it's not a dog, why it's a snake in the Bible, and how it is related to our lives and how the devil relates to our lives.  

This will be the first topic because all of us are warriors of Christ, and we need to learn how to defeat the devil both inside us and in this world.  
May God bless every one of you, and I will see you very soon. God bless.
