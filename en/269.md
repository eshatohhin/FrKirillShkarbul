# How Dormition of Theotokos Reveals the Meaning of Salvation

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church is celebrating the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos. This is a very joyful feast. But if we think about it, we might wonder why the death of a saint is a celebration. Why do we celebrate the end of life? It should be a sorrowful event. Well, this is carnal logic. To penetrate any truth of faith, we must receive spiritual revelation. You remember when the Apostle Peter answered the Lord's question, "Who do you say that I am?" He said, "You are the Messiah, the anointed one, the Son of the living God." And the Lord replied, "It is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven." So whenever we want to have a true understanding, it is not enough just to use our brain and our logic to arrive at some conclusions, as is very common in scholasticism. But in true Christianity, we need revelation from the Holy Spirit to comprehend such things.

Before I talk about the Dormition itself, I want to emphasize that before this feast, we had a two-week fast, the Dormition Fast. We have four major fasts in the Church, not counting the one-day fasts every Wednesday and Friday. The Dormition Fast is the shortest, lasting only two weeks. This fast is dedicated entirely to the Mother of God. During this fast, the goal is to penetrate deeper into the mystery of the Mother of God. Understanding this mystery brings us to the understanding of the Incarnation, of the Lord's coming into this world. If we do not understand Mother Mary, we do not understand Jesus Christ. Like the Protestants, they do not understand, and thus they do not grasp the Incarnation, which is why it is a heresy. But we need to delve deeply into this mystery.

This brings us to several very important points. One of them is that the Most Holy Theotokos became the second Eve. The first Eve was the one who gave life. All humans were born from Eve in terms of receiving their life. Of course, life is given by God, but the role of a mother is very important. This is why, in Hebrew, Eve means "life." Adam called her "life," saying, "You are life." He had this understanding, this ability to see and penetrate the essence of what he saw. "Oh, you are life," he said when he saw Eve. So she became the mother of all humanity, of all subsequent generations. But the first forefathers, Adam and Eve, fell and were chased away from the Garden of Eden. They were awaiting salvation. Salvation came in Jesus Christ, who became the second Adam. He restored the first Adam and gave salvation and true union with God to every human who receives Him and follows Him. And His mother, the Ever-Virgin Mary, became the second Eve because she gave birth to Jesus. She participated in this mystery. This is why the Apostle Luke gives us a detailed account of how this happened.

This is very important, and some heretics have very blasphemous ideas. They say, "Oh, she just provided flesh, so God had to come and take this flesh from somewhere. Okay, so He used her flesh, became flesh, became human, and that's it. You are just a piece of flesh that I used." This is blasphemy. The spiritual relationship between mother and son, even in any family, in any mother-son relationship, is a very deep relationship. It is not just about taking flesh from someone. It is a very deep spiritual relationship. The Lord was born of her, and she became the only person on earth who can call Him "my Son." No one else can say that. He is our Lord, but He is not our son. We are His children, striving to become His children.

So this is why He also has a very deep filial love, obedience, respect, and reverence. "Honor your father and your mother," as the commandment says. He has this filial love and respect toward His mother, and He does not have it toward anyone else on earth. This deep mystery brings us to an appreciation of who the Mother of God is and why she was chosen to become such a person—because of her pure life, her pure heart, and how she fearlessly followed Him despite all the humiliation she had to endure, despite the pain she was promised to bear as the mother of the Messiah. She endured that pain greatly when He was betrayed and crucified. 

Moreover, everyone thought He was illegitimate. When they said, "He is the carpenter, the son of Mary," it was a great insult and rudeness. In that culture, to refer to someone as the son of their mother rather than their father implied that they had no father, that they were a bastard. So both Jesus and Mary lived with this humiliation and injustice throughout their lives. Yet, despite all this, she had such great love for everyone and for her Son. She cared deeply for people, as we see at the wedding in Cana, where she was concerned about their lack of wine. We could speak at length about this, but today I also want to focus on the Dormition and how it relates to our own lives.

For the Mother of God, her Dormition was not just the end of her life but the completion of it—the final result, the goal of all her life. She gained the reward, if you will, the crown of glory given to the righteous. The Lord Himself came to take her soul into heaven, and she gained new life. In this new life, she dedicates herself to prayer on behalf of all of us—all who love Jesus and desire to follow Him. This is why we call it the Dormition, not death. It is a falling asleep in this life, awaiting the resurrection at the Second Coming of Christ. During this time, she lives with all the righteous in heaven, in prayer and communion with the entire Church, both in heaven and on earth.

This is why, for us, this is a great joy and consolation. If we dedicate ourselves to the path of salvation—the narrow path, which is so hard to find—we too can hope for such a reward. The Lord Himself said in the Gospel of Matthew that few find this narrow path and follow it, while many walk the broad path to destruction, to Abaddon, the deepest part of hell. We do not want to walk toward Abaddon; we want to follow the narrow path, no matter how difficult it may be. We must remain loyal to Christ, fighting against all evil, sin, passion, blindness, and the filthiness and corruption of this world. 

We have this great consolation: if we remain faithful, we will gain repose, a blessed rest, and a reward from our Lord. We will be embraced by Him, taken by the angels to His bosom, and united with the Church in heaven and on earth in eternal joy. So, brothers and sisters, let us be thankful to the Lord for placing us on this path. Let us be completely dedicated to it, no matter the challenges we face. Let us have the decisiveness to persevere through any trial, knowing that our reward is with Him.

This feast of the Dormition does not mean that we are hoping to die soon—by no means! Rather, we are hoping to walk this path faithfully and to accomplish the mission given to us by the Lord in this life. No matter how great this mission is, no matter how many years or challenges lie ahead, we are willing and hopeful that we can fulfill it and, at the end, receive the blessed reward together with all the saints in His kingdom. 

May the Lord strengthen us on this path. May the Mother of God pray for us, help us, strengthen our faith, and protect us from every evil, from every impure and unholy thought, and from slipping into any sin or passion. May He sanctify us and make us victorious on this path. Amen. 

A blessed Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos to you, brothers and sisters. Amen.
