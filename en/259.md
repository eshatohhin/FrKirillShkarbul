# Spiritual Freedom in Christ vs. Pseudo-liberty of a Liberal.

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
I haven't recorded any videos for a while because I was on a mission trip to Russia to address some church matters and to initiate a mission project focused on internal mission work within Russia.  

Some people ask me how an Orthodox country could need a missionary from Taiwan to develop mission work within Russia. While this might sound unusual, it is, in fact, true. The number of priests in Russia is so limited that even Orthodox churchgoers sometimes do not receive enough attention or care from the priests, let alone those outside the church. Today, the majority of the population—perhaps around 98%—does not attend church. Even those who do attend often lack understanding of why they are there. Additionally, the missionary zeal among priests in Russia is not very strong. Of course, there are missionary priests, but they are few in number.  

In fact, there are fewer priests in Russia than train drivers—a profession that is already not very common. Becoming a priest is not a popular career choice, and the number of priests is quite low. While mission work should not be limited to priests and should involve laypeople as well, there is a general lack of mission initiatives. One such initiative was proposed, and I decided to move forward with organizing and supporting this mission project. It has been quite successful, and I am hopeful that it will continue to bear fruit.  

One of the reasons Russian society is drifting further away from the church is the lingering materialism from the Soviet era, combined with modern consumerism and the digital brainwashing that is reshaping people's minds, especially among the younger generation. This generation is increasingly disconnected from tradition, history, the church, and often even from moral values. There is a significant generational gap between the youth and the church, and there is a pressing need to bridge this divide.  

Given these challenges, I found it necessary and worthwhile to go to Russia and help initiate this project. However, today I want to discuss a related topic: freedom. This word is frequently used in political rhetoric, cultural discussions, and everywhere else—freedom, liberation, human rights. It is also a central theme in the church. The Apostle Paul tells us that we are free, that the truth has set us free, and that even a slave can be spiritually free, while a free person can be spiritually enslaved.  

The freedom often discussed in society frequently contradicts the freedom given to us by God. Today, I want to provide an overview of what we mean by true freedom. Let us recall the parable of the prodigal son.

The prodigal son sought freedom—freedom from family, tradition, and his father. He desired economic independence, so he took his rightful inheritance and left for another country. He embraced a cosmopolitan lifestyle, believing that anywhere could be his home as long as he had money. This pursuit of personal freedom led him down a destructive path.  

Two significant things happened to him. First, he fell into moral corruption, living a life of debauchery, indulging in adultery and fornication. Second, he squandered all his wealth and found himself in economic and political slavery. He was forced to offer himself as a servant—essentially a slave—to one of the rulers of that land, who symbolizes the devil. This ruler, a tyrant, treated him harshly, reducing him to a state of misery where he even ate with pigs. In every way, the prodigal son was enslaved—morally by his passions and carnal desires, and politically by the oppressive ruler.  

This story reflects a broader pattern in human history. Since the Renaissance, humanity has pursued political emancipation, striving to be free from tyranny, monarchy, and hierarchy. We have witnessed revolutions—capitalist, industrial, cultural, and sexual—each promising liberation. The political revolutions, for instance, seemed to grant human rights and democracy, allowing people to vote and participate in governance. However, through propaganda and manipulation, these systems often result in the total control of the masses. Democracy becomes a tool for manipulation, and individual rights lead to egoism, where people see themselves as the center of decision-making.  

This shift stems from the Reformation and reflects a broader trend of anthropolatry—the worship of man. We have moved from a God-centered worldview to a man-centered one, where human desires and autonomy are prioritized above all else. This pursuit of freedom, divorced from divine truth, often leads to moral and spiritual enslavement, just as it did for the prodigal son.

This man-centered world, where man becomes the measure of all things, leads societies to atomization and disintegration. Constitutions, rather than unifying, become platforms for endless debates and quarrels. There are two primary outcomes of this trajectory—not solutions, but inevitable results.  

The first outcome is total war, where everyone fights for their own interests, leading to chaos and conflict. The second outcome is the rise of a "leviathan"—a massive government or system that absorbs everyone into its mechanism. This system can be imposed externally or achieved through brainwashing, but its effect is the same: individuals lose their autonomy and become mere cogs in a vast machine. This is a direct consequence of the individualization and egoism of a self-centered world, where traditions, values, and cultures are destroyed, leaving only hollow decorations. The result is political slavery, where true freedom is lost.  

This process also leads to the commercialization of everything. Money becomes the highest value, and everything is reduced to a commodity that can be bought and sold. Even former ideals of honor, righteousness, and heroism are replaced by the cold logic of trade and finance. Knights of old, who once embodied virtue and courage, now become traders or bankers, willing to sell anything for profit. While this is a troubling development, it is not the worst outcome.  

The worst outcome is the emancipation from humanity itself. This is the next step, a dream once envisioned by Marx and socialists, now becoming a reality. In this scenario, people no longer want to be human. They reject being defined by their gender, ethics, moral norms, or even their intellect. They seek to transcend humanity, merging with machines, controlling their genes, and dictating their own evolution. However, this control is an illusion. In reality, individuals are told what to do—whether it is vaccination or other mandates—and are forced into a "brave new world" they did not choose.  

This transhumanist, inhuman project has a sinister goal: to strip humanity of its divine image. Humans, blinded by pride in their abilities, lose control of their identity and personality. When the image of God within them is erased, they are left with the image of a beast—driven by base passions and the dark powers of a fallen nature. For example, in video games, players lose themselves in virtual worlds, consumed by the logic of the game, whether gaining treasures or committing virtual violence. This immersion in virtuality is a precursor to a broader trend of digitalization and virtualization, where people increasingly lose touch with reality.  

Eventually, such individuals cease to be persons. They become mere agents or elements of a system—spiritually empty and devoid of true identity. Many people already fit this description, and their numbers will grow. This is the tragic outcome of so-called freedom and emancipation. These individuals will be merged into one vast scheme, forming the kingdom of the Antichrist. They will share one mind and one body, but it will not be the body of Christ—it will be the body of the Antichrist. This is the new Babylon, a dystopian reality born from the rejection of divine truth and the pursuit of false freedom.

This is the big picture, and I hope it is now clearer to you how far this is from Christian freedom—the freedom we gain in Christ. This is freedom from passions, illusions, and determinism. Though we live in this world, we are not bound by it. As Christians, we are called to be spiritually alienated from this world, not conforming to its ways. True Christian freedom is not about egoism but about ministry, self-sacrifice for the good of others, and seeking life in Christ rather than the fleeting, fake pleasures offered by this fallen world of delusion.  

The freedom given by grace is not rooted in money, political rights, or self-centered pursuits. It is a spiritual freedom that stands in stark contrast to the egoistic, liberal emancipation promoted by the world. The latter leads individuals to become more demon-like, even demon-possessed, as they grow prideful, believing themselves to be the center of the world. In Russia, we call this the "Lenin syndrome." Lenin believed he was the smartest, criticized everyone else, and demanded worship. This mindset is the antithesis of Christian humility and virtue.  

True freedom in Christ leads to humility, peace in the heart, communion with the Lord, and the healing of the soul. It allows us to find and manifest the image of God within us, growing in His likeness. These are two entirely different paths, and there should be no confusion between them.  

May the Lord guide you on this path, granting you the joy of His salvation and the power of His resurrection, which revives and strengthens us. May we all overcome the delusions, temptations, and brokenness of this world. Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters. Christ is risen! Amen.
