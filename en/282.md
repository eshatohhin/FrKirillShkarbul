# Patriotism or Uranopolitism

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a world full of lies, and many people are trying to use others' love for their homeland to send them to war or to make them support one side of a conflict. It is very important for us as Christians to have a stance on the issue of patriotism or conscription. For example, if our country goes to war, do we need to support it? Or if our country is being invaded, do we need to fight for it? Or if another country goes to war, do we take a side? All these questions can be answered if we have a well-grounded position on what patriotism means in the context of Christian faith.

However, the question is not as simple as it may seem. While it may appear straightforward, it is very difficult to answer because even the saints had differing opinions on the matter. So, whatever I say today is not the official teaching of the Church, but rather something that the early Church felt, experienced, and derived directly from the understanding of the cross and the sacrifice that the Lord made for us to save us. Personally, I am convinced that this view is the Christian view.

What is this view? First, let me introduce some conflicting perspectives. The two most popular views are patriotism and support for patriotism. What is patriotism? It is love for your country, your nation, its history, and everything related to it that is good. It also involves respecting others. It is not fascism or narcissism, where you believe others are inferior, that you are the chosen, or that you are the best. Rather, it is the belief that your country is the best for you. No matter where you go or where you live—even if you reside elsewhere—the country you are from is your country, and you are patriotic; you love your country.

An extension of this view is whether you should be ready to go to war for your country in its interest. If you are conscripted or if something threatens your country, should you go to war? This goes beyond mere patriotism.

So these are, as you can see, two quite similar views. I will tell you right away that some saints indeed supported patriotism, and very few supported the idea of going to war if necessary. We can find biblical support for both of these views. Of course, everything is often taken out of context, but essentially, you can find verses to back these positions. I won’t go through all the verses today, but if you don’t believe me, you can find articles discussing this. Many people have written about it.

At the same time, there is another position that a great number of saints also supported, and we find biblical support for this as well. It’s called *Uranapolitism*. Uranapolitism means that your citizenship is in heaven. In this world, you don’t have a true citizenship. It doesn’t matter where you were born or where you live; what matters is heaven. We also find a lot of biblical support for this view. These two camps—patriotism and Uranapolitism—are often at odds with each other. There is almost no room for compromise. You’re either one or the other. If you read the discussions and debates on this topic, you’ll see that it’s often framed as a binary choice.

Before I share the early Church teaching that I found in several sources, I want to refer to the *Epistle to Diognetus*, most likely written by Saint Justin the Martyr, the philosopher, around the middle of the second century. But I’ll come back to that later. First, I want to discuss these two views and the dangers associated with each.

The first view is that patriotism is good and should be supported. Logically, if you support patriotism, you may feel compelled to go to war if necessary, especially in the case of a "just war." But what constitutes a just war? That’s one issue. Another is that you may not know who is ruling your country. Perhaps they are the worst enemies. Are you fighting for them or for your homeland? This is a difficult question that many face, including those in Russia today, though I don’t want to delve into politics. Additionally, there’s the risk of slipping into nationalism, where you might begin to believe that your country or nation is superior to all others. This can lead to making jokes about other nations or races, fostering racism, fascism, or even Nazism. I’m not saying every patriotic person goes down this path, but the risk exists.

On the other hand, Uranapolitism also carries risks. The biggest risk is that it can be conflated with cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is the idea that you are a citizen of the world. Many liberals and those who prioritize material wealth embrace cosmopolitanism because it means they can live wherever they feel most comfortable—where there’s more money, better salaries, better groceries, more comfortable housing, or better social security. It doesn’t matter what the country is called—whether it’s the U.S., Canada, or Europe. They say, "I’m a citizen of the world. I can go anywhere, live anywhere, and make money online from any place in the world." This mindset can lead to a detachment from any sense of responsibility or loyalty to a specific community or nation.

This hedonistic idea, which is very liberal and ecumenistic in nature, essentially uses Uranapolitism as a cover to justify itself. It’s as if someone says, "I’m a Uranapolitist, which is why I don’t care about the country I come from." But in reality, they are not Uranapolitists; they are cosmopolitans. There’s a big difference. Uranapolitism means that the heavenly kingdom is the most important, but cosmopolitans don’t care about heaven—they care only about earthly benefits. This is why it’s called cosmopolitanism. *Cosmos* refers to the world—this corrupted, filthy, materialistic world. Cosmopolitans serve the prince of this world, but they hide behind the fig leaf of Uranapolitism. This is a significant risk, and it’s very common among those who claim to advocate Uranapolitism.

Now, let me share the early Church’s understanding of this issue. The early Church’s perspective is as follows—I’m paraphrasing from memory, but you can find it in Chapter 5 of the *Epistle to Diognetus*. Essentially, it says that *any foreign country is my motherland, and every motherland is a foreign country*. This might sound like a paradox, but let’s think deeper about what it means. If you live in a foreign country—not where you were born—your ultimate motherland is heaven. However, the earthly place where you live, even if it’s a foreign country, becomes like a motherland to you. You respect its traditions and customs, love its people, obey its laws, and wish for its prosperity and peace. In this sense, it becomes your earthly motherland.

On the other hand, if you live in the country where you were born, even though it’s your motherland, you recognize that it’s like a hotel. You’re here temporarily, and you’ll eventually leave. This "hotel" is also influenced by evil, as the prince of this world rules here. So, you shouldn’t become overly attached to this place, thinking, "This is my home; everything is perfect because it’s my motherland." No, you don’t need that deep attachment. It’s just a temporary dwelling. You respect it, love the people here—even your enemies and persecutors—but your true motherland is in heaven.

In essence, the early Church’s teaching aligns with Uranapolitism, but it must be understood correctly. They use the metaphor of the body and soul: your body is physical and carnal, while your soul is spiritual and more important. If you are spiritual, you love God and spiritual things above all else. However, this doesn’t mean you hate your body. We are not Manichaeans—a Gnostic sect that believed the body is a prison and that all evil comes from matter. We know that our bodies can be the source of sinful desires—lust, gluttony, and other vices—but it’s not the body itself that’s guilty. It’s our perverted soul. We treat our bodies well, like a vessel or an instrument. You care for it, but you don’t idolize it or become overly attached to it.

In the same way, you love the place where you live now and make it your earthly homeland, but you don’t become obsessed with it. You don’t constantly lament, "I’m a foreigner, so far from my motherland." Instead, you live with a balanced perspective, recognizing that your true home is in heaven, while still respecting and caring for the earthly place where God has placed you.

No, you’re a Christian, and your true motherland is in heaven. Just face it. Wherever you are, do the mission of the Lord. The place you’re in right now is all transitory, and eventually, your journey to your loving Father will be complete through your life in this country. Another analogy I can offer is that of the heavenly Father and the physical father. If you love your heavenly Father, it doesn’t mean you have to hate your physical father or say, "Any man is the same—my father, your father, whoever’s father, it doesn’t matter." No, it does matter. Your father matters. You are called to obey and honor your father and mother. In the same way, treat your country like your physical father, with respect, while always prioritizing your heavenly Father.

I think the whole argument between patriotism and Uranapolitism arises because people mix everything together. Essentially, people are often carnally minded, so they pull Uranapolitism into the debate and say, "It’s either this or that—either you love your heavenly kingdom or your earthly motherland. You’re either a Uranapolitist or a patriot." But in reality, you can hold both perspectives in balance. The early Church wasn’t patriotic in the modern sense, nor was it cosmopolitan. Instead, it recognized different spheres: your heavenly kingdom is above everything, and your heart belongs to it completely. As for your earthly life, yes, you live here, but it’s all very transitory. Don’t make an idol of it.

Unfortunately, in many Orthodox countries, patriotism is often stressed to the point of becoming a fetish—an idol. People forget about their heavenly motherland and are even willing to die and kill for the interests of their earthly motherland, or worse, for the corrupt leaders who exploit their loyalty. May the Lord keep us away from such delusions and worldliness. I believe the gradual support for patriotism within the Church has become part of this process of worldliness. It’s not entirely bad, but it’s still progressing, and we must be cautious.

May the Lord keep us from being consumed by worldliness. May we love His kingdom above everything else, and may He make us true servants and witnesses of His kingdom, its love, and its self-sacrifice. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
