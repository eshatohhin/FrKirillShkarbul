# Who is antichrist

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about the Antichrist.  
Of course, we should primarily talk about Christ. This is our goal; this is our mission. Every Christian should share the word of Christ. However, Christ Himself warned us about what will happen at the end of the world. He cautioned His disciples about false prophets and false Christs who will come and deceive many people. He told us not to follow them and not to be misled by anyone who would come in His name, claiming to take His place.  

We also remember the words of St. John the Theologian, Apostle John, who wrote in his epistle that there are already many antichrists, and there will be a final Antichrist who will come. Apostle Paul also speaks about him. So, who are these false antichrists, and who will be the final Antichrist? Let me say a few words about these things.  

We must also recall the words of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, one of the Holy Fathers, who said that we need to share the message about the Antichrist with everyone as much as possible so that all may be warned. There is nothing wrong with this. This is not some conspiracy theory. We have no fear whatsoever regarding anything related to the Antichrist. We hope for the end of the world and the Second Coming of Christ. It will be allowed by God Himself that the Antichrist comes. In one of the readings from the Holy Fathers, I even saw that the Antichrist will be sent by God. Of course, this does not mean that God desires the Antichrist to come, but He will permit it to happen. This will be the logical and natural outcome of world history.  

What is the Antichrist? The prefix "anti" has two meanings: "instead of" and "against." The Antichrist will be both against Christ—an enemy of Christ—and in place of Christ, attempting to replace Him as a surrogate. In the days of the apostles and the early Church, the emperors of the Roman Empire, such as Nero and Domitian, were called antichrists because they claimed to save the people. They provided bread to the needy and demanded worship. The cult of the emperor led to the persecution of Christians for refusing to worship him or grant him divine honor. These emperors were considered small antichrists.  

Anyone who claims, "I am the savior; I will solve all your problems," or who implies divine authority, can be seen as a small antichrist. Many politicians and leaders throughout history have carried this message. In the 20th century, figures like Lenin and Hitler exemplify this. Lenin promised to liberate the proletariat and bring about a communist utopia, a substitute for heaven, offering welfare and salvation. Yet, his regime resulted in the deaths of millions who opposed his ideology. This is a clear image of the Antichrist: coming with seemingly good intentions and brilliant proposals but ultimately causing immense suffering and destruction.  

Any small antichrist operates in this way, and we must be aware of this. The final Antichrist will embody these traits. He will claim to liberate the persecuted, those in crisis or slavery, but his true nature will be one of deception and destruction. Let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our faith, always looking to Christ, our true Savior.

He will bring a semblance of salvation and hope, presenting himself as a savior. When he comes, he will appear very kind, polite, and charismatic, winning the admiration and even worship of many. However, his true nature will eventually be revealed, and he will persecute countless people, particularly targeting Christians who refuse to accept his mark—the mark of the beast. This mark will be required for anyone to engage in basic activities such as buying and selling, purchasing tickets, acquiring real estate, or even sending children to school. Without it, life will become nearly impossible.  

This desire for such a figure is deeply rooted in fallen human nature. Even the chosen people of Israel, who were God's own, rejected Christ because they expected a different kind of Messiah—one who would solve their political, economic, and social problems, restore Israel's glory, and free them from occupation and slavery. They longed for a perfect monarch and leader, not the humble Savior who came. This same craving for an Antichrist-like figure persists today across many religions and cultures.  

In Islam, for example, there are teachings that align with this expectation. We also see new sects emerging where individuals claim to be God, demanding worship. One such sect, even here in Taiwan, boasts over two million followers worldwide who believe a woman is divine. It is alarmingly easy to be deceived, especially when people are desperate for salvation.  

At some point, the world will descend into chaos—plagued by crises, pandemics, wars, and countless other problems. In this turmoil, everyone will yearn for someone to come and solve these issues. This is when the Antichrist will appear, and the devil himself will act through him. He will be cruel, treacherous, and utterly destructive, waging war against Christ and His Church. Those who refuse to accept his mark, choosing instead to remain loyal to Christ, will become saints. They will endure immense suffering, becoming marginalized and hunted, perhaps hiding in the mountains, living short and difficult lives.  

We must be aware of these things, for they will eventually come to pass. While we do not know when, we do know that the Antichrist will seek to unite all religions. Already, the boundaries between different faiths are blurring. Many who call themselves Christians no longer see the importance of doctrine, believing that being a "good person" is enough. They say, "As long as we can have pizza together, it doesn’t matter how you worship." This mindset is becoming increasingly common, paving the way for a one-world religion.  

In this future scenario, those who remain loyal to the true God, Jesus Christ, will be few and marginalized. They will stand firm in their faith, even as the world around them embraces the Antichrist. While I do not believe this will happen imminently, we must remain vigilant, rooted in our faith, and prepared for the trials that lie ahead.

We do not know when these events will unfold, but for now, it seems that most people are not yet fully deceived. The majority remain aware and discerning about such matters. However, we must remain vigilant and deeply committed to our faith. We cannot afford to become overly reliant on the material world and its comforts, for we must be prepared to sacrifice these worldly "goodies" for the sake of Christ.  

Let us hold Christ above all else and remain ready at all times, as He Himself instructed. We do not know when He will return or when these events will come to pass. May God grant us the faith, eagerness, and courage to stand firm in the face of tribulations and deception. The devil seeks to mislead even the chosen ones, for those who are not chosen will easily follow him. But the chosen ones will be his primary target—he will strive to trick, mislead, and trap them.  

May this never happen to any of us. May God bless you abundantly and grant you His peace. Let us remain steadfast in our faith, valuing Christ above all else, and preparing ourselves for the trials that may come.
