# “Know yourself” in Christianity vs. in psychology

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about a more practical topic in spiritual life: knowing ourselves. Very often, we hear about this in psychology and philosophy, but knowing ourselves in the Christian faith is a completely different concept. Of course, we know how important this is, even though we often don’t do anything to address it. We understand that if someone doesn’t know who they are, they are blind. They make mistakes all the time. They are like a bird hitting a window because they don’t know what they’re doing or what they are capable of. They just keep hitting the window over and over again. And this is often how our lives look because we don’t understand how our passions work. We were not educated about asceticism. We were not taught about who we are in relationship with God. As a result, we keep making significant mistakes, and our lives become more and more miserable. Eventually, we may realize that our whole life has been wasted. 

So today, let us talk about this. First of all, the key difference we can highlight is that in psychology, the main question is: *Who am I psychologically?* This involves understanding ourselves in terms of our relationships with others, our character, how we react to external circumstances, and the characteristics of our behavior in different situations. We learn about these things, and this approach is very much tied to this world. It is a rational and down-to-earth perspective. However, this down-to-earth approach limits a person, as though they are just a brain or a personality confined to this world. 

But what Christ, the Church, and the Holy Fathers teach us is far more important: we must discover who we are in relationship with God. This is the vertical, eternal perspective, because man is spiritual. He is created in the image of God and is a spiritual being. He can glorify God in spirit and truth. This is why it is much more important to understand this spiritual dimension, which, as we said, is connected to the physical. It is not something separate, but it is far more significant. We stand before God, and the question is: *Who are we? How does God see us?* We can only gain such understanding through grace and through Him opening our spiritual eyes. 

Presently, almost no one knows this about themselves. We don’t know who we are in this respect, and this is why people struggle so much with confession. What should we confess? "I’ve done this, I’ve done that." Sometimes, we can observe how children confess. We see that they truly feel the weight of their wrongdoing. For them, it’s not just a checkmark; they sense that they’ve lost something. Their understanding is more intuitive. When they think about their sins, it comes from a deeper place. For us, however, it often becomes a list: "This, this, this. Checkmark, checkmark." It’s very rationalistic. 

So how can we understand this? We need to grasp who we are before God and what we truly are. We will discover that we are far from Him and that, in ourselves, we are nothing good. But with Him, we can become everything. However, we must first understand that, on our own, we are nothing good. We need to humble ourselves. This is a great talent, and we know that most people don’t like criticism from others. We become uncomfortable when someone points out our flaws.

But this is when they say things that we don’t see in ourselves. That helps us to know ourselves, both in a psychological sense and in our relationship with God. So let’s go step by step. First of all, we can say there are three main teachers who can teach us and open our eyes on this matter. 

The first is the Gospel—the Word of God, what He has said and what He has done. When we read the Gospel, it’s as though we are looking into a mirror. In this mirror, we see the gap between God and ourselves. We discover how far we are from Him. This requires us to be very honest with ourselves. We need to say, "I want to be like that. This is my goal." So the Gospel is one of these mirrors. 

Another mirror is others—our relationships with the people we live with. And this is not just about social relationships. Most importantly, it’s about how we live with others in light of the Gospel. Are we willing to help? Are we willing to sacrifice ourselves? Are we humble when someone criticizes us, or do we get angry? The Lord said, *"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness."* This righteousness also refers to the truth and a true vision of ourselves—understanding who we are. This is why, when our weaknesses or sins are exposed by others, we should receive it with joy in our hearts. Then we will be blessed. 

This is why we have a church community—a community of saints. It is meant to be a place where everyone interacts and helps expose sins. If someone lives with a sin and doesn’t recognize it as such, they don’t see that their relationship with God is broken. It could be anything—dishonesty, disrespect toward parents, or anything else. They think, "This is just how I am," but they don’t see the truth. They are blind. The community of saints is meant to help them discover this—with love, with compassion. The goal is to have a system of checks and balances, where others help us. If our faith is weakened, if we’re struggling and don’t trust in the Lord, others need to tell us, "Hey, you don’t know how to pray? Let’s pray together. You’ll see how to ask the Lord for His grace." This is very important—our relationships, especially with the people of God, the members of the church. 

Of course, other people are also important. The Lord can speak to us through anyone—even through animals. We remember in the Old Testament how God spoke to the prophet through an ox. So anyone, especially children, can teach us. We often disregard children, thinking they don’t know anything, but this is wrong. A child can tell us things that no one else can. God may be speaking to us through anyone. That’s why we need to have the fear of God. One of the signs that someone has a true vision of themselves is the fear of God they possess—not fear of people, not fear of circumstances like lacking money, but fear of God. Today, almost no one has this. Living as though God is watching us, as though we are standing before Him, is one of the signs of spiritual health. 

The third teacher is our own conscience, and we have repentance for this purpose. This is what we must do. We need to see that we are far from God, be willing to repent, and change. Repentance means turning back to God, going back to the Lord, changing our ways and our mindset. It requires a profound, deep breaking of our old self. We need to recognize when our old self is emerging and tell it, "Go back." 

In summary, the three teachers are: the Gospel, which shows us the truth about ourselves in relation to God; others, especially the community of saints, who help us see our blind spots; and our own conscience, which calls us to repentance and transformation. Through these, we can grow in self-knowledge and draw closer to God.

Okay, so let us reflect on these things. This is why we have fasting in the Church. Fasting is not just about following rules—don’t do this, don’t eat that. It is meant to help us discover who we are, teach us repentance, and guide us back to living with the Lord. Many people suffer because they do not know these things—these basic ascetic principles of Christian life. Some people may know about them but fail to put them into practice, which is another problem. Knowing something means nothing if we do not apply it to our lives. 

Let me give a practical example. Most people experience some kind of sorrow in their lives, often something significant. It could be a divorce, loneliness, struggles with children, or stress from work or other circumstances. Very often, these issues are family-oriented, and the person feels alone. There may also be stress from their job, their living situation, or anything else. The person may not realize that they are being driven by passions like vainglory. When we don’t know ourselves, we don’t truly understand our passions. Vainglory whispers to us, "You can do this. You are important. Set these goals, and you will achieve them." The person, driven by vainglory, pursues these goals, fails, and becomes disappointed. They may blame others, but if we are honest, we will recognize that we are the main reason for most of our problems. 

What happens next? There are two common ways people react to this sorrow or depression. They either become deeply depressed and gloomy or grow angry and aggressive. These are the two typical responses to such sorrow. To cope, people try to suppress their pain. Some turn to alcohol and become alcoholics. Others go out partying every day, watch movies, play computer games, or engage in sinful practices like adultery. Very often, these coping mechanisms are tied to sin. It’s better if they can find a hobby that isn’t sinful to distract themselves, but the most important solution is for them to discover the root cause: their passions. They need to realize that their struggles stem from not having God in their hearts and never having learned to establish a relationship with Him. 

A big surprise awaits them when their life ends. Now is the time to establish this relationship with God and to find that Christ is our only hope. He can fulfill everything we need, but we must learn how to fight our passions. Let us see that this is happening every day. People commit suicide, drink, do drugs, and engage in other destructive behaviors. This is not just theory—it is happening to us and to those around us. Even if people seem happy, many are struggling deeply. 

Let us be very serious about this. The devil is trying to steal our lives and lead us astray. We need to be knowledgeable about these things, even if we didn’t learn them from childhood. Now is the time to learn the basics of Orthodox asceticism and spiritual life, to open our spiritual eyes, and to see ourselves clearly so that our passions no longer control us. 

May the Lord help each of you on this path, grant you joy, spiritual health, and His blessing. Amen.
