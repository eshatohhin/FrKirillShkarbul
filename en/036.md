# Two kinds of people in Apocalypse

Dear brothers and sisters, today our topic will be somewhat mysterious. We will talk about the Revelation of Saint John the Apostle. Many people are saying that the last days are coming, and the apocalypse is approaching with these pandemics, the changing world, and many other events. People are worried, and many are reading Revelation these days. However, I would suggest that only Christians who are very well trained—those who have read the Gospels and the Epistles many times, who read them daily, pray every day, and have been attending church for years—should directly read Revelation. Otherwise, you might misunderstand many things and even receive some harm. Revelation is a very special book. It is a prophecy given through visions and symbols, and it requires some training and a strong spiritual foundation to understand it properly—unless you are very spiritually mature. But I would not recommend reading it casually.

If you want to know more about this book, I would recommend listening to the Holy Fathers, reading their interpretations, and exploring other commentaries from the voice of the Church. Gather different interpretations of this book and reflect on them. However, if you are not yet firmly established in your faith, it is best to focus on strengthening your faith rather than becoming obsessed with the end times, Revelation, and the mysteries hidden within this book.

Today, we will discuss one of these mysteries. We will focus on Chapter 6, verse 9. Let us begin here:  
*"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 'How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?' And white robes were given unto every one of them, and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."*  

We do not need to understand this passage literally, but we must reflect deeply on its meaning. Essentially, this passage reveals that there are two types of people. If you feel that you are not one of them, you either are but do not yet realize it, or you will soon become one. These two types of people can be seen as spiritual descendants of Cain and Abel. As you know, Cain killed Abel, the two sons of Adam. The first group consists of those who persecute Christians, the servants of God, and the martyrs. They reject Christianity, justice, and the testimony of truth. They desire to live in sin, serving sin, mammon (wealth), and worldly desires. They want a world order that operates without God, without His providence, without righteousness, and without Christian values. This is the post-Christian world they seek.

It is not necessary to physically kill Christians to achieve this. If you destroy Christianity—if you close churches, silence its voice, and erase its influence—you are effectively killing it. In the West, we see this post-Christian society being built. How has it come about? Christianity is being killed by these people. Similarly, in the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks destroyed everyone who believed in God—priests, believers, and all who upheld the faith.

They demolished churches and sought to create a completely materialistic, atheistic society. These are the modern descendants of those who killed Christians. This is the reality we face today. The "new world order" that people speak of is, for them, a world without true Christianity. There may be some form of counterfeit Christianity, but it will lack the true message of repentance and a life lived according to the holy commandments. This is the choice people are making—a choice they desire and crave.  

It will become increasingly difficult to say, "I just want to live quietly, minding my own business. I’m not harming anyone. I’m tolerant of everything." This neutrality will not be possible because, eventually, everyone will be forced to choose a way of life. You will lean toward one of two lifestyles: either that of the descendants of Cain, who reject God, or that of the servants of God, who are few in number. These servants are the ones who are killed for the word of God, for their testimony, and for their righteous lives.  

In the Book of Revelation, we read that at the end of times, the majority of humanity will belong to the first group—those who reject God. The punishments described in Revelation will come because they refuse to repent and turn to God. This is the situation we are approaching, and in many ways, it is already here.  

You might ask, "If I believe in Christ and truly want to follow Him, does that mean I will have to be killed?" Not necessarily, but we are called to die to ourselves daily. We kill our old selves, our passions, and our sinful desires. Our daily life is a form of extended martyrdom, a continuous sacrifice. This makes us heirs and fellow servants of those Christians who were killed and who cried out to the Lord, "How long will You endure the evil done by those who reject You?"  

This world, built on the rejection of Christianity and the persecution of Christians—whether in the West, the Soviet Union, or pagan nations—is becoming increasingly hostile to Christ. People are choosing a path that refuses Him, effectively killing Him in their hearts. This is not limited to Christian countries; it is a global phenomenon.  

Let us be mindful of this reality. The time of harvest is approaching. As the end draws near, things will become clearer, and the rejection of Christ will grow more evident. Let us prepare ourselves by loving Christ, serving Him, and sacrificing our hearts for others. Let us grow stronger spiritually each day. May the Lord help and bless you. Amen.
