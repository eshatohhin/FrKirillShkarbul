# Is human life the highest value Humanism vs. Fundamentalism

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord himself said, 'Fear not those who kill the body, but I tell you whom you should be afraid of; fear the one who can destroy both the soul and the body in the gehenna of fire, that is God himself.'

These words sound terrifying because, in our fallen imagination, we often picture God as rosy and benevolent, like Santa Claus. We imagine Him always smiling and giving us good things because He loves us, right? Well, this is our emotional and corrupt understanding of love. The love of the Lord is different—it is *the* love. He cares about the salvation of your soul, and everything that impedes this salvation is hated by Him.

Today, I want to address something very important, something about which we have so many misunderstandings within the church, among the clergy, and even with the bishops. There are two prevailing ideas about human life. The most basic thing, which we fail to grasp because we are too worldly, is this: the first idea, common to most people, stems from the Renaissance and its anthropocentric worldview. It holds that human life is the highest value, an absolute value that must be protected at all costs, with nothing more important than human life. After the Holocaust and the terrible wars we have endured, we have even greater appreciation for human life. Yet, in practice, there is a disregard for this belief. People claim to value human life, but in reality, we see that this is not how the world operates. People kill each other constantly and economically destroy one another. This is another significant issue, but today I am focusing on conceptual matters.

Within the church, there are those who support this view, but this view is not biblical. It arises from a merging of ancient Greek culture and Christianity, elevating human life to an absolute value. This is why we have human rights, human freedoms, and all this democracy, which is ultimately fake. People talk about these things, but they are used to manipulate others. Conceptually, these ideas are approved and accepted, and there are those who fight for human rights. However, this can lead to a dictatorship based on such beliefs—like a dictatorship of those who prioritize ecology or the environment above all else, even at the expense of the economy and everything else. This is postmodernism. Modernism, on the other hand, is more centered on human life, progress, and technological advancement. I don’t want to delve into this today. Instead, I want to highlight the problem with this worldview, this idea about human life, and its opposite.

The opposite view asserts that human life is not the absolute value and that there are many other things more important. I will discuss this in a moment because the truth lies neither here nor there. The truth, as the Lord tells us, is different. Why can we say this? From the Old Testament onward, human life was never the highest value in the Bible. This is even more difficult to understand when we see the Lord destroying sinners. For example, three thousand people died after worshipping the golden calf. Why were they not given the opportunity to repent? Why were they destroyed? Why did the person who helped hold the Ark of the Covenant fall dead by the Lord’s punishment? Why did Pharaoh die? Why did the Lord bless the wars the Israelites fought against the nations occupying the Promised Land? Why so much bloodshed and destruction, all blessed by the Lord? These examples create many problems for us in explaining how this was possible in the Old Testament but seemingly not in the New Testament. However, the conclusion we can draw from these examples and from the Lord’s own words is that there are absolute values higher than human life.

For the Lord, the salvation of the human soul is more important than physical life. This is why He says, "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." When people came to Jesus and told Him about the 18 who died when the tower of Siloam fell, He did not respond with, "I will pray for them. I am so sorry to hear this bad news. Let us pray for their souls and help their families." Instead, He said, "Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." His words were strict, showing no compassion for those who died. This is a stark reminder to us that repentance matters more to the Lord than our physical life, health, economic well-being, or anything else we possess. Our repentance and our life with the Lord—or in sin and against His will—are far more important to Him than anything else.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, there is a more fundamentalist view, even within the church. These fundamentalists point to the wars, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and argue that human life is relative and does not matter much to the Lord. They claim that the Lord has grand projects to accomplish, and these projects are far more important than human life. They believe that sacrifices must be made—for example, fighting for an Orthodox country, even if it means dying without hesitation. They justify destroying those who hold the values of Sodom and Gomorrah, even if it results in the deaths of hundreds of thousands. They say, "If the Lord allows them to die, so be it. We do not care; we just go and do it." This is a fascist and even Satanic mindset, known as *fatalistic justification of death*. It is particularly dangerous when held by people within the church.

We have even heard speakers suggest that revolutions, like those in Russia, could be stopped by using force—by killing all who oppose and thus "fixing" the problem. This mindset is far more dangerous than the liberal one. It is based on a false understanding of Scripture and seeks religious sanction for violence. Such individuals believe the church and the Bible endorse their actions, but the Lord Himself warned that a time would come when people would kill others, thinking they are serving God. We are living in such times.

The problem with this kind of thinking is multifaceted. First, the Lord created humans and gave us life. He delights in seeing us live and thrive, just as a parent rejoices to see their child playing in the backyard. The Lord finds joy in our existence and our actions. However, if a child behaves badly—causing suffering, disobeying, and even rebelling against their parent—the parent's attitude will change. The parent may tolerate it for a time, seeking ways to correct the behavior through conversation and guidance. But if the situation worsens, the parent will take action to address it. Similarly, the Lord, in His love and justice, will intervene when His children persist in sin and rebellion.

In the same way, if the Lord sees someone bringing evil, destruction, and suffering, He will find a way to address it. He may not destroy them outright; perhaps He will render them incapable or take some other action. We do not know the specifics—it is the Lord’s judgment, not ours. We are not called to judge; He will execute His judgment. As the Psalms say, "The wicked will not live out half their days." Those who are killers and deceivers often die young, though there are exceptions—some evildoers live long lives, perhaps because the Lord has a special plan for them. We do not make judgments, but we know that the Lord will not tolerate the life of someone who spreads evil, lies, and leads others into sin and destruction indefinitely. The Lord is long-suffering, but His patience is not unlimited. There will come an end to it. As the Psalms also say, "You may see the wicked flourishing, but when you look again, they will be gone." This is how things unfold.

Today, politicians and even some within the church misuse the Gospel and the Bible to justify their political agendas, including wars and other actions. We can look back to the time of Jesus, when the Roman Empire occupied Israel. There were those who sought to reclaim their land, believing it was their divine right as God’s chosen people. They saw driving out the Romans as fulfilling God’s plan. Yet, what was Jesus’ attitude? He neither supported nor opposed the zealot movement. Instead, He distanced Himself from it, focusing on calling the children of Israel to repentance, truth, and salvation. This was His priority.

In today’s church, however, we see priests and bishops taking sides in political conflicts, using the Bible to justify actions like war, killing, and sacrifice. They claim, "You must fight to protect others," or "You must sacrifice yourselves for the greater good." But this is entirely contrary to the attitude and teachings of Jesus. Whether it is Ukraine being invaded by Russia, or Russia being pressured by the West or globalist forces, no political paradigm finds support in the life and preaching of Jesus Christ. He did not justify war or take sides in worldly conflicts. Yet, what we see today is an attachment to worldly interests—power, control, and alliances—leading some to call Christians to kill in the name of righteousness.

This reveals a troubling reality: many people’s minds and hearts have been "hacked." They make wrong decisions, take wrong actions, and lead others astray. As Jesus warned, "If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit." Those who are spiritually blind not only risk their own destruction but also drag others down with them. This is a sobering reminder to seek the truth in Christ, not in the flawed and often corrupt agendas of the world.

We must be very careful about what we hear, even from church leaders and spiritual authorities. Always turn to the Gospel and the teachings of the Holy Fathers for guidance. We must also recognize that earthly interests—such as defending "Orthodox countries," protecting borders, or fulfilling duties to the homeland—can sometimes conflict with our duty to God. While there is a responsibility to one’s homeland, the question arises: who truly represents the interests of the country and its people? In modern times, governments may not always act in the best interest of their citizens. We cannot be naive; the world today is vastly different from 2000 or even 100 years ago. 

During imperialistic wars, like World War I, many fought without truly understanding why or for whom they were fighting. The same can be said today. You may believe you are dying for your country, but in reality, you might be dying for an agenda you are unaware of. Even if it were for your country and people, the Gospel does not provide justification for such actions. While it may be your duty as a citizen, do not misuse the Gospel to rationalize it.

This is why we must be wise and delve deeply into the Word of God. Do not simply accept interpretations from those who use Scripture to justify political agendas. Instead, seek to understand the Word as the Holy Church and the Holy Fathers have taught us—truths that lead to salvation. Above all, we must live in repentance. Without this, our lives lose their meaning and value in the eyes of the Lord.

Let us strive to live righteously, seeking the Kingdom of Heaven and its truth every day. God bless.
