# Internal problems of the Church salt loses taste

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
We are now in the celebration of Holy Pascha, the Lord's resurrection, but this celebration is somewhat darkened by what is happening in the world, in Orthodox countries, and within the Church itself.  

I would rather, of course, talk about high spiritual matters—the Divine Liturgy, glorifying God, the profound meaning of the Gospel, and the teachings of the Holy Fathers. However, we must address the problems we are facing. If we do not work to resolve them, discussing higher spiritual matters becomes meaningless.  

This is why today's topic is something we need to reflect on deeply. Often, we think that problems come from external sources—enemies of the Church, political forces, or the devil. Yet, most of the problems stem from within us, from the spiritual state of the Church as a whole and of every Christian, each member of the Church.  

People do not like to talk about this, which is why prophets were often unpopular. They spoke uncomfortable truths and offered criticism. Remember Ahaz: 400 false prophets told him pleasant things, but only one, Micah, spoke the harsh truth. He warned of defeat and death, and that is exactly what happened. When a message comes from the Lord, it is often unpleasant, and people shy away from it.  

We prefer to come to Church and hear comforting words: everything will be fine, peace and happiness will prevail, and God's blessings will be with us. We enjoy these words and return home feeling at ease, as if all is well. On the other extreme, some people spread fear and paranoia, claiming the Antichrist is here, everything is marked by 666, and demons are everywhere. This breeds fear and what we might call "Orthodox paranoia."  

The Church is called to do neither of these things. The Church is called to awaken people, to bring them to vigilance, and to motivate them to engage in spiritual warfare. We must face reality as it is and live a spiritual life, discovering what it means to rise above earthly desires, selfishness, and the "old self," and instead serve the Lord and Christ.  

Today, we see Orthodox countries at war, the Church divided, and numerous internal problems. It is easy to blame external forces—other countries, corporations, or global powers—but the root of the problem lies within us. When we lose our spiritual immunity and health, demons and enemies of the Church seize the opportunity. Only then does the Lord allow them to succeed, bringing chaos to the Church, suffering, wars, and other trials to Orthodox people and nations.  

Let us focus on the spiritual state we are in. The problems exist both at the individual level, among laypeople, and at the institutional level of the Church. I want to address this because many come to the Church with unrealistic expectations, imagining it to be like heaven. But the Church on Earth is not heaven; it is more like an army. In an army, there are losses, unfit soldiers, and even those who sabotage their own side. This is a war—a spiritual war—and in this war, you will witness many ugly things.  

We see that few are praying, and fewer still desire to pray.

Come to Church—even in Orthodox countries, not many people do. During regular services, such as the Divine Liturgy on Sundays, perhaps only 1-2% of the population attends, even though 70-90% identify as Orthodox. They consider themselves Orthodox, yet they feel no need to attend Church regularly—perhaps only once or twice a year. But this is not following Christ. It means they disregard Holy Communion, confession, and the transformative power of faith. They live their daily lives focused on enjoyment—buying things, traveling, and pursuing worldly pleasures. They may say, "Yes, I believe," but their faith does not influence their lives. Their values remain unchanged, and their way of life stays the same.  

Then, when the Lord allows trials—war, sickness, or other hardships—people rush to Church to pray, seeking immediate relief. But once their prayers are answered, they disappear again. This is not following Christ. We cannot expect to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven so easily. It is not a simple or effortless journey.  

Even among those who attend Church regularly, many live in sin, consumed by passions. We must be honest with ourselves. And even when there is no major sin, we often treat prayer and divine services as mere therapy. We listen to the music, feel a sense of peace, and go home. But this is not prayer. Prayer is a dialogue with God. It requires active participation, understanding, and offering oneself as a living sacrifice during the Liturgy, partaking in the Lord's Supper. Yet, few of us truly engage in this way.  

Many do not read about their faith or seek to understand it. They are lazy, busy, or preoccupied with family matters. They spend hours on social media but have no time for spiritual reading—not even the basics of catechism. Most have never opened a book on faith, yet they consider themselves knowledgeable.  

This is not just a problem among laypeople. If 80% of people are baptized but only 1% attend Church, where are the rest? Baptism is not a magical act that instantly transforms someone into a saint. If you do not understand the New Covenant—that you are now in Christ and must live in this Covenant—if you do not recognize the need to die to your old self, then of course you will not see the value of attending Church. You will continue living as you always have.  

This is a significant, structural problem within the Church. Not everywhere, of course—there are parishes where preparation for baptism takes six months, a year, or even longer. Those who wish to become Orthodox must fully understand the Covenant they are entering. Yet, even among those who attend Church, many lack a spiritual guide or father to turn to for advice. Everyone is autonomous, believing they know everything. The same applies to priests, who often lack spiritual supervision. This is a strange and troubling situation.  

As a result, people drift further away. Our passions, the deceit of the world, our selfishness, and pride remain. Evil spirits are still at work, trying to drag us away from following Christ and the path to salvation. And when we lose sight of this path, we lose everything.

and we don't understand what is happening. Why does the Lord allow trials—sicknesses, hardships, and other challenges? He is trying to draw us back into spiritual life. Yet, even within the clergy and the Church, after gaining freedom in post-communist countries, the primary focus was not spiritual revival. Instead, the emphasis was on building—more churches, more golden decorations, more external beauty. But this is like a bubble. It is superficial.  

Some people focus on photographs of church events, posting them on Instagram or Facebook, admiring how beautiful everything looks. But this is nothing. All these external things are like smoke—they vanish. Without a solid foundation, they can be shattered in an instant. The true foundation is Jesus Christ and spiritual life. If a monastery is not rooted in prayer and spiritual life but is instead focused on construction, publishing, or other external activities, it lacks the necessary spiritual basis. Without this foundation, no matter how grand the building, it will not withstand trials—war, revolution, or any other upheaval.  

The Lord told us, "You are the salt of the earth." But if the salt loses its flavor, it is useless. People will trample it underfoot. We have become salt that has lost its flavor. We must feel the responsibility and dignity the Lord has given to each of us—not just clergy or bishops, but every faithful believer. In the Old Testament, most prophets were not priests; they were ordinary people. Therefore, we cannot expect spiritual renewal to come solely from the clergy or the institutional Church. It must begin with each of us.  

We must live a spiritual life and consider how we can contribute to the spiritual renewal of the Church as a whole. Yet, we are often passive. We do not want to move, to serve others, or to engage in ministry within the Church. We avoid involvement in social work or community life, even though these are important aspects of the Church's mission. Instead, we prefer to sit back, enjoy our own lives, and let the Church drift into complacency. This is why we are losing our way.  

The Lord is watching this. This is not the Church He desires. He may allow trials—Napoleon, Hitler, or other forces—to shake us awake. We must change. We must think deeply about our spiritual condition.  

Let us recall Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov, a great spiritual father of the 19th century. He predicted the catastrophes of the 20th century—revolutions, wars, and the great trials the Church would face. He saw these things decades before they happened. At a time when many churches were being built, books were being published, and everything seemed prosperous, he warned of a deep spiritual crisis within the Church. People called him crazy, saying, "Everything is going well—what are you talking about?" But he was like the prophet Micah, speaking uncomfortable truths that no one wanted to hear.  

Saint Ignatius warned that the spirit of the Antichrist is not only outside the Church but also within it. Anyone who serves their "old self" carries this spirit. Even within the Church, many serve the Antichrist unknowingly. This is why we must abandon the rosy picture of the Church as paradise on Earth.  

The Church is not paradise; it is a hospital for sinners, a battlefield in the spiritual war. We must awaken to this reality, live a genuine spiritual life, and rebuild the Church on the foundation of Christ. Only then can we withstand the trials of this world and fulfill our calling as the salt of the earth.

But at the same time, Saint Ignatius also assured us that the Lord will preserve His Church through all these troubles. Similarly, Saint Seraphim of Sarov, when asked about the challenges facing the Church, reminded us of the Lord's words to the prophet Elijah. Elijah lamented that he was the only one left who worshipped the true God, but the Lord revealed that He had preserved 7,000 faithful who had not bowed their knee to Baal. Seven thousand out of perhaps three million—a small percentage, but a remnant nonetheless. Today, the number of the faithful is much greater.  

Even in these difficult times, when we see so many problems within the Church, we must remember that the Lord is preserving His people—those who have chosen Him and His truth. We must strive to be among those people. We must work more actively and decisively to change ourselves, to contribute to the fight against evil on every level, and to resist the spirit of the Antichrist.  

May the Lord help us. May He grant us the grace to be the salt of the earth, to live according to our calling, and to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. In this time of darkness and apostasy, may we keep the Lord's commandments and be His witnesses to the ends of the earth. As He said, "You will be My witnesses." We must bear witness to His love, His grace, and His salvation.  

May the Lord bless us and fill us with the joy of His resurrection. Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!
