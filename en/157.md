# Where is the world going The “new” goal of the mammon.

Dear brothers and sisters, in today's and the next video, I want to talk about what is happening in this world and where we are headed. Understanding the overall reality will help us avoid significant mistakes, enabling us to sense the spirit of the Antichrist and guard ourselves against it, so that we may remain with Christ. The spirit of mammon is pervasive and has worsened over the last 200 years. It manifests in various forms, and it's not as though the spirit of the Antichrist did not exist before this time. Of course, it has always been present. However, now this mammon, this prince of the world, about which Christ spoke extensively, has gained much more influence over people everywhere, in all countries across the globe. It has escalated to a new level.

As Christians, we desire to be free from these influences. We aim to thwart all the plans of the adversary. To do so, we need to understand and grasp this beast, this serpent, and prevent it from infiltrating our hearts, our world, and the Church. It is attempting to seep into every crevice. Over the last two centuries, we have witnessed the rise of capitalism. Prior to this, particularly before the French and English Revolutions in the West, the progression was more gradual. While we won't delve deeply into the historical development, it's clear that there was a significant shift from a world where certain ideals or ideas were the primary drivers of human behavior to one where money and income became the predominant motivators.

Before this shift, there were many different eras. I'm not suggesting that everything was perfect or good. There were times of crusades, where people were driven by certain ideals and fought for them. There were periods of religious wars in Europe, where people battled for what they believed to be the truth. There were times of romanticism, of knights, honor, dignity, monarchy, and familial relationships within nations, among many other things. However, all of that faded after the Industrial Revolution, and the primary motivation became income and a focus on individual prosperity and well-being. This shift influenced everything.

If you wish to understand more about this, we can refer to the Communist Manifesto, which provides a fairly honest analysis of the changes that occurred during that time. For the authors, these developments were positive, as they stemmed from capitalism and aimed to create something new. Let us reflect more deeply on this transformation. It was, in a sense, the victory of mammon, as it directly grasped everyone and declared, "Now, the most important thing is earthly production, money, and benefit—just go for it." This led to a significant boost in production, efficiency, science, and technology, all of which were very practically oriented. The focus was on growing more, building more machines, and improving communication to deliver goods.

While this great boost can be seen as positive, we must also consider the motivation behind it. Primarily, it was driven by mammon, with everything else contributing to this end. Of course, this also represents a kind of maturity for mankind, as we have come to better understand the laws of the world and nature. It's not all evil, and we shouldn't dismiss all scientific and technological advancements as inherently bad, nor should we view those who advocate for a return to older values as mere reactionaries. The key is to separate these aspects. Here, we are discussing the broader social and value dimensions of human existence.

So all these desires were awakened: now there is more entrepreneurship, you need to be more creative, you need to compete with each other, you need to work longer hours. People were willing to work more to earn more money, and this influenced every level of society. Naturally, this was a cause for celebration for mammon. Mammon thrives when people stop thinking about God, prayer, or salvation, and instead focus on material comforts like nice houses, goods, and convenience. This shift was very much in line with what mammon desires, which is why its followers praise this system. However, this appears to be only a stage for mammon to reach its next goal: the establishment of a kind of kingdom of mammon, which we might call the Kingdom of the Antichrist. This kingdom is the fruit of all-encompassing mammonism—let’s call it that rather than capitalism. The result of this mammonism will be a kingdom unlike any before, though in some ways it will resemble past systems.

The rough idea of this kingdom was developed by 19th-century communists like Marx, Engels, and other socialists. They envisioned what the future might look like, and they were intelligent individuals—not to be dismissed as foolish. We shouldn’t assume that Marxism is entirely dead or irrelevant. In fact, it is resurfacing in new forms, such as inclusive capitalism, which represents a new stage of capitalist development. These thinkers had a vision, but their model was still clumsy and premature. They attempted to impose it immediately, but they couldn’t implement it globally. The degradation of the world doesn’t happen overnight; stepping away from Christ and other ideals is a gradual process.

First, let’s discuss capitalism itself. It became so all-encompassing that every country in the world had to adapt. Nations that failed to keep up with the Industrial Revolution and its associated values were destined to decline. Mammon bases itself on the material world, striving to create systems that are unshakable and well-grounded. It is not an abstract concept but is rooted in tangible things like economics, politics, and human values. This is the essence of materialistic dialectics or Spinoza’s ideas—though that’s a separate topic. Mammon is deeply embedded in industrial and economic development, and any nation that falls behind risks destruction. This includes countries like China, Russia, and others. If you’re not keeping up, you’ll be left behind.

However, countries like Russia posed a challenge to this global progression. While Russia became heavily influenced by mammon and capitalism, it didn’t fully align with the overarching plan. It acted as a reactive force, blocking the global advancement toward these new ideas. As a result, those pushing this vision decided to impose it by force on resistant nations like Russia, China, Eastern Europe, and others. They sought to accelerate the process, even if it meant using coercion to bring these regions into alignment with their vision for the future.

So, they decided to use these countries as a prototype for this envisioned kingdom. By doing so, they also aimed to socialize the capitalist countries, making them more socialistic. This process took many different forms, and while it’s not as simple as I’m describing here, I’m speaking in general terms. This is what they did, and it was very successful. They managed to implement these ideas in those countries, though the model was rough and clumsy. It couldn’t sustain itself because it wasn’t well-grounded in capitalism, and the people weren’t fully "capitalized" yet. However, it destroyed the culture, values, and everything in those societies. After the collapse of these socialist systems—even as recently as 30 years ago—the people in these countries became even more capitalistic in their mindset than those in the West. 

If you look at post-Soviet societies or China today, they are even more obsessed with money than Western societies. They’ve become more willing to sell themselves, more broken, and more deeply influenced by mammon. These societies were essentially "hacked" by communism, making them more susceptible to embracing mammon than anywhere else. This paves the way for the successful construction of the future world envisioned by those 19th-century thinkers. We are now moving toward the next level, the next stage of their plan.

This next world needs to be understood. In the 19th century, when the West was fully capitalist and the rest of the world was becoming capitalist, the seeds of communism and socialism began to sprout everywhere. These movements were seen as the future, and in some ways, they were even worse than regular capitalism in terms of their alignment with mammon. While traditional capitalists were driven by profit and income, these new ideologies represented something more insidious. 

Now, we need to identify the forerunners of this future world. There are many of them, but I’ll save that discussion for the next video, as it’s too much to cover in one session. For now, I want to ask each of you to reflect on how the spirit of mammon—capitalism, profit, and material benefit—has penetrated your life, your family, and the organizations you’re part of. Everything has changed because of this shift. Even the Church has been affected, particularly Protestant and Catholic churches, and to some extent, Orthodox churches as well. Organizations have become very down-to-earth, focused on what can be achieved in this world. We engage in projects to reduce pollution, help poor countries, and so on. While these efforts seem good, they reflect a very earthly approach. Survival is increasingly based on how much money we have, and there’s less focus on the Kingdom of Heaven, its truth, Jesus Christ, holy living, and the sacraments. The emphasis has shifted to a more materialistic, down-to-earth perspective.

And this applies to other areas as well—your country, your social organizations, or any group you participate in. You can see these influences everywhere. First, we need to recognize this initial stage of mammon conquering the world. Next time, we’ll discuss the second stage that is coming—a significant new phase. Of course, there have been many smaller sub-stages along the way, and we can also look back in history to see similar patterns, though on a much smaller scale. For example, we see this in the history of the Byzantine Empire, where society declared itself Christian but lived according to mammon, and punishment followed. The same happened in Russia, which declared itself Orthodox and Christian but increasingly lived by mammon, leading to the Russian Revolution. There are countless examples, even in the Old Testament, where Israel turned away from worshipping God to worshipping Baal and false idols of prosperity, believing these would bring them well-being. Instead, they faced consequences.

This spirit of the Antichrist has always been present in humanity, but now it is reaching a new level. Let us reflect on this and strive not to become slaves to the spirit of mammon. Let us also help those around us overcome this mindset, this deep drive that pushes us to want more and more. We must free ourselves from it.

May the Lord help us, protect us from deceit and passion, and keep us steadfast on the path to salvation by the grace of His Holy Spirit. Amen. God bless.
