# Faith is not a belief and not a feeling!

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to share a few words about a very important topic: What is faith? There are many misconceptions about faith, and I want to address some of them. I’m specifically talking about faith in Christ, faith in God.

Sometimes, we think that faith is simply belief, but this is incorrect. Belief, in this sense, is like believing in something—such as aliens or a fourth dimension. Faith is not merely belief. Another misconception is that faith is a feeling, a religious emotion. We might feel peace or consolation in church, but this is more of a psychological experience, not faith itself. This is also incorrect. A third misconception is that faith is a system of rituals—lighting candles, wearing crosses, or making the sign of the cross when we pray. These actions, while meaningful, are not faith in themselves.

So, what is faith? Understanding this will help us transform our lives in Christ. In the Gospel of John 14:12, we read, "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father." In the original text, it says, "whoever has faith in me," not just "whoever believes in me." The one who has faith in Christ will do the works of Christ. If we are not doing these works, we do not truly have faith in Him.

There is a common misconception that simply believing in Christ—that He is the Savior, the Messiah—is enough. We might say, "I believe, hallelujah, I am saved, I am justified," and think that’s the end of it. But if our belief in Christ is like believing that Einstein was the greatest scientist or that parallel universes or aliens exist, it doesn’t change our lives unless we are deeply obsessed with these ideas. For most people, such beliefs don’t affect how they treat others, make decisions, or shape their inner world and values. If this is the case, our faith is meaningless. It’s like owning a book that sits on a shelf, unread. You have it, but it doesn’t impact your life in any way.

In the same way, if we merely believe in Christ but live as though His teachings have no effect on us, as though He isn’t transforming us, then our faith is nothing. It is empty. We are no different from pagans who believe in many things but are not changed by them. This is a significant misconception we must overcome. True faith in Christ should transform us, guiding our actions, choices, and values. It should be alive and active, not passive or superficial.

Another important misconception is that faith is merely a religious feeling. For example, some might say, "I feel tranquility in church, I have good, kind feelings, and a sense of mercy in my heart." But this is not faith. In fact, it can replace real faith and lead us in a completely opposite direction from where we should be. How does this happen? When we come to church seeking that feeling—wanting to feel close to God—we become annoyed by others making noise or by too many people being present. This attitude is selfish and contrary to the nature of the Church. The Church is called to bring people together to glorify God, to live out their faith through self-sacrifice, love, care, and ministry to others. If, instead, we focus on preserving our individual comfort, we are missing the point entirely. This is a surrogate, a fake version of faith, and we must be aware of it.

Religious feelings can also make us unwilling to learn more about our faith. We might fear that gaining deeper knowledge could cause us to lose that comforting feeling. We cling to what feels sincere and authentic, but in doing so, we risk becoming ignorant of what faith truly means. This fear of losing our emotional experience reveals that such feelings are not genuine faith. Additionally, when we rely on these feelings, we often become unwilling to share our faith with others. We want to preserve it for ourselves, thinking, "I have it, and it’s so nice." But the faith Christ gives us compels us to share it with everyone, to spread the fire of faith and inspire others. True faith is about sharing the new life and salvation God has given us, not hoarding it for ourselves. This selfish, inward-focused religious feeling is a distortion of what faith should be.

Another misconception is that faith is about rituals—lighting candles, making the sign of the cross, or performing other external acts. While these practices are meaningful and can strengthen our faith, they are not faith itself. They are meant to make our faith more concrete and real, but if we focus only on the form and neglect the substance, we risk replacing faith with empty ritual. All external practices in the Church should help us grow in faith, but they are not faith in and of themselves.

History provides us with powerful examples of what true faith looks like. During the Plague of Cyprian in the third century, Bishop Dionysios of Alexandria wrote about how Christians responded to the disaster. He described how most Christians showed "unbounded love and loyalty, never sparing themselves and thinking only of one another." They cared for the sick, attended to their needs, and ministered to them in Christ, often becoming infected themselves and dying in the process. Their actions demonstrated the transformative power of faith. In contrast, pagans deserted the sick, fleeing from the danger. This stark difference highlights the essence of true faith: it is selfless, sacrificial, and life-giving. 

Let us strive for this kind of faith—one that moves us to love, serve, and share the life Christ has given us, rather than settling for superficial feelings or empty rituals. True faith changes us and, through us, changes the world.

and fled from their dearest friends. They shunned any participation or fellowship with death, which, despite all their precautions, they could not easily escape. Isn’t this what we see happening today during pandemics? Everyone is so consumed by fear for their own lives that they abandon others, thinking, "It’s not my problem, not my concern. I need to protect myself." People even create theories to justify their actions, claiming, "You need to be merciful to yourself, so everyone should act this way." We see how easily we slip back into this pagan mindset, even while calling ourselves Christians. By the way we live—by our lack of faith and self-sacrifice—we are no different from those pagans. Faith becomes merely a personal checkbox: "I’m a Christian," "I’m a Muslim," or "I’m this or that." But it doesn’t manifest in how we live, how we treat others, or what we do. This is a serious problem.

Christ asked, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?" This question is more relevant than ever. We lack real faith. Let us reflect deeply on this and ask the Lord to change us. Let us pray for the heart, the eagerness, and the strength to be His true followers—not just in word or name, but in how we live, how we treat others, and what we do daily. May the Lord help us and bless us. Amen.
