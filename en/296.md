# Modern Paganism and massive belief in nonsense.

Dear brothers and sisters, we are approaching the Great Lent. It will begin in just about a week, on March 3rd, and during this time, we reflect on the meaning of the Lenten season and where we want to go spiritually. Today, I want to share with you some observations and ideas about modern paganism, how we see it within the Church, and why and how it is related to fasting. You see, as a matter of fact, we can fast in the wrong way and fall into some heresy. 

Take, for example, the great—well, not great, but the outstanding—heretic Arius. He was very skinny, you know, like an ascetic. People believed him because he seemed so virtuous. He was actually super proud and arrogant, but he disguised this under a facade of humility and asceticism. This asceticism attracted many people, but it was based on something else entirely. This is something I want to talk about today.

Recently, I’ve noticed that in post-Christian countries—places that were once Christian and where you can still find the Holy Scripture everywhere, TV programs about Christianity, and even Orthodox churches—there is a great explosion of paganism. People are obsessed with all kinds of New Age religions, yoga, mysticism, astrology—you name it. Every newspaper seems to have an astrology section, as if everyone is looking into it. It’s just crazy. This paganism spreads from the elite to the general public.

Just recently, I visited a large villa—more like a palace—built by an industrialist over a hundred years ago. He had an enormous amount of money and constructed this huge palace. Everywhere in this palace, you can see Kabbalistic elements and symbols, like the inverted pentagram and many other related symbols. The whole place is in Renaissance style, tied up with mythology, alchemy, and all that secret knowledge. It’s all there. And I couldn’t help but wonder: how come people with very good education, who aren’t burdened by the daily hardships of life, are still drawn to this? 

And it’s not just there. If you look at the West—now, really, the whole world, but especially the West, Europe, the United States, Canada—they are filled with Masonic clubs, lodges, and all kinds of societies obsessed with symbolism and mysticism. Regular people love to watch movies about this stuff. Why this obsession? Why is everyone so similar? It’s like tattoos—you might wonder why people get them, trying to be different, but they all end up looking the same. There’s some kind of common spirit among those who enjoy tattoos, or, say, bikers. Different people, but they all speak and look the same. A similar thing happens with people obsessed or influenced by all this occult stuff. They believe in it, and it shapes them in similar ways.

Why is this so similar? This phenomenon is strikingly similar to paganism in China, India, and even among tribes in places like Papua New Guinea. It’s all rooted in the same spirit. Why is this the case? Why does this spirit persist? The truth is, this spirit is penetrating even into so-called Christian sects—Protestantism, Catholicism, and, unfortunately, we can even see traces of it in the Orthodox Church. Today, I want to explore how this spirit infiltrates us, even when we are in the Church and have access to the teachings of the Holy Fathers on how to believe, how to fast, and what is truly happening. How does this occur?

I was amazed when I visited Russia last year. A huge bookstore was packed with mystical literature, showing how deeply people are drawn to it. Even though churches are everywhere, and there are radio programs, TV shows, and magazines about the true faith, people are still captivated by these mystical ideas. Why? Because it’s spiritual, brothers and sisters. It has a spiritual element to it. It’s not enough to simply explain that it’s fake or doesn’t exist—like the idea that gemstones influence you or that stars control your fate. It’s not enough to tell people, “The right faith is in Jesus Christ; just go to church, and your problems will be solved.” No, people are searching for something else. They’re looking for alternative solutions.

This is why, in Old Testament times, the entire nation of Israel slipped into spiritual adultery, worshipping false gods, even though they had the true religion, the true faith, the Scriptures, and the Law—the Torah. Yet, they were still deceived. How does this happen? It’s not enough to simply say, “Oh, this is bad; let’s tell them what’s right.” No, the first step is to change your life. If you don’t change your life, if you don’t learn how to fast properly, if you don’t pray, if you don’t have God in your life, you will seek substitutes. You’ll look for comfort, security, and pleasure in the wrong places. These things are meant to come from God, your loving Father, but instead, you seek them from spiritual harlots.

But it’s not enough to just say this. These tendencies are deeply tied to Gnosticism, which is not just a philosophy but a religious system with its own spirit. While there are different schools and types of Gnosticism, they share common elements. What we see today is the spirit of Gnosticism—or, if you will, the spirit of Cain. What is this spirit? What is Gnosticism? It’s not straightforward, brothers and sisters. It sounds self-contradictory because Gnostics reject matter. If they reject matter, why do they pursue carnal pleasures, possessions, and worldly power? Why do they crave money and control? This seems contradictory, but there’s an explanation.

Gnostics believe that the true God—the God who created this material world—is evil because He created a world filled with suffering and problems. However, they believe there is another, good God who wants to save us. This good God possesses some power, fire, or light, which He gives to certain people. These individuals are “enlightened,” even if they don’t realize it yet. They believe they possess a special knowledge or spark that sets them apart. This is the essence of Gnosticism: a rejection of the material world and a pursuit of secret knowledge or enlightenment, often leading to pride and a sense of superiority. This is the spirit that permeates modern paganism, mysticism, and even some aspects of contemporary Christianity.

So, these people have a specific aim and goal. First and foremost, they believe they are smarter and possess a wisdom that sets them apart from everyone else. They think only they have the right to rule—no democracy. This technocratic vision that is emerging is also Gnostic in nature. They believe there’s no need for democracy because the “enlightened ones” will lead the world to salvation. This salvation, in their view, involves the transformation of this world. They believe this world must be broken, all traditions destroyed, and out of chaos, a new order will emerge. But this order will align with the spirit of Satan—let’s speak frankly about what this is. It’s Satanic. This new order will increasingly reflect that spirit.

Their greatest task is to transform matter because they are dissatisfied with this world. This dissatisfaction fuels their anxiety, their restlessness. This is why Cain was always shaking—God told him he would tremble and wander. This same spirit drives the desire to transform the world, to create a “better” one. This can manifest in different ways: through revolution, where they seek to burn the world and rebuild it; through global war; or even through consumerism. Today, you see this in the constant dissatisfaction with what you have. Your house? It’s already old; you need a bigger, nicer one. Your phone? It’s outdated; you need a new one. This consumerist spirit is also a Gnostic spirit. 

We fall into this spirit as soon as we lose sight of the true God. We become obsessed with where to travel, what kind of medicine to take, or what new thing to acquire. There’s always this underlying pain, this deep dissatisfaction, this frustration. This is why 80% of people today struggle with psychological issues—they are not happy with this world. They are not thankful to the Lord, and they lack the peace that comes from Christ. The devil is deceiving people, and this is why, as Christians, we must be careful. If we say, “This material world is bad, satisfaction is bad, the food we eat during Lent is bad, everything is bad—only the spiritual matters,” we risk falling into heresy. 

Usually, the problem is the opposite: we don’t care about the spiritual at all and become slaves to our desires, serving Mammon. But even when we strive for something spiritual, we can make the mistake of developing a negative attitude toward the created world. Let us ask the Lord to give us wisdom, humility, and eagerness in prayer and ministry. We should seek union with Him, desiring His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. We are created in this world, in these bodies, which are gifts from God. We should not complain about them but only about our own sins. 

May the Lord protect us from all spirits of delusion, from all forms of Gnosticism in this world—about which I also spoke in my last video—and may we help our loved ones escape modern paganism and reach salvation in Christ. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
