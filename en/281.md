# When we lose Christ, we slip into Paganism or Judaism

Dear brothers and sisters, to the Christians of the early church, it was evident that Christians are the life of the world, like the soul to the body, giving life. True Christians are that source of life, meaning, and light that gives purpose to this world. Everything outside of this is like a body without a soul—it is just a corpse, decomposing, incapable of bearing fruit, tasteless, and marked only by the taste of death and filthiness.

This was so evident to the spiritual people of that time that there was no doubt: it is the crucifixion and the life in Christ and for Christ that restores man not only to the perfect state he was in at the time of Adam before the fall but also grants him the grace of being a child of God, united with God. Because Christ Himself is both God and man, by uniting mysteriously with Christ, we mysteriously unite with God Himself. This gives us the source of true life, which is in God, as well as true wisdom and true love.

Unfortunately, this is not so evident today because not many people have a serious spiritual life, let’s put it that way. Simply being baptized and formally belonging to a church or some organization does not automatically make you a child of the kingdom of heaven or a God-bearer—someone who bears God in their heart.

Today, I want to say a few words about what is happening both outside the church, with heretical groups like Catholicism and Protestantism, and within the church itself. We also have this problem, and we need to be aware of these risks. Within each and every Orthodox Christian, this is also happening. To put it in a straightforward context, let’s go back to how it was named by the early Christians.

There is the *Epistle to Diognetus*, which you can read about, and in the epistles of the Apostle Paul, we read that the whole world is divided into pagans or Greeks (as they called them at the time, though it was not a specific nation but rather all pagans, referred to as *Hellenes*), and the Jews. When the Apostle Paul speaks of Jews, he mainly refers to those who did not accept Christ. He would say that whether you are a pagan or a Jew, once you become a member of the church, you are no longer a Jew or a pagan.

We read in 1 Corinthians 1:22-23: *"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness."* What makes us different from Jews or Greeks or pagans is the crucified Christ. The cross means the crucifixion of Christ, so it is not enough to simply place a cross on your wall or wear it around your neck. It is not enough.

We see that the heretical understanding of the cross is fundamentally different from the true and Orthodox understanding of the cross. This is not the topic for today, but just pay attention to this: the difference is not in the shape of the cross, whether it has Jesus on it or not, or how His feet are positioned. The difference lies in the meaning of the cross—not just theologically but also spiritually. What does it mean for the Christian? Because this is where the source of life and salvation lies, which we see is lacking in both Catholic and Protestant groups.

But let’s go one by one. Also, regarding the division of the world into Greeks and Jews, let’s briefly look at Colossians 3:11, which says: *"In Christ there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in all."* So, the main division is still pre-Pentecost: Greeks and Jews.

Very often, even in the Orthodox Church, people come to the church, they see the beautiful iconostasis, the splendor of the church, the wonderful chants, the vestments, the Divine Liturgy—and some people don’t truly understand what it’s all about. They remain stuck in the superficial picture they see, failing to grasp the depth. And where is the depth? All of it points in one direction: to the cross, to the love of Christ who was crucified, and to the willingness to be crucified in the same way, to walk up to Golgotha bearing our own cross with joy and gladness, following our Master. This is what it’s all about.

The problem is that the fallen man—the old self, the mammon, the beast within us, the spirit of Cain, call it what you will—does not want to be crucified. It does not want the cross. It wants to feel at peace without rejecting the world. And this is what it finds in the Protestant and Catholic environments. You can be proud, materialistic, jealous, and selfish, yet still feel a sense of tranquility: “Oh, but I am a Christian. Salvation is guaranteed because I am Catholic, and the Pope takes care of everything,” or “It’s just given automatically because I am already justified—hallelujah, praise the Lord!” This is the deceit that has crept into what were once Christian churches, leading them into heresy. They have lost the true life, light, salvation, and understanding of the cross. They have lost the sacraments, they have lost Christ. People may speak of Him all day, but there is no Christ there. They call someone else by the name of Christ. But this is another topic.

Today, I want to speak about paganism and Judaic heresy, which are creeping into Christianity—or rather, we are falling into one of these two errors. As soon as we lose the bond that unites us with Christ, we will slip into one of these two things. What are these alternatives? If you do not choose Christ as He is—crucified—then you will slip either into paganism or into Judaic heresy.

What happens if you slip into paganism? I’m not talking about idolatry in the sense of worshiping physical idols like Mazu or other deities, but rather falling into all kinds of occultism within the church. You might start believing in magic, become obsessed with visions, healings, supernatural powers, and the like. You might think that certain objects protect you in some mystical way, or that repeating prayers a certain number of times creates a “wall of protection.” These are pagan superstitions. You might also slip into liberalism and ecumenism, which are forms of spiritual idolatry—the idea that everything is fine, everyone is good, every sect or religion has its own merits, and everyone is saved in their own way. You might embrace syncretism, saying, “Yes, yes, we all support the green agenda,” and so on. You might become enamored with activities—building things, organizing picnics, forming musical bands, and other forms of church entertainment. This is what pagans enjoy. Or you might dive into philosophical scholarship, reading countless books and thinking that knowledge alone is everything, without maintaining a living connection with Christ. You might delve into deep theories, researching Heidegger or other philosophers, analyzing their influence, and so on.

On the other hand, if you slip into Judaic heresy, you might become legalistic, focusing on external rituals, rules, and traditions while losing sight of the spirit of Christ. You might prioritize cultural or ethnic identity over the universal call of the Gospel. Both paganism and Judaic heresy are dangers that pull us away from the true cross of Christ.

The key is to remain rooted in the crucified Christ, bearing our own cross with joy and following Him. This is the essence of our faith, the source of true life, and the path to salvation. Let us not be deceived by superficialities or led astray by the errors of paganism or Judaic legalism. Instead, let us cling to the cross, where true life and salvation are found.

Some people slip into fantasies, such as the Catholic movements of Francis of Assisi with their imaginative practices, or Ignatius of Loyola with his meditations and similar practices. Others may fall into charismatic movements, focusing on healings and other such phenomena. These are pagan tendencies, yet those involved may still think of themselves as Christians. 

Another path you might take is that of Judaism. Of course, you will still call yourself a Christian, but in reality, you will be like Judas. What do I mean by that? It usually manifests as formalism, legalism, and an obsession with rituals and formalities. Everything must be done in a specific way, leading to bureaucracy—whether vertical, as in the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, or more constitutional, with voting, rights, quorums, and caucuses, as seen in Protestantism. But all of this is entirely human and worldly, having nothing to do with Christ, His love, or the Holy Spirit. 

In such environments, you will find alienation—alienation between people, with no love, only individuals asserting their rights and privileges. They believe they have a direct connection with God and that this is how they are saved within the structure. There may also be alienation from God, as they do not truly believe in Him. They may resemble the Sadducees, who thought they were religious but were actually materialists. They live materialistic lives, believing in money and power, which is why they are often deeply political. Both Catholics and Protestants fall into this trap—Protestantism being more pagan in nature, while Catholicism leans more toward Judaism, though both are intermixed with paganism. Ultimately, it is all about human concerns, which is why they love psychology and try to solve problems through human means, as they do not trust God. This is alienation from God.

Only in Christ can we find true life. Only by being crucified, by rejecting our own selves, by breaking away from our worldly attachments, and by seeking the kingdom of God above all else can we become children of heaven. As soon as we lose this focus, we will slip into either paganism or Judaism—or both. 

What we must avoid is having a church that looks nice on the outside—beautifully decorated, running smoothly on schedule, with good discipline, proper attire, and punctuality—but lacking love. This is what Christ condemned when He said, "You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men’s bones and everything unclean" (Matthew 23:27). This is what the Jews fell into, and we must guard against it.

May the Lord keep us from this path. May He grant us true love, teach us spiritual life, self-sacrifice, and the willingness to take up our cross and follow Him. May we bear witness to His love in our lives, and may His blessing be with us. 

Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
