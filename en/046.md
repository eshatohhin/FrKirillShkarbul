# What are the real goals and objectives of the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to clarify the purpose of the church and the goals we have as a church and as individual Christians. 

Regarding the purpose of the church, it is easier to discuss because it remains constant. However, the goals vary depending on the time, society, and even individual members of the church. Both aspects are sometimes misunderstood. Some believe the purpose of the church is to make people better, less evil, or less sinful. Others think it is to preserve ancient faith. Still, others suggest the church's purpose is to provide psychological relief, making people feel better despite life's hardships. 

However, these are not the true purpose of the church. The Christian church, as established by Christ, exists to testify and witness Christ to the world, to unite people with God, and thereby bring them true life, making them alive and ushering them into the kingdom of heaven. At the same time, it aims to conquer and eliminate all evil in the world. This is the purpose of the church, which remains unchanged. 

The way the church achieves this purpose—its main goal—can be seen through different tasks. The goal remains the same, but the tasks vary. Christ continually checks whether we are fulfilling this goal. For example, the Jews of His time preserved the faith, but they failed to bring people into union with God, as their hearts were distant. We must remember this goal and avoid formalizing it, though we can formalize certain tasks. 

It is also crucial for new members to understand that upon entering the church, they must set aside their personal goals and tasks, as these become secondary. Like soldiers in an army, their personal ambitions are secondary, especially during wartime. In the church, the spiritual war is ongoing, and members are responsible for understanding and executing their tasks to the best of their ability. 

Unfortunately, many who join the church, and even some long-standing members, are unclear about the church's goals and tasks. We have discussed the goals, but the tasks differ depending on the context. For instance, during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, the tasks were vastly different from those in the post-Constantine era when the church became predominant. Similarly, the tasks varied in places like Persia, which remained largely non-Christian. Today, the tasks differ in traditionally Orthodox countries like Russia, in the collective West with its post-Christian, postmodern societies, and in other regions with non-Orthodox Christian backgrounds. 

In summary, while the church's purpose remains constant, its tasks adapt to the needs of different times and societies. It is essential for all members to understand and align themselves with these goals and tasks to fulfill the church's mission effectively.

The tasks of the church vary significantly across different regions and societies. In places like Taiwan, Middle Eastern countries, or communist nations, the challenges and responsibilities differ from those in other parts of the world. It is essential to recognize and be mindful of these differences. Additionally, the tasks of priests, laypeople, and monks are distinct, each contributing uniquely to the church's mission. While I cannot outline specific tasks for every individual or group, I can provide a general overview.

In the past, such as during the ancient Roman Empire or in pagan or barbarian societies, the church's primary task was to proclaim the truth. This involved teaching people about the true faith, emphasizing the existence of one God rather than many. At that time, people were often uneducated and more receptive to what they heard, especially when they witnessed the transformative lives of Christians. Seeing and hearing about this different way of life led many to believe and embrace Christianity.

In contrast, today's world is vastly different. Most people consider themselves highly educated, often holding degrees, and are exposed to a multitude of views and philosophies. Many are skeptical and demand proof, even from the media, which they often distrust. Direct testimony or simple declarations of truth are no longer as effective. Instead, the church's tasks now revolve around sharing our love for Christ and helping others come to love Him as well. 

For example, if you love classical music and want others to appreciate it, you cannot simply dismiss their preference for rock and roll by declaring it inferior. Instead, you must help them experience the beauty and value of classical music, showing how it enriches your life. Over time, their hearts may open to what you love, even if they do not immediately agree. Similarly, our task with Christ is to help others feel His love and goodness, allowing their hearts to open to Him gradually.

To achieve this, we must first love Christ deeply ourselves. This requires a solid spiritual foundation, built through prayer, participation in the Divine Liturgy and Eucharist, fasting, and living according to Christ's commandments. By reading the Gospels and allowing His words to transform us, we establish the spiritual basis necessary to fulfill our mission. Without this foundation, our efforts will lack the necessary strength and authenticity.

Christ commanded us to "go and teach all nations, baptizing them" (Matthew 28:19). He did not merely instruct us to live good lives or acquire knowledge; He called us to take up our cross, follow Him, and be His witnesses everywhere. This is our spiritual task. We must approach it with dedication, ensuring that our actions and words reflect our love for Christ and our commitment to His mission. Only then can we effectively share His love with the world and fulfill the church's purpose.

It is a common misconception to think that when we come to church, our focus should be solely on spirituality—on mystical, intangible things that seem disconnected from our everyday lives. We might say, "Now it's all about spiritual life, about God's grace, and things I cannot see," while treating our material life as a separate world where we continue as we always have. This is a significant mistake. Spiritual life is not detached from the material world; rather, it encompasses it. 

The material world—our physical lives, relationships, work, and even the use of physical objects and money—is deeply intertwined with spirituality. Spiritual things are accomplished within this material world. We cannot compartmentalize our lives, separating the spiritual from the physical. This division is reminiscent of the ancient heresy of Monophysitism, which, in a way, suggested that only spiritual things belong to the church, creating a false dichotomy between the spiritual and the material. 

Instead, we must remember that our spiritual life includes our daily responsibilities in our families, jobs, and communities. As soldiers of Christ in His great army, we are called to fulfill specific tasks in these areas. Every action we take, every decision we make, and every interaction we have is an opportunity to live out our faith and accomplish the tasks Christ has given us. 

Let us reflect on what our tasks are in our families, workplaces, and communities. How can we, as followers of Christ, bring His love and truth into these areas? How can we serve as His instruments in this world? May the Lord bless us, strengthen us, and empower us to fulfill these tasks daily. Let us not rely on our own strength but on His, so that we may love Him more than anything else and share this love with everyone around us. 

God bless.
