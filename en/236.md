# Christ is Born but men choose to serve Baal

Dear brothers and sisters, the 40 days of Advent are almost over, and we are entering into the mystery of Christmas, the Nativity of Christ. The last five days of the Christmas Lent are especially strict because we need to focus very deeply on the meaning and the spirit of the Lord's coming. For us to resonate, to be of one mind with the Lord, and to be able to receive this mystery, we need to exert great spiritual effort. It is not enough just to switch on famous Christmas music, put up some decorations, buy presents for others, say "Merry Christmas" or "Season's Greetings," and assume everyone is happy, everything is fine, and we can celebrate. This is profanation. We need to think really deeply, and not just think—we need to pray and strive to gain this spirit.

Today, I want to share my recent thoughts on the spirit of the Lord's coming because the whole world, including us, is still so far from embodying this spirit. First, let us consider the news of the Lord's coming. Only two people knew what was happening. The first was Mary, who received this news from the angel and concealed it from everyone for her entire life, at least until the resurrection of Christ. She did not proclaim that He was the Messiah or that His conception was immaculate. She kept this secret, at least until the time of His public ministry. If she had revealed it earlier, people would not have believed her; they might have stoned her, as no one would have accepted that this was from the Holy Spirit. The other person was Joseph, who was also righteous and pious. The angel came to him several times, and he, too, concealed this news. From the very beginning, the coming of the Lord is a great mystery. The Lord Himself conceals this mystery from everyone, and we need to ponder deeply why He does this and what He is avoiding. We will discover that He is avoiding the spirit of the prince of this world—the spirit of the Antichrist, the spirit of Mammon.

The Lord could have become the king of the universe in a material sense. He could have wielded all the power imaginable. He could have destroyed all His enemies instantly, causing them to perish in a moment. He could have possessed all resources, for He created the entire universe. He has all knowledge, all science, all wisdom. He could have had all the oil, gold, diamonds, and everything else—He could have used it all. He came into this world with a mission, equipped with the most intelligent political system, controlling everything so that everyone would worship Him as the ruler, the king, with no one able to oppose Him. Yet, He chose not to do this. Let us reflect deeply on why.

This was, in fact, the temptation of the devil. The devil told Him, "I can give you power over all the kingdoms of the world—you see their glory. You can have all of it, but you must bow to me." We see that this issue of power and influence is tied to the devil, and the mystery of the Lord's hiddenness, His humility, is connected to His battle against the devil. All the examples I will share, beginning with the news of His birth, point to this truth.

Another example: He was born in Bethlehem, but His family traveled from Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem for His birth. After His birth, they had to flee to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath, and later they returned to Galilee. Thus, no one knew He was born in Bethlehem except Mary and Joseph. This is why He was called "Jesus of Nazareth," and to this day, Jews refer to Christians as "Nazarenes." They refuse to accept Him as the Christ, which is why they do not use the term "Christian" but instead say "Nazarene" in Hebrew. This hatred, this refusal to accept Him, persists even now.

And this is why we have "Caesar's greetings" and "Xmas" instead of "Christmas"—to celebrate some vague "X," this nonsense. There is still enmity against Christ; even His name incites hostility. This was the case back then, when He came, and He did not let anyone know. Even the scribes, the learned men, and the high priests did not know He was born in Bethlehem. He made it so difficult to uncover this truth that even for them, it remained a mystery. This is why they said, "No, you do not fit, because the Messiah is supposed to be from Bethlehem, and you are from Galilee, from Nazareth." We see that the Lord, seemingly on purpose, concealed everything related to His identity as the Messiah—even from those scribes and leaders who could guide the people of Israel. He hid it even from them.

Then we see the star of Bethlehem, which appeared only to the Magi. They understood its significance, but no one else did. This is why they came to Jerusalem and told Herod about the star. Herod, unaware of its meaning, summoned the scribes and learned men to ask where the Messiah was supposed to be born. They told him, "In Bethlehem." Herod, knowing this, sought to kill the Messiah. How absurd is that? They recognized that the Messiah, the salvation from the Lord, was to be born in Bethlehem, as foretold in Scripture, yet Herod's response was to destroy Him. How foolish! We see here the depth of hatred, the lust for power and control. Herod refused to surrender to God, declaring, "I am God; what else do you want?" He claimed to worship the God of Abraham and Jacob, building grand temples and praying piously, yet when the Lord Himself came, Herod sought to destroy Him without mercy. He sent his most ruthless troops to slaughter 14,000 innocent babies. This reveals how the spirit of this world hates the Lord, righteousness, and humility, craving instead power and control. But the Lord says, "You want power? Have it. I don't care," and He flees to Egypt. Such humility! Do we possess such humility? He could have destroyed Herod in an instant—Herod could have eaten a sandwich and dropped dead. But instead, the Lord chose to flee.

When He was born, His family arrived in Bethlehem, but there was no room in any inn. He was born in a barn—a dirty, smelly place filled with animals and filth. It was dark, cold, and uncomfortable. Today, we see nativity scenes depicted as peaceful and harmonious, with beautiful decorations, but it was not like that. Imagine arriving in a town with no place to stay—you would end up in some dump, under a bridge, or in a hole, somewhere dirty and unpleasant. That was the kind of place where the Lord was born. He did not choose a glorious location. He was born to simple people, descendants of King David's noble lineage, but by then, they were peasants—ordinary, humble folk. He could have been born to the emperor of Rome or China, with all the power and glory at His disposal, and countless people would have come to honor Him. But that was not His way. I think you already know these things, but it is important to reflect on them deeply.

Then, when they return from Egypt, they settle in Nazareth, where no one knows what happened in Bethlehem. No one knows about the Magi, the shepherds, or the angels—only Mary and Joseph are aware. Jesus grows up as a simple child, experiencing hard toil and poverty. He knows what it means to work hard every day, to live without special respect, and even to endure insults. People often questioned His legitimacy, saying, "Isn't this the son of Mary?" In those days, it was unusual to refer to someone as the son of their mother; it was customary to say, "son of your father." By calling Him "son of Mary," they implied doubt about Joseph being His father, suggesting He might be a bastard. Imagine the humiliation: the King of the Universe, the Messiah, the Word of God, one of the Holy Trinity, enduring such scorn without retaliation. This reveals His profound humility. He bore all this humiliation silently, and at the end of His life, He endured the ultimate humiliation and torture—betrayal, slander, and a brutal death. Let us reflect deeply on what this teaches us. How must we change? How does this challenge the way we act, think, and treat others? This must dismantle our old self, which craves vainglory—our desire for praise, resources, security, a stable job, a nice house, and personal enjoyment. Let us be honest with ourselves: this is who we are. The Lord dismantles all of this, saying, "If you want to be My disciple, take up your cross, deny yourself, and follow Me. Only then will you gain true life." Unless we do this, we will not be counted among those who receive Christ, who open their hearts to Him, who trust in His miracles, including His virgin birth. Many today call themselves Christians but reduce faith to the Bible alone, dismissing the miracles of the Church as fake, claiming saints are impossible, and insisting everyone is a sinner. This is the spirit of the antichrist—a refusal to believe in the Lord's almighty power. No matter what we call ourselves, without humility, without surrendering our will to the Lord and allowing Him to transform us from within, giving us a new mind and a new way of life—being reborn of the Holy Spirit—nothing will help. Our old self will persist until it dies meaningless before the Lord. May the Lord grant us such eagerness and faith, teaching us true humility and guiding us through the delusions of this world, so that we may truly participate in the mystery of Christ's holy Nativity. May the Lord be with you. Merry Christmas, dear brothers and sisters. God bless you.
