# Why flowers are blooming, and how is it related to our Faith

Dear friends, today I feel like talking about a simpler topic. We've discussed many serious matters, but something like the blooming of flowers can bring us a lot of insights and inspiration for our spiritual life. Why do we have flowers blooming? Today, for the first time, a bush in front of our church bloomed with beautiful purple flowers. Why does this happen? How do we use flowers? We give them as presents to our loved ones, decorate our homes or other places for special events, birthdays, anniversaries, or public celebrations. We also see many flowers on the streets and plazas, which give us a special feeling of celebration. It tells us that today is a special day, a day of blooming joy, a day of festivity. This reminds us that the world created by God is blooming and glorifying Him. There is an ongoing celebration.

At least here in Taiwan, and in many countries in the southern regions, we always see flowers blooming. There is no winter. This ongoing celebration is inherent in the world, and it should be like that in the heart of every one of us, continuously and always. It used to be like that in paradise. When we see flowers, they remind us of life in paradise, of that celebration when people were together with God, in constant communication with the Lord. Unfortunately, this was lost, and if we are honest with ourselves, we don't have that celebration going on most of the time. We are concerned with many things, many problems. We lack funds, or we are planning to buy something—a car, a house, or something else. We are always struggling to make enough money to pay the bills. We have all kinds of issues—family problems, conflicts with friends, colleagues, and many other people. Even when there aren't many problems, our hearts are still empty and unhappy. This is the outcome of losing paradise, losing our union with God, and losing the health that is inherent to our soul.

This happened so that we could understand that after being placed outside of paradise, all the tough life, the toil, and the many sufferings we endure have a meaning: to teach us that without God, there is no happiness, no joy, and no salvation. Only Christ can heal our hearts and bring paradise back to us—not just the earthly paradise, but the kingdom of heaven. We need to understand this not only with our minds but also feel it with our hearts. Once we feel it and begin to crave Him—not some substitute or surrogate for happiness or pleasure—but the Lord Himself, that is when He can grant us salvation, joy, health, and freedom. This is not something we can achieve on our own. It's not something we can simply decide to have or obtain through psychological self-training or positive thinking. Modern psychology may teach that you can solve your problems yourself or with the help of relatives and people around you, but this is not true. Only God can do this. Everything else is a substitute, a surrogate. And what is the substitute for Christ? We know it is called the Antichrist. So, we are searching and seeking genuine salvation and healing that comes from the Lord Himself. This is what we are truly seeking.

And the flowers, when they bloom, when you see them bloom, they should remind us of the beauty we have lost, the celebration we are meant to have. Just as nature celebrates through these flowers, we too should celebrate continuously in our hearts. We should carry that joy within us always. Let us ask for this healing to come from the Lord, for this joy to fill us, so that we may be united with Him, walking alongside Him, and fulfilling all the plans He has for us. May our hearts not only bloom but also bear the fruits of our faith. May the Lord help us and bless us. Amen.
