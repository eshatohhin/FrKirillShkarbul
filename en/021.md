# Globalization and “union above”

Dear friends, today we will talk about globalization and how a Christian faces these matters.  
With globalization, we have convenient transport and information technologies that allow us to communicate with people around the globe in different languages. There is a lot of convenience coming from this trend.  

This trend will continue despite the pandemic. It may seem that the pandemic is damaging globalization, but in fact, it is not. In fact, it will make globalization happen even faster. When there is a big danger, people unite, and there will be methods and government programs across the globe. There might even be a world government to deal with problems like this at some point, perhaps in the future. There are already talks about it.  

So, this actually accelerates globalization, even though some people argue about the rise of nation-states and similar issues. In any case, the world will eventually become more and more globalized, more united. We know from the Book of Revelation that in the last days, the world will be united under one government, and we know what kind of government it will be—anti-Christian.  

But the matter I want to discuss today is not about that. The matter is how we, as Christians, can use this globalized world, these globalizing technologies, and all that comes with it to witness our faith. How do we treat this phenomenon?  

There are two concepts we need to understand very well.  
The first concept is a union above—a union between people in God, achieved by seeking God and seeking truth. This is the union that Christ prayed for when He prayed that His disciples would be united. During the Divine Liturgy, we pray that the Lord may unite everyone, for the unity of all people in the world and the unity of all creation in God. There is nothing wrong with this.  

However, what is happening now in a spiritual sense can be called a union below, and this is the exact opposite. When we talk about union, we need to be aware that the devil can steal this word and use it to denote something entirely opposite, something hostile to the original meaning.  

The original union—the true and fundamental union of human hearts in God and in truth—is replaced by another idea. What is this other idea? It is the idea that we don’t care about anything spiritual. We care only for convenience, pleasure, and helping each other—but why? For money. This is the union of Babylon, a prototype of this kind of union, where everyone is driven by money, pleasure, and selfishness.  

This creates something that looks like union, but in reality, people remain enemies of each other. Why? Because they have to sacrifice the union above for the sake of the union below. These two cannot coexist.  

If we emphasize the union below—ecumenism is a good example—people are called not to care about religion or what they believe. They are told to just be together, embrace everyone, tolerate everything, eat pizza together, chant songs together, and not care about any fundamental religious aspects. They are told not to care about God. This is a very big problem.  

We know that in a family, we hope for a husband and wife to have a spiritual union of their hearts, not just a physiological union or a partnership of convenience. A family is not a company or a business enterprise where everyone derives some benefit in a win-win situation. We hope that in a family, people are united spiritually, becoming one heart and one mind.  

The big risk is that people will be united not by God but by mammon. This is what we have talked about before.

And this danger is very significant because, with all the benefits and economic growth we have today, people are becoming more and more immersed in the flesh—living for comfort, pleasure, earning, and spending money. They no longer ask fundamental questions. This is why we need to wake up.  

Every day, we must ask ourselves: Where am I going? What is the purpose of my life? Am I on the right path? Am I following Christ? Am I doing what He wants? Am I seeking truth? Or am I just running through life aimlessly, only to reach the end and realize it’s over?  

This world has become like a big railway station or a shopping mall. People are running around, consumed by noise and distractions. Everyone is preoccupied with how to spend money, thinking about prices, products, and the utility they can gain for themselves. It’s all about selfish interests.  

Shopping centers and malls are not places for mission work. People there are not thinking about God; they are focused solely on what they can get for themselves. This mindset leaves no room for a higher union. While there may be a superficial unity—like shared services such as sewage systems—it doesn’t truly unite people.  

We must strive for the union above, in God, not the union below. This is why each of us needs to wake up daily and reflect on our spiritual journey. Only then can we use the benefits of globalization and technology to share the spirit of Christ, to testify, and to witness about Him. This will bring us great spiritual success, and the mighty hand of God will be with us. This is incredibly important.  

This is how we should approach the globalizing world we live in. May God help each of us on this path and grant us His blessing. Amen.
