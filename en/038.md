# Devil’s roulette. How it works

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about the devil and his methods. We don't often talk about him because our focus is on preaching Christ and His love. However, the devil is mentioned frequently in the Gospels and other books of the Holy Scripture. We read that he is the ancient serpent who tempts people, deceives them, and even leads entire nations astray. The Apostle Paul also warns us that we should be aware of the devil's schemes. As Christians, it is crucial for us to understand how he operates and what his methods are.

In the Lord's Prayer, we are taught to pray, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." Christ instructs us to pray that we may not fall into temptation and that we may be delivered from the devil. This is of great importance. Today, many people dismiss the existence of the devil and demons, attributing such things to psychology. However, this is a dangerous mindset because if we do not recognize our enemy, he will prevail. Therefore, we must be aware of him. We should not fear him excessively or become obsessed with him, but we must be knowledgeable and vigilant.

What I want to discuss today is what I call "the devil's roulette." Why do I call it roulette? Because, like in the game of roulette, what appears to be a win can quickly turn into a loss. The line between winning everything and losing everything is very thin, and often the outcome is the opposite of what we expect. This is why I refer to it as the devil's roulette. Something that seems right and good may, in fact, be wrong and harmful, leading to great loss.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a family and a spouse whom you love. Someone might tell you, "You should love others too; you cannot hate people. You must love everyone." So, you go and form relationships with other women, believing this to be an expression of love. However, we know that this is adultery and fornication. By doing this, you destroy the true love between you and your spouse, commit a mortal sin, and bring harm to your soul and life. You become corrupted and lose everything. Yet, it seems like an act of love, not hatred. This is how the devil works—something that appears good and beneficial is, in reality, the opposite, coming from the devil and leading to destruction.

Another example is liberalism. People often chant "freedom, freedom," but if you disagree with certain ideas promoted under the banner of liberalism, you may be marginalized or even imprisoned. For instance, the push for human rights can lead to the legalization of practices that undermine the traditional concept of family. Even though the majority believe that a family consists of a man and a woman, their views are dismissed as wrong. A small group imposes their beliefs on everyone, ignoring the rights of the majority. What seems like freedom and human rights ultimately leads to fascism, totalitarian control, and censorship.

Another example is ecumenism. The idea is that we should love all religions and be tolerant. However, this can lead to betraying your own faith. You may be called to pray with everyone, to unite in all things, and to accept that there are many ways to salvation, not just one Savior. This is another way the devil deceives us—by making us believe that all paths lead to God, when in truth, there is only one way, through Jesus Christ.

In conclusion, we must be vigilant and discerning, recognizing the devil's tactics and standing firm in our faith. Let us not be deceived by what appears to be good but is, in reality, a trap set by the enemy. May we always seek the truth and remain steadfast in Christ.

So you betray your own faith in Christ, and eventually, you betray the body of Christ, which is the Church He established. Your understanding becomes blurred, and you are led astray. What appears to be love and tolerance is, in reality, a betrayal of Christ and contrary to true love. It seems like love, but it is not.

Similarly, in raising a child, you are often told to give them as much freedom, as many candies, and as much of whatever they desire. You are told to love them by indulging their every whim. However, this spoils the child and is not true love—it is harmful. True love involves setting boundaries and guiding the child to overcome harmful vices. A child must learn to obey elders, to avoid selfishness, and to grow in virtue. What seems like love can, in fact, be detrimental to their development.

We also see this in the consumerist society we live in today. Stores are filled with goods, and the world appears wealthy. Yet, this consumerist mindset creates the greatest scarcity. People feel the need to constantly acquire more—new phones, updated gadgets, and the latest trends—to maintain their households and keep up with societal expectations. As a result, many struggle financially, fear losing their jobs, and feel pressured to take on any work available. This creates a form of economic slavery, placing immense stress on individuals. What seems like abundance and prosperity is, in reality, a source of great pressure and scarcity.

Furthermore, we hear calls for unity and globalization, which can be positive if rooted in genuine human connection. However, when unity is based on materialistic values—where others are seen only as sources of benefit or harm—it leads to a shallow and fragmented society. This is reminiscent of the Tower of Babel, where people sought to unite for their own glory but ended in division and confusion. In modern society, despite globalization, people are becoming more isolated, fearful of genuine connection, and focused solely on transactional relationships. The mindset of "it's just business, nothing personal" prevails, further separating individuals. What appears to be unity is, in fact, division.

Let us be mindful of this: the devil often cannot present outright evil because most people would reject it. Instead, he wraps his deceptions in attractive packages, making them seem good and desirable. This is how he ensnares us. This is why we pray, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." We ask the Lord to help us discern what is truly from Him and what is a trap set by the devil—a deception that leads to misery, suffering, and eternal death.

May the Lord bless each of you and grant you the wisdom to distinguish between what is of God and what is a deception of the enemy. Amen.
