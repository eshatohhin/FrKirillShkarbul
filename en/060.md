# Why God is Mysterious

Dear friends,

Today is a windy day, but we are still going ahead with our videos. Today's topic is "God as a Mystery." Very often, we think that we can know everything about God and that we already know everything about Him. This is a risky mindset because when we believe we know everything about someone—be it our spouse, a teacher, or anyone else—we tend to lose interest. Similarly, when we think we already know everything a teacher has to say, we stop being able to learn from them.

This principle also applies to the development of science. Science operates on the assumption that there is so much out there that we don't know, which is why we continue to conduct research. Science never claims to know everything; most scientific theories, like the theory of relativity, are not considered final. This openness allows science to keep developing. The more it discovers, the more it realizes how much is still unknown. The frontier of science is always expanding.

In the same way, our understanding of God must continually expand. We should remember that the development of civilization, particularly in ancient Greece, was marked by the attitude of Socrates, who said, "I know that I don't know anything." In Christianity, this is referred to as humility and a "poor in spirit" attitude. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they are open to receiving more. If we think we already know everything, we close ourselves off to further understanding. True humility allows the Lord to give us more and more. If we are already filled with our own knowledge and conclusions, there is no room for anything new to come in.

Today, I want to discuss God as a mystery. In the Western theological tradition, particularly after the Middle Ages, theology was heavily influenced by scholasticism. Scholasticism is an approach that uses logic and knowledge to understand God—His nature, properties, and so on. It aims to develop a clear, analytical theory of God, much like a scientific theory. This approach has its roots in Spain, where, from the 8th century onwards, there was a strong emphasis on analysis, influenced by Arab scholars who taught Aristotle and other analytical methods.

However, over-analyzing something can lead to a loss of love for the object being analyzed. For example, if you analyze your spouse or your teacher to the point where you think you understand everything about them, you may lose interest and love for them. This over-analysis led to a crisis in the Western world, where people felt they had described God fully and thus lost interest in Him. This resulted in a decline in religious life, with attempts to revive it through emotional means, such as the Franciscan emphasis on compassion.

In contrast, the Orthodox Church has always understood God as a mystery. This recognition keeps the sense of wonder and humility alive, preventing the stagnation that comes from thinking we have fully comprehended the divine.

In Hebrew, the concept of mystery is referred to as *sod*. This term signifies the deep, hidden wisdom within the Torah, the law of God. To truly understand this mystery, we must be united with it. This idea is echoed in the Gospel of Mark, chapter four, where Jesus teaches the crowds in parables but explains the deeper meanings only to His disciples. This is not discrimination but an acknowledgment that only those who follow Him and internalize His teachings can grasp and apply this wisdom in their lives. Similarly, we can only understand the true law and wisdom of God by following Him and living according to His commandments. As we draw closer to Him, He reveals Himself to us more fully.

It is not enough to have external knowledge about God, as some scholars or theologians might claim. For instance, someone might say, "I've read everything about Christianity, studied the Bible multiple times, and know all the commentaries, but I am not a Christian." While such knowledge might be impressive, it remains external and lacks the transformative power of faith. True faith involves a personal relationship with God, allowing Him to reveal the kingdom of heaven to us. In science, knowledge helps us uncover the mysteries of the physical world, but in faith, it is our lived experience and transformation that open the door to deeper understanding of God.

Faith is not merely about belief; it is about allowing that belief to change our lives. This is the key to knowing God more intimately. However, this should not be confused with occultism or esoteric practices, such as astrology, spells, or mystical knowledge from sources like Kabbalah or Tibetan teachings. These practices, which promise superpowers or secret knowledge, are contrary to God's will. They are rooted in evil powers and lead us away from humility and Christian virtues. Instead of seeking to be like God through such means, we must seek Him through faith, humility, and obedience.

Many people come to faith after exploring these esoteric paths. They may start by reading occult books or engaging in mystical practices, but eventually, they realize the emptiness and danger of such pursuits. Through repentance, they turn to the true God, abandoning these practices and beginning a genuine spiritual journey. Let us pray for the wisdom to avoid atheism, the arrogance of thinking we know everything, and the temptation of demonic practices. True strength and power come only from God, and we receive them through humility, living according to the Gospel, and allowing His grace to transform us. May the Lord grant us the strength to resist all forms of evil and grow in faith, inheriting His kingdom and standing firm against any demonic influence.

Amen. May the Lord grant us His wisdom, guide us on this path, and protect us from any mistakes or wrong directions. May He shield us from harmful practices and lead us ever closer to Him. God bless.
