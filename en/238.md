# Manifestation of God vs. Manifestations of Darkness

To you, brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated Christmas, and the celebration will continue until January 13, lasting for seven days. Soon after that, on January 19, we celebrate the baptism of Christ, also known as Epiphany. Today, I want to share some insights about the meaning of the Lord's coming. During these holy days of celebration, we reflect deeply on what it signifies.

One important insight comes from the fact that, in the past, these two feasts were celebrated together. In the earliest times, it was just Epiphany that was significant—the baptism of Christ and the coming of the Holy Trinity, which was made manifest to the world and to the faithful. Initially, this manifestation was revealed to John the Baptist. This revelation of the Lord was later celebrated alongside Christmas, marking both the coming of the Lord and His manifestation, or Epiphany, if you will. Over time, these celebrations were separated by several days, so now we first observe Christmas and then Epiphany.

This separation provides us with a crucial insight into the meaning of Christmas and the nativity of Christ. The term "Epiphany" in Greek, "Epiphania," derives from the root "phano," meaning "to show." Thus, phenomena—things that are shown or revealed—are central to this concept. Epiphany, therefore, signifies the manifestation or revelation of the Lord to the people.

Before Christ, humanity lived in a world where the Lord was hidden. After Adam and Eve were exiled from Paradise, they were distanced from the Lord due to their disobedience and choice to live independently. This separation was a consequence of their sin, not because the Lord desired their expulsion. As a result, the Lord became hidden, no longer directly perceived by humanity. Communication with Him became more difficult; Adam could no longer converse with Him as before. This led subsequent generations into idolatry, worshiping various entities, and losing the memory of the one Supreme God. Although remnants of this knowledge persisted in places like India and were preserved by patriarchs like Abraham, the majority of people lost the concept entirely.

Even for the chosen nation of Israel, the Lord remained hidden. They were in exile, and so was He, creating a profound separation. This exile was both physical and spiritual, as seen when the Israelites were exiled to Babylon due to their disobedience. The destruction of the temple further emphasized this separation, especially after they rejected Christ. This separation from the Lord resulted in a dual exile—of humanity and of the Lord Himself. The Lord was not manifest; He was not open for direct communication, let alone union. Thus, the expectation of the Lord's coming was the anticipation of His manifestation.

I recently spoke with a Rabbi who adheres to Judaism, and he shared that they are still awaiting another Messiah, whom we believe to be the Antichrist. They live with the understanding that God is in exile, even though the state of Israel exists. They believe that since the Messiah has not yet come, they remain in exile, and God is also in exile. This mirrors the state of humanity before Christ's coming—the Lord was in exile, hidden, and seemingly absent. The coming of the Lord changed everything.

The Lord's coming grants us the ability to see Him directly, for He said, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." However, the crucial point is that this requires faith, love, and free will. This is why He remains hidden—He makes Himself discoverable to all, but only those who seek Him with faith, love, and a genuine desire for truth will find Him in Jesus Christ.

Yet, there is another kind of manifestation in the world. Anyone seeking power or influence must, in some way, manifest themselves to the world. This is achieved through various means—political rallies, television, show business, and other forms of public display. These manifestations often create idols, attempting to replace the true manifestation of the Lord and His truth. This phenomenon is not new; it dates back long before Christ. For example, in the 2nd century BC, King Antiochus Epiphanes, also known as Antiochus IV, persecuted the Maccabees. The name "Epiphanes" shares the same root as "Epiphany," meaning "manifestation." Antiochus declared himself a god, demanding worship, and desecrated the Jewish temple by placing idols within it. This led to the Maccabean revolt, during which many were martyred. Antiochus Epiphanes can be seen as a precursor or prefiguration of the Antichrist.

Throughout history, other figures have exhibited similar traits—those who seek to manifest themselves as saviors, using charisma, propaganda, and even false miracles to persuade people that they are the source of all good. Leaders like Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler presented themselves as saviors, with their images displayed like gods on flags and posters. This is idolatry, as they were portrayed as the ultimate hope and light for humanity. Today, this trend continues in different forms, such as show business, where celebrities like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Lady Gaga are idolized by millions. These figures, often referred to as "idols," draw people away from the truth, replacing the Lord in their hearts with empty distractions.

This anti-Christian nature is pervasive in modern culture, from entertainment to politics and marketing. It subtly reshapes minds and souls, preparing the way for the ultimate deception. For instance, young girls who watch cartoons about princesses or other media may adopt distorted values, leading to lifestyles marked by tattoos and chaos. These influences reshape their entire mentality, binding them to the idols they unknowingly worship.

We must remain vigilant, recognizing the origins and dangers of these false manifestations. The key difference between the true manifestation of the Lord and these counterfeit ones lies in the requirement of faith. The Lord does not force Himself upon us; He invites us to seek Him with a sincere heart. In contrast, the false manifestations of the world seek to dominate and deceive, drawing people away from the truth. As we navigate this world, we must guard our hearts and minds, ensuring that Christ remains at the center of our lives, not the idols of this age.

The Lord reveals Himself to those who believe in Him, who earnestly seek truth and righteousness, who are pious and love the true God. To such people, He uncovers this divine mystery, allowing them to see Him. Through holy icons, we can perceive the Lord, and with our spiritual eyes, we can even glimpse God the Father. This revelation is a gift granted to us, marking the new era in which the Lord manifests Himself to humanity.

However, the forces of darkness strive to obscure this revelation, spreading as much confusion and distraction as possible to prevent people from seeing the truth. They aim to replace the light of Christ with their own deceptions, drawing people away from the divine manifestation. In contrast, when we behold the Lord's glory, we are called to magnify and share it with the world. This is why, on Christmas Eve, we hold processions of the cross—a visible expression of the Church, as the bride of Christ, bringing the joy and glory of the Lord's nativity to the world. As the Lord said, "You will be my witnesses," we are tasked with manifesting His glory to all until the end of time.

Yet, there is a danger when faith and love for the Lord are absent, even as we outwardly perform acts of worship. If we engage in processions, liturgical decorations, and other religious practices without genuine devotion, our hearts may belong to Mammon rather than to God. In such cases, we risk becoming like the Pharisees, whom the Lord criticized for appearing righteous on the outside while harboring corruption within. He likened them to whitewashed tombs—beautiful on the outside but filled with filth and decay. Let us not fall into this hypocrisy. Instead, may the joy of the Lord fill our hearts, and may His manifestation be evident in our lives every day.

This is the message I wished to share with you during this Christmas season. May the Lord be with you, and may His divine manifestation dwell in your hearts throughout this new year. We are truly blessed. Amen.
