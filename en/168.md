# Mission to Polynesia has begun

Dear brothers and sisters, I am now on a mission to French Polynesia. I am currently on the island of Tahiti, and behind me is the island of Mo'orea. The scenery here is very beautiful, with birds all around. There has been no mission here in the past, so I hope this blessed land can also have Orthodox Christians. Please pray for this, pray for me, and for this mission. Here in the middle of the Pacific, there is still land that needs the word of God. I hope it will bear fruit. God bless everyone.
