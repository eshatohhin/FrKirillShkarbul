# How can Chinese New Year become a Christian holiday

Dear brothers and sisters, today the world, particularly the Chinese world, celebrates the Chinese New Year. I am currently in Taiwan, where almost all shops are closed, and people are celebrating. Families gather at home, and the festivities last for at least one week, sometimes even two. This is a significant event, especially as Chinese communities continue to grow globally.

For Christians, particularly Chinese Christians—whether from Taiwan, Hong Kong, or anywhere else where Chinese is spoken—what does this feast mean, and how can it be celebrated? For those unfamiliar with Chinese culture, this can serve as a practical missionary opportunity, a way to engage with and understand the traditions of others. This approach has been practiced in the Church for centuries, where pagan feasts and social traditions were "baptized," preserving their forms but infusing them with Christian meaning.

Let’s consider the Chinese New Year. Its origins trace back to the Warring States period, around 300-400 BC. During this time, a ritual called Dan-no was performed to chase away illness on the last day of the lunar year. This tradition spread as the Qing kingdom rose to power, eventually becoming a nationwide celebration. The Chinese New Year marks the arrival of spring, a time for seeking blessings and good fortune for the new lunar year. It is deeply tied to the agricultural cycle, as spring signifies the planting season and new growth.

In the Christian tradition, we have Pascha (Easter), the greatest feast, which also coincides with the beginning of spring. The month of Nisan, roughly corresponding to March, was considered the start of the new year in ancient times. Pascha celebrates the resurrection of Christ, the return of true life. Thus, there is a parallel between the themes of renewal and life in both traditions.

While we cannot simply replace the Chinese New Year with Pascha, we can draw connections between the two. For those seeking an equivalent in Chinese culture to the Christian celebration of Pascha, Easter serves as a meaningful parallel. However, we do not propose celebrating Pascha during the Chinese New Year, as the timing and traditions are distinct. Instead, we can appreciate the shared themes of renewal and life, finding ways to honor both traditions respectfully.

So, what can we propose and do during this time? We can use the Chinese New Year as an opportunity to express gratitude to God for the past year and to seek His blessings for the year ahead. We can hold prayer services, such as a Molieben, even if we are at home with our families, as many Chinese people are during this time. We can pray individually and collectively, giving thanks to the Lord. However, this is not the only way to approach this celebration.

As I mentioned earlier, the Chinese New Year is deeply connected to agriculture and the lunar calendar. While it does not inherently carry profound religious meaning, it has historically been intertwined with various beliefs, including astrology and zodiac signs. For example, this year is the Year of the Ox (or Bull), and many traditions, such as eating fish to symbolize surplus and prosperity, are rooted in cultural superstitions. For Christians, these practices hold no spiritual significance. A Christian does not believe that eating fish will bring prosperity or that zodiac signs determine one’s fate. Such beliefs are considered superstitions and are incompatible with Christian faith.

For a Christian, the Chinese New Year might raise questions about its purpose. Why are we gathering with family? Why do we have this extended vacation? To address this, I propose that we use this time to celebrate the Edict of Milan, which was issued in February. This historic decree, signed by Emperor Constantine and Emperor Licinius, marked the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire and ushered in a new era for the Church. It symbolized the victory of Christianity over paganism, much like the ancient Chinese ritual of Dan-no, which sought to expel illness and bring renewal.

The Edict of Milan is of immense importance to the Church and to all Christians, as it represents the triumph of faith over paganism and the beginning of a Christianized world. Yet, for some reason, it is not widely commemorated today. This is a missed opportunity. Remembering and celebrating this event can bring profound meaning to the Chinese New Year for Christians. It serves as a reminder of the call for all nations, including China, to embrace Christianity. This is the key to true success in the eyes of God and a source of great joy and purpose for every Christian, regardless of where they live.

By infusing the Chinese New Year with this Christian significance, we can transform it from a mere social or cultural event into a meaningful spiritual celebration. Even if our families do not fully understand this perspective, we can still find personal fulfillment in honoring this historic moment. If we fail to emphasize this Christian content, the celebration risks being dominated by superstitions and zodiac symbolism, which have no place in the Christian faith. Instead, let us use this time to reflect on the victory of Christianity and its enduring relevance in our lives.

And Christians must be cautious. If we do not Christianize pagan traditions, those traditions may paganize us. It’s as simple as that. We must remain steadfast in our true faith in God, knowing that with Him, we have everything we need. Let us pray that He blesses us, grants us wisdom, and strengthens our faith so that we may overcome all challenges and bring everything under His authority, for His glory and our joy. May God bless you!
