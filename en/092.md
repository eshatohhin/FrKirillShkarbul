# Mission in Oceania and elsewhere are we late

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are on a mission in the Northern Mariana Islands, specifically on the island of Rota, also known as Luta, the southernmost island of this group. The Northern Mariana Islands consist of 14 islands, of which 3 are populated, and the remaining 11 are largely uninhabited. These uninhabited islands are volcanic and home to goats, with at most 40-50 people living on them. Among the populated islands, Rota is the least populated, with only about 3,000 residents. It is also the most remote of the three, which has helped preserve the Chamorro culture and language to a greater extent, as it has been less Americanized. We hope to establish an Orthodox mission here. Today, I want to share some reflections from my time in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). I will discuss the island of Rota in more detail in my next video.

Approximately 200 years ago, there was an Orthodox mission here. Orthodox missionaries arrived on ships alongside explorers who were navigating the Pacific Ocean, traveling to places like Hawaii, the Mariana Islands, the Aleutian Islands, and Taiwan. Historical records indicate that scientists and even some settlements were present on the islands of Tinian and Saipan. There are also accounts of a church and a priest conducting liturgies and divine services here. We plan to conduct further research to gather more documented evidence. However, that mission did not leave a lasting legacy, as it was short-lived, and the local population did not embrace the message at that time. Now, the Lord has given us another opportunity to carry out this mission. With modern technology, we can easily travel here by plane to continue this work.

My visit feels somewhat delayed, as there was a significant Orthodox presence here in the 1990s, with people from Russia, Greece, Ukraine, and Serbia engaging in business, real estate, tourism, and other services in Saipan and Guam. There were discussions about establishing a church and building a chapel, but unfortunately, these plans did not come to fruition. At that time, it was easier to bring missionaries, as no visa was required for Russians.

So, there was a great and excellent time for mission, but unfortunately, this opportunity was not utilized. As a result, there is currently no established or functioning Orthodox mission here. It would have been wonderful to have an ongoing Orthodox witness and testimony today if that opportunity had been seized. However, for 20 years, we had a window of opportunity to begin the mission here, and it was not difficult to do so. Yet, it was not done, and now that window has closed. My visit here during these pandemic times makes it challenging to ask others to come, and it is difficult to carry out the mission with so few Orthodox people remaining. Most of those who lived here have already left, moving elsewhere. In many respects, we have missed that opportunity. Nevertheless, we must still try and do what we can, because the Lord desires the mission to develop, expand, and establish an Orthodox presence everywhere—on these islands, across the Pacific, and beyond.

However, the issue is not limited to the Marianas and the mission here. The broader problem is that all of us have opportunities—windows of mission—that are open to us right now, but we often fail to recognize or value them. We wait for divine providence to intervene, while we remain passive. For some, the Marianas Islands may be next door, or it could be a neighboring town with no Orthodox presence. It might even be an online platform like YouTube, WeChat, WhatsApp, or other internet spaces. The world is increasingly becoming a "cyber desert," where children are taught to live in virtual realities, games, and portals, with no Orthodox presence. Yet, we have the ability to do mission work anytime, in many places—whether through testimony, witnessing our love for Christ, sharing our faith, or reaching out to others. We must not be lazy. Our problem is that we are often lazy and fail to seize these windows of opportunity, as is evident here, particularly in Saipan and now on Rota, where it feels a bit too late.

Please pray for the mission here, and take this as a challenge from the Lord to do mission work in your own place—whether it’s next door, with your relatives, friends, or even within yourself. We must bring the message not with passion or fanaticism, but with good grounding in faith, ensuring that we know what we are talking about. Our faith must come from the heart, not just as knowledge we share, but as a lived experience. We must share our love for Christ, just as the Apostle Paul did. His mission was to help others fall in love with Christ, and this should be our goal as well.

As a symbolic commemoration and an invitation for the locals to learn more about the Orthodox Church, we are planning to establish three Orthodox commemorative crosses on the Marianas Islands. One will be placed on the volcano of Alion de Pajaros, the northernmost point, and two larger ones on the islands of Anatahan and Bagan, where some people still visit. We have spoken to the mayor and the governor, and they have no objections. This will be a small but meaningful step—a mark to honor the missionaries who labored here in the past and a sign of hope for the future of the Orthodox mission in the Marianas and throughout the Pacific Oceania region.

Thank you very much for your prayers and support. Please prepare for mission work and do as much as you can in your own diocese or the place you are responsible for. Let us not miss the opportunities before us.

May the Lord bless you and grant you wisdom and strength. Amen.
