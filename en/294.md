# Misery of the Beast, and Global Chaos

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord said, "Believe in the light so that you may become children of light." This is from the Gospel of John, chapter 12. Last time, we spoke about how Christians are called to become children of light, and unless we become children of light, we are not truly Christians. Today, I want to continue this topic, especially as we begin to prepare for the Great Lent. We still have three weeks of preparation, and in preparing for this season, I want to share with you some of my thoughts about the world we live in, particularly in the context of the darkness that is trying to overcome this world—what is happening, and what is our role as those called to be children of light, these lamps, if you will, through which the Lord shines upon this world.

From the Holy Fathers, we know that evil, darkness, and the devil will stumble upon the truth. For them, the light and goodness that come from God are the greatest obstacles. This is why they are called Satan—they are against it, but their opposition is rooted in vanity. They cannot do anything. If you compare the power of God and the so-called power of the devil, the devil is nothing—absolutely nothing. He is unable to do anything directly against God, His light, His grace, or His goodness, however you want to phrase it. As long as we are partakers of His grace, His light, and His goodness, any darkness, sin, or evil power is nothing to us—completely insignificant.

Often, the devil tries to portray himself as almighty and omnipresent, making it seem as though evil in this world is so overwhelming that he has conquered it. But when we encounter evil, it is often just a matter of poking it with your finger, so to speak, and it collapses. At least spiritually, this is the case. He tries to use forces—economic, political, surveillance—but all of that would mean nothing to us if we are spiritually free. If you are spiritually free, you could be in a concentration camp, a prison, or anywhere, and you would still be much closer to God. In such circumstances, you would have an even greater testimony for the Lord. For the devil, that would be a loss; he would be conquered. Even though it may seem like he has the prison, the guards, and control over you, he has nothing. He is merely helping you to bring forth a stronger testimony. We should keep this in mind when we talk about these evil forces.

Now, I want to share with you some thoughts about the world we live in, which is currently experiencing significant political and economic turmoil, wars, and perhaps more to come. Why is this happening, and what is the devil's aim behind all these things? There is evidently some relationship between these events and the devil's influence. What is this relationship? Well, it is not easy to understand the devil's plan because, in truth, he does not have a coherent plan. The devil is self-contradictory, and this is why he fails. He has been failing for 2,000 years since the Lord's resurrection and ascension, and he continues to lose. He has been unable, even to this day, to bring forth his Antichrist, to rule the world, or to bring all nations under his spiritual leadership.

Why is this the case? If you think about it, all his ideas and plans are self-contradictory. For example, on one hand, he wants people to be rich so they can indulge in pleasures, materialism, and mammon. On the other hand, he wants people to be poor so they are more dependent, controllable, and fearful. He doesn't know whether to make people rich or poor or something in between. His strategies are inconsistent and ultimately lead to his own downfall.

He wants people to be fed with all kinds of things, or he wants them to be hungry. He desires peace so that everyone is relaxed and complacent, or he craves war so that people suffer and kill one another. His existence is built on contradictions, or antinomies. His very being is an antinomy—a theological paradox. He owes his existence to the creating power and mercy of God, and in some twisted way, he must give thanks to the Lord for his existence. Yet, at the same time, he hates God, tries to run away from Him, and seeks to overthrow His dominion over this world. This makes him self-contradictory in his very essence.

You can even consider his ultimate goal. What is it? His final aim is destruction—uttermost destruction, corruption, and vanity. This is his endgame: *Avadon*, which means ruin or annihilation. But how can destruction be a goal? A goal is supposed to be something good, something positive, something that brings fulfillment or achievement. Yet, his goal offers nothing but suffering, destruction, and condemnation. In itself, this is a contradiction. He is the most miserable existence, the most wretched being in this world, and everyone who follows him shares in that misery.

You can find countless examples of his contradictions. On one hand, he promotes freedom, liberalism, LGBTQ ideologies, and the idea that everything is permissible—no sin, no boundaries. On the other hand, he wants to present himself as an authority, demanding that people worship him as God. To do this, he claims to be virtuous, opposing sin and immorality. This is a contradiction in itself. 

Similarly, he pushes the World Economic Forum (WEF) agenda, advocating for sustainable development, neo-fascist control, and a totalitarian, stable government. Yet, at the same time, he desires anarchy, constant revolution, rapid change, techno-optimism, singularity, and the destruction of existing systems. These are more contradictions within his agenda.

This is why it’s dangerous to simply say, "Oh, they want this? They’re with Schwab? Okay, we’re against it." That’s not enough. You must remember that someone who opposes one aspect of the devil’s plan might still be aligned with him in another way. If we want to stand with the Lord, we cannot merely be against something; we must be *with* the Lord. Only then can we discern what aligns with His plan of salvation and what does not.

Having said that, we can observe that the world is currently experiencing tremendous instability—shaking economically, politically, technologically, and in terms of values, philosophies, and every other sense. What does this mean? It means that the devil is not satisfied with the state of the world as it is today. Despite all the evil, apostasy, and corruption we see, the world is not yet ready for the Antichrist to rise and rule. The apostasy, though significant, is not total enough for him to fully establish his dominion. This should remind us not to view the world with only negativity, thinking that everything is bad and falling apart. No, there is still something holding the devil back, and we should give thanks to the Lord for this. We live in a time when, despite the darkness, the light of Christ still shines.

In the Bible, we find the words that for those who are in the light, everything is light. If we have the light of Christ within us, we will see light even in the darkest places. We will see hope, compassion, and love for even the worst sinners—not for their sins, but because they are alive, created by God, and called to exist. Glory to God! We can see God in everything and everyone—in nature, which He sustains and brings to life every day, and even in urban, technocratic centers. His presence is everywhere, and we can feel it if we open our hearts to Him. Therefore, we should not be overly negative about the state of the world. Instead, let us consider what is holding the Antichrist back, because one day he will rule this world. In those days, people may look back at our time as a relatively godly and wonderful era.

What is holding the Antichrist back? It is righteousness and truth—*takah*, as we read in the Bible. The entire New Testament, the teachings of Christ, and His message revolve around this righteousness or truth. This concept is sometimes translated differently because modern English cannot fully capture its depth in a single word. In one of our recent lectures, we discussed how the nine Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount are all about this righteousness. Every single Beatitude points to it. Even in this corrupted, apostate world, there is still so much righteousness that it prevents the Antichrist from coming.

We can see this righteousness, this light of Christ—these divine *logos*—still present in the world, even in the most terrible people. Even those who are heading straight to hell still carry a measure of righteousness within them. For example, criminals who kill, swear, and commit terrible acts may still love their children, have a sense of justice in their dealings, or feel shame. They do not walk naked in the streets because they instinctively know it is wrong. Even in their corruption, they feel compelled to behave in a certain way when they step into the world. This feeling comes from the righteousness that the Lord has implanted in the hearts of every person.

As the Apostle Paul tells us, even the Gentiles, who do not know the law of God, often behave according to it. They make many mistakes, yes, but they still reflect the divine imprint of righteousness within them. This is why the Antichrist cannot yet rise—because the light of Christ, the truth, and the righteousness He has sown in human hearts still hold sway. Let us give thanks for this and strive to live in that light, so that we may continue to be a barrier against the darkness.

but still, very often, they behave in ways that reflect this righteousness, which comes only from God and nowhere else. We can increase this righteousness—this is what we are called to do. Each one of us must become a beam of light, a beam of righteousness, that transforms the reality around us and prevents the devil from gaining ground. This was the topic of another video I recently shared.

We must also learn not to place too much hope in this world. We should disassociate ourselves from this corrupted world that is heading toward destruction and apostasy. The world is trying to pull everyone into a single narrative—that we are all part of a common era, modernity, and that we are all supposed to think and act in a certain way. There is a grand narrative for the entire world and smaller narratives for different regions, but the world is attempting to draw us into these frameworks. We need to step out of these narratives and recognize that the true narrative begins with each of us—the narrative of Christ. This is what truly matters, far more than what political leaders like Trump, Putin, or Xi Jinping are doing. What matters most is what each of us is doing in terms of our spiritual life and ministry.

Detaching ourselves from the world’s narrative helps us build our plans with God’s guidance—both short-term and long-term spiritual plans. These plans must be revised according to God’s will, and we must follow them diligently. This is what truly matters.

We can discuss the state of the world from both a positive and negative perspective, but we should avoid extremes. From the negative perspective, I can share an example from yesterday. I went to a large shopping mall to buy some things. This mall is enormous, and people spend hours there every day. Yet, there is not a single bookstore. We talk about reading the Gospel, not just as a text but as a prayer. But here, we’re not even talking about that—we’re talking about the simple act of opening a book. Few people today have the will or desire to read a book about anything—not just about Christ or spirituality, but even classics or general knowledge. Reading itself is becoming difficult for many. People are more interested in buying things, eating ice cream, shopping for watches, pajamas, or whatever catches their eye. For the majority, this is all that matters.

This shows how deep the apostasy has become. Reading a book doesn’t save you, and even reading the Bible doesn’t save you if you’re not putting effort into your spiritual life. You could be a heretic, or even an Orthodox Christian reading the Bible, but if you’re not striving spiritually, it won’t save you. This reveals how far the majority of people are from salvation. It’s a sad situation, but on an individual level, it also clarifies what we must do—and what we must avoid. We must not become like the world. Instead, we must walk a spiritual path of prayer and fasting. Even dedicating a small portion of our lives to prayer and fasting has great meaning for our salvation and for the Lord, especially when the rest of the world is heading toward destruction.

Let us not overcomplicate the will of God. It is clear: we are called to live in righteousness, to be beams of light, and to resist the world’s pull toward destruction. By doing so, we fulfill our role in holding back the darkness and preparing for the coming of Christ.

What is the Lord asking of me? Let’s not overcomplicate it. As long as we find the path of spiritual life, take up our cross, and avoid falling into heresy, delusion, or spiritual dormancy, we are on the right track. Vigilance, spiritual life, prayer, testimony, and a craving for the Word of God—this is what the Lord desires from us. This is what truly matters. Everything else—economics, politics, and worldly concerns—are secondary. Let us avoid falling into other delusions, especially those that can distract us from our true mission.

For example, there is a significant delusion among some Orthodox Christians: the idea that we must create a great Orthodox civilization, perhaps based on a Russian Orthodox Empire, or the restoration of Byzantium, or the reclaiming of Constantinople. Some believe that such a civilization would become a beacon of light for the entire world. But these are surrogates—false substitutes that deceive people, leading them to hatred, division, and even death. For us, the mission the Lord has given to each individual is what truly matters. This is what is real, not some grand, imposed narrative of nationalism, imperialism, or political ambition.

What matters is what I can do today, tomorrow, and in the years to come in terms of my ministry to the Lord. Bringing forth spiritual fruit, living a life pleasing to Him, and strengthening ourselves in prayer, dedication, and the pursuit of truth—this is our calling. Let us not be distracted by surrogates or false ideals. Instead, let us focus on making our faith alive and active.

May the Lord help us prepare for the Great Lent this year, strengthen us in our ministry, and make our lives pleasing to Him. May He guide us in prayer, deepen our dedication, and fuel our pursuit of truth. Let us strive to live out our faith in a way that brings glory to God. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
