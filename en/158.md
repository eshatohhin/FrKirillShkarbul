# Emerging “future world” & plan of the satan

Dear brothers and sisters, I am once again in Taichung, in the heart of Taiwan.  
Yesterday, we held a service for all the saints. This is the service we observe after Pentecost.  
On Pentecost, we commemorate the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and disciples.  
All the saints are the fruit of the Holy Spirit's descent. The Holy Spirit unites us with Jesus Christ.  
By living in Jesus Christ, the Church upholds these truths: the saints bore witness to the faith,  
affirming that the love of Christ is true and real, and that His resurrection is real.  

After celebrating all the saints, we are now entering the season of the apostles.  
Today marks the beginning of a three-week fast leading up to the feast of the greatest apostles, Peter and Paul,  
which falls on July 12th. This is approximately three weeks from now.  
During this time, we will pray more fervently and reflect on our role and calling from the Lord to combat Satan.  
We now face him as our adversary. He stands against God, and if we are with God, he stands against us.  
This struggle will not be easy.  

Today, I wish to conclude the topic I began last time, which is closely related to this.  
Please refer to the previous discussion, as it provides the necessary background on how the world adopted a capitalistic mindset  
and how the devil has made numerous attempts to establish his own kingdom and system, striving for more control.  
By examining recent history in the 19th and 20th centuries, we can see various rehearsals of the Antichrist attempting to establish his kingdom.  
This is not mere speculation—it is history.  

Some may say, "Marxism is dead. Totalitarian regimes like Hitler's fascism are all in the past.  
We are in a new world now, with a bright future ahead. Everything is more optimistic."  
But this is not the case. The devil will not allow us to step into our envisioned bright future.  
He has his own plans for this future, and he is actively working to draw the entire world into his new system,  
his new world order, which he is striving to establish now.  

We must recognize the signs of this new world order.  
You will notice that in different countries—even those seemingly at war or vastly different—  
there are similar policies and directions, all pushing toward the same goal.  
Spiritually, what does this signify? It signifies humanity's collective choice to turn away from God.  
Most have decided, "No, I want to align with the devil, with mammon, with this world.  
I only want to enjoy this world; I do not care about God."  
The Lord will respond, "If you truly do not want Me, then do as you wish. Build this new Babylon you desire,  
but know that it will lead to the destruction of your souls." This is the broader picture.  

It is not that God is absent or uninvolved in this world; rather, He does not interfere with free will.  
If humanity chooses to follow the devil, the Lord will allow it, saying, "Try, and you will see the consequences."  
We must recognize this darkness, for it presents itself as a bright future, a solution to all of humanity's problems, a savior.  
The Holy Father has said that the Antichrist will come as a savior to the oppressed, the deprived, and the exploited.  
We have seen this before—Lenin and the socialists claimed, "We are saving the world, liberating the proletariat," and so on.  
At that time, many were able to discern that this was not divine but satanic. Yet, Marxism and socialism were highly attractive,  
and half the world embraced these ideologies and lived under their influence.

Even in capitalist countries, many people embraced these utopian ideas, but the reality was too grim, and it did not unfold as they had hoped.  
Now, however, these ideologies have been fine-tuned, and people no longer possess the ability to discern them clearly.  
Everyone is preoccupied with work, leaving no time to think critically. Instead, others shape the agenda, decide what we should believe, and propagate it through social media and other channels.  
This is what we are presented with today.  

For those of us who have chosen to follow Christ, we understand that in the kingdom of the Antichrist, there will be no place for the gospel, for the truth of the Lord, or for the true Church.  
Therefore, let us reflect deeply on the signs and characteristics of this emerging new order, this system that is taking shape before our eyes.  
It may take several generations to fully materialize, as events are unfolding rapidly, but we cannot predict how long it will take for this grand plan to reach its culmination.  
Nevertheless, we can see it happening right now, as we speak.  

First, we must recognize that this new order will present itself as something highly attractive and beneficial—a savior for the planet.  
It will be seductive, making it difficult to reject because it will appear to offer immense benefits to humanity.  
This is one key aspect. It will not resemble a gloomy dictatorship but rather a rosy salvation plan.  

Additionally, this plan will be presented as inevitable.  
There will be no alternative solutions to the world's problems; this will be portrayed as the only possible path forward.  
It will be framed as a natural progression dictated by the realities of the world.  
This is the intriguing part: it will not merely be a presentation but an engineered reality.  
Those behind it aim to shape the world in such a way that this direction becomes unavoidable.  
It will not be another Hitler or Stalin; it will be something that appears to arise logically from the world's development.  
They want it to be inescapable, not something conditional that can be overthrown or rejected.  
This time, they aim to implement it globally, leaving no room for escape.  

Furthermore, this system will demand compliance.  
Those who do not align with it will be marginalized or entirely destroyed.  
If you do not fit into this new order, you will have no right to exist.  
It will not be a matter of personal preference—liking or disliking it.  
We do not yet know how strict this enforcement will be—whether it will involve outright elimination or subtler forms of exclusion, such as being left to perish from illness or societal neglect.  
If it is merely marginalization, it may not seem so severe, but it could be far harsher.  
However, for those who embrace it early, the benefits will be immense, making it highly appealing.  

In many ways, this new order will resemble Marxist and socialist ideologies.  
To better understand what is happening, I recommend revisiting and reviewing the principles of Marxism and socialism.  
We are told these are relics of the past, but serious economists still study Marx's *Capital*, and Marxist theory is far from dogmatic.  
True Marxism is highly flexible, adapting to circumstances and evolving continuously.  
This is the essence of Trotskyism—the concept of perpetual revolution.  
The goal remains constant, but the methods and strategies are adjusted based on the prevailing reality.  
This flexibility is why these ideas are being repurposed and utilized extensively today.  
This is also why we are given these hints about what is to come.

We are leftists, and we also hold a certain reverence for figures like Lenin and others of his ilk. Indeed, they belong to the same ideological lineage.  
It is simply a new era, a different epoch, but the spirit and fundamental intentions remain strikingly similar.  
There will be adjustments, but this will essentially be a revival of socialism.  
The so-called "inclusive capitalism" they speak of is, in essence, socialism in a new form.  
It may not entirely eliminate private property, and in fact, the Marxists and socialists of the past did not eliminate private property for the proletariat.  
You could still own basic personal items—your shoes, your CD player, or similar possessions.  
However, as a proletarian, you were not meant to own significant assets.  
This is why they envision a society by 2030 where "you own nothing and you're happy."  
Of course, this means you won't own anything substantial—no houses, no cars.  
It will no longer be economically viable to own such things.  
Instead, you will rent everything, granting you the freedom to move and change locations as you please.  
They will offer benefits designed to make this lifestyle appealing.  
However, this also means you will become entirely dependent on the system.  
If your rating drops, you will lose access to housing and other necessities, leaving you powerless.  
You will be completely reliant on a system that monitors, supervises, educates, and indoctrinates you.  
You will be bound to its values, ways of life, and structures, with no economic independence or freedom.  

This is already happening—the idea of "you own nothing."  
This is Marxism, socialism, and even communism in action: the notion that you have no need to own anything.  
They are also discussing the implementation of a universal basic income, which aligns with this vision.  
People will be pushed into the proletariat class, with no small or medium-sized businesses to speak of.  
Everyone will be reduced to the same level—ordinary, simple people.  
While it may not be as extreme as the Soviet Union's enforced equality, it will still be a proletarian society.  
A few massive corporations will control all resources—tech giants like Google, Amazon, and others.  
They will dominate production and present themselves as benevolent entities caring for societal well-being.  
Unlike the capitalists of the past, who were solely profit-driven, these corporations will adopt a more paternalistic role, similar to what has been observed in Japan for some time.  

Moreover, everything will be digitized.  
Artificial intelligence (AI) will oversee major decisions regarding the services and benefits you receive.  
Your entire existence will be digitized, with a digital avatar representing you in this new system.  
Life will become increasingly virtualized, moving into the cloud and the metaverse—a blend of virtual and real existence.  
You will wear augmented reality glasses that provide additional information, enhance your decision-making, and make your time more efficient.  
Every aspect of this system will come with significant benefits, making it irresistible to most.  
This is why everyone will embrace it.

Cyborgization will also play a significant role in this new order.  
You will have various gadgets, perhaps even a single device that monitors all your vital parameters—your breathing, heart rate, glucose levels, and everything else.  
It will advise you on what pills or mixtures to take for your health, promising increased longevity, improved well-being, and a better quality of life.  
The benefits will be so compelling that everyone will adopt these technologies.  
The groundwork for this is already in place, with advancements from institutions like Harvard indicating that such technologies are imminent.  

While these innovations can be used for good, they will also render you entirely dependent on the system.  
You will have no choice but to follow its instructions—what to eat, which vaccines to take, and other directives.  
You won't have the ability to verify or question its calculations; you will simply have to trust it.  
This system will become your source of life, replacing God as the ultimate authority.  
Whereas we now rely on God as our source of life, in this new order, AI and the system will take His place.  
If you resist, you will face dire consequences—perhaps death from illness or other means.  
Compliance will be mandatory.  

Additionally, this new order will replace traditional religions with a new form of spirituality, such as New Age practices, yoga, meditation, and hypnosis.  
These will serve as escapes from stress and problems, inducing a state of spiritual numbness and apathy.  
This pseudo-religion will eliminate the need for God, replacing the search for divine truth with superficial rituals and practices.  
True faith, which awakens and liberates the soul, will have no place in this system.  
They want you to conform to their ideology, not to seek spiritual freedom.  

It is difficult to predict how harsh the restrictions on the Church will be.  
In some regions, the Church may be marginalized, facing severe financial and moral pressures, causing it to shrink significantly.  
In other places, it may be reduced to a mere artifact—a decorative institution devoid of its core message.  
It will exist as a hollow shell, performing rituals without the essence of Christ's teachings.  
In some areas, the Church may be outright destroyed or forbidden, as seen in countries like China, where the Orthodox Church is essentially illegal, or in many Muslim nations.  

This new world order will manifest differently across regions, but it will all align with a single, overarching master plan.  
Do not be deceived by the appearance of competing nations; their conflicts are merely performances.  
Fundamentally, they are united in their push toward digitalization, social engineering, and globalized control.  
The most critical aspects of society—education, ideology, and worldview—are being shaped by those who are steering the world in this direction.  

We will increasingly see a globalized educational system that brainwashes people into a common ideology.  
It will dictate what is good, what is bad, and how you should live.  
This is the reality we are moving toward, and it is essential to remain vigilant and rooted in the truth of Christ amidst these changes.

People will feel convinced, "Yes, this is the best for me."  
The propaganda will be subtle, almost imperceptible, designed to avoid triggering resistance.  
They aim for a seamless, natural integration of this ideology into everyday life, ensuring it is embraced by 99.9% of the population.  
It will permeate every aspect of society, shaping how people think and react uniformly.  
Over time, this uniformity will grow stronger, creating a world where everyone shares the same mindset and responses.  

They will proclaim, "Look at this unity. There are no wars, no social tensions. This system is a triumph of humanity.  
We have finally achieved paradise on Earth, a new Babylon. It is a success."  
And the masses will echo, "Yes, this is it."  

We must remain aware of where the world is heading.  
Individual events and developments may seem positive—advancements in science, ecological initiatives, environmental protection—but when viewed as part of the bigger picture, their true nature becomes clear.  
This system is satanic. It has no place for God, faith, religion, or human freedom.  
It seeks to replace worship of God with loyalty and adoration of the Antichrist.  
It demands complete dependence and love for this new order, leaving no room for any other object of devotion.  
The Antichrist wants to be everything to you—your source of life, your ultimate authority.  

We must be vigilant and prepared for what is to come.  
The period leading up to 2030 may be tumultuous, marked by wars, revolutions, and social upheaval.  
However, those behind this system hope to establish their new order during this time.  
It may take generations to fully implement, as past attempts—such as the communist world revolution—have failed.  
This new system may also face setbacks, backlashes, or even collapse.  
After all, its architects are not gods but mere humans, tools of the devil.  
Yet, the devil is persistent. He will continue to push his agenda in various forms, adapting and trying again.  

Many old ideas, such as eugenics—once favored by the Nazis and even British scientists a century ago—are resurfacing in new guises.  
Genetic engineering and advancements in science are reviving these concepts, aiming to create "better" humans.  
The devil's plan is relentless, and he will keep trying in different ways to achieve his goals.  

We must recognize the devil's hatred for humanity.  
He does not offer these things out of love but out of malice.  
His aim is to separate us from God, to trap us in his system, and to lead our souls to destruction and eternal condemnation.  
We must guard ourselves against his schemes, remaining steadfast in our faith and prepared to face any temptation or deceit he devises.  

May the Lord and all the saints be with us, granting us wisdom and strength in this spiritual battle.  
May we remain vigilant, rooted in truth, and unwavering in our devotion to Christ.  
God bless.
