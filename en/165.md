# What does it really mean to be Orthodox

Dear brothers and sisters, sometimes people ask me what the Orthodox faith is in essence.  
We see history, we see traditions, we see priests, vestments, and many other things.  
Of course, there are dogmatics, and some people say that the right dogmatics are the essence of the Orthodox faith.  
However, in the first centuries, we didn’t have all those dogmatics.  
So, in essence, if we look at what the Orthodox faith is and the Orthodox relationship with the Lord, it is the true, authentic relationship of love—loving Christ without any departure, without any addition. It is much simpler than it may seem.  
It’s not that difficult, not that complex. Any heresy, any schism, or departure from Orthodoxy arises because of love for something else—love for this world, for what is in this world: lifestyle, way of thinking, way of living, some pagan philosophy, or some other comfort. It is the unwillingness to completely sacrifice oneself, take up one’s cross, and follow Christ. That is where all these heresies and deviations come from.  

Of course, this doesn’t mean that Orthodox people themselves don’t deviate or that all of them love Christ. Unfortunately, that is not the case. But at least in the Orthodox Church, the Church tells them what is deviation and what is not. In other groups, it has gone completely astray, and they lack the self-healing mechanism that exists in the Orthodox Church—the Holy Eucharist, the communion. This is where we derive our true relationship with the living Christ, who will rectify, who will change our false direction, our mistakes, and our worldliness. He will change us.  

This is a miracle that happens because, for people, it is impossible to reach on their own. And to be honest, we ourselves do not love Christ the way we should, if we are honest with ourselves.  

What Orthodoxy brings to us is the remembrance of the Lord’s words in John 14:21: “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, that one loves me.” So, if we have these commandments, we do not dilute them with other things. We do not say, “Okay, adultery—well, it’s not really adultery.” No, adultery is adultery. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” This is one of the Beatitudes. Yet, we fill ourselves with all kinds of garbage from this world, and we are attracted by that garbage—coming from advertisements, music, and everywhere else. No, if our heart is not clean, we will not see God.

Blessed are the poor in spirit—not those who can talk and have their opinions about everything, about faith, and about all matters. Such people are not humble, and humility is not their virtue. If it is not a virtue, then it is not a virtue. This is what it means to have these commandments. As an Orthodox Church, we do not lose them, dilute them, or pollute them with anything else. These are the commandments of the Lord that bring salvation. And it is not enough to merely have them; we must also keep them, live by them, and live according to these commandments—which is completely impossible for humans to do on their own.  

By keeping these commandments, we break away from this world and show our love for Christ. We demonstrate that love whenever we keep these commandments and live by them, leading a holy life of serving God, taking up our cross, sacrificing ourselves, and following Him. We become His witnesses through how we live and through what fills our inner world.  

In the Gospel of John (2:25), it is written: “Jesus did not need anyone to testify about man, for He knew what was in man.” The Lord knew and saw directly what was in the heart, what spirit a person had within them. He knew it immediately, perhaps without even needing to look. This is what matters—what is within us. We are Orthodox not because we adhere to some true dogmas, or because we were baptized Orthodox and are automatically Orthodox, or because we wear Orthodox clothing, carry an Orthodox cross, or possess something else. No, we are Orthodox if what is within us—what the Lord sees—is love for Him. We are the holy temple of God, or at least we strive to build it as much as possible. We make this our first priority in life.  

I do not wish to speak about the heresies that departed long ago from the path of salvation. Perhaps within those groups, there are still some individuals seeking the truth, but overall, their teachings are deeply wrong. Catholicism and Protestantism have strayed; they do not want the way of the cross. Instead, they seek to adjust Christ to serve their fallen selves, to serve Mammon rather than Jesus Christ.  

However, when we speak of the Orthodox Church itself, we must also examine our own problems and strive to avoid such pitfalls. For example, Byzantium was once the brightest light of faith for many nations. It was a great beacon of faith shining out to the barbaric peoples, and many of them received the true faith and followed Jesus Christ. But later, Byzantium itself fell away. Saint Gregory Palamas, in the 14th century—not long before Byzantium was conquered by the Turks—wrote that this city, once the city of God, where everyone loved one another and served the Lord, had become a place where people stole from one another, fought, quarreled, and acted selfishly. It seemed as though enemies had invaded the city, plundering and fighting among themselves. This was his perception of Constantinople, and he was a citizen of Byzantium. His criticism came from within, for he was a holy man who saw these things clearly.  

Soon after, Byzantium was destroyed, and we believe the reason was that the people lost their love for God and for one another. The Lord’s grace and protection could no longer preserve that place. There is another testimony from a foreigner who visited Constantinople around the same time, in the 13th or 14th century. He wrote that the only impression he had of the city was the immense worship of wealth and money, and the idolatry of material things that consumed its citizens.

This observation comes from a foreigner, not yet Orthodox, who noted that the people living there worshiped Mammon—the golden calf. They were consumed by the desire to enrich themselves, build better houses, acquire nicer clothes, and indulge in material pursuits. Is this the Orthodox capital? Not at all. Formally, it still was, but very soon it was destroyed by the Turks and became Muslim.  

This shows that we are not immune to worldliness. We, too, can fall into it. One of the biggest problems in the Orthodox Church today is our close relationship with the government. In the beginning, this relationship was helpful. Pious kings and queens genuinely wanted to develop the Church and bring all nations to Christ, so they supported the Church as Christians. But now, the government serves Mammon, and our close relationship with it has become a burden. We still hope to gain something from the government, but it uses the Church for its own purposes. This relationship has become like shackles, tying the Church to Mammon and pulling it down, preventing true spiritual progress.  

This is one of the problems we still face, unfortunately. Another issue is the rhetoric that equates nationality with Orthodoxy—saying that if you are Russian, you must be Orthodox; if you are Greek, you must be Orthodox; if you are Romanian, you must be Orthodox. This mindset reduces Orthodoxy to a cultural or ethnic identity, and the result is that Orthodoxy becomes almost a swear word. People look at the secular and pagan behavior of those who are supposedly Orthodox and say, “Oh, now we know what Orthodoxy is. These are corrupt, filthy, greedy people without ethics. That’s Orthodoxy.” It becomes a great shame.  

The Church must make it clear that nationality has nothing to do with Orthodoxy. If you want to be Orthodox, you must enter into a new world, a new realm, leaving everything else behind. This world can go wherever it wants—according to a “great reset,” according to some plan, or whatever agenda it follows. But the Church must remain the Church. We must not be dragged into following someone else’s agenda, whether it’s a government, an international body, or anything else. We must remain loyal to Christ and cut our ties to this fallen world. We must break free from these shackles.  

Moreover, Orthodoxy often comes in a superficial, nominal form. For example, we see nice photos of priests in vestments, standing in churches, or performing rituals. People say, “Oh, this is Orthodoxy,” or “That priest looks so Orthodox.” But this is nothing more than a model, a cosplay, a Hollywood performance. It has nothing to do with the true faith. Yes, the Church has forms, but these forms are not what make it Orthodox. What makes it Orthodox is whether we are with the Lord, whether our hearts are open to Him. The Lord said we must become like children. If your heart is like a child’s, embracing grace, that is Orthodoxy.  

It is not about being a theologian with big glasses, surrounded by books, saying, “I’m Orthodox because I’ve read so many Holy Fathers and articles.” Nor is it about being an analyst who dissects everything and speaks about everything. No matter how educated you are, the truth is simple. You must be like a child, with an open heart and an open mind, to perceive the truth. If you approach it with a Talmudic mindset, you will never grasp the truth. It will always slip away from you.

This is what some call "Buddhaphoric Orthodoxy"—a superficial, ritualistic obsession that some people cling to. There are other distorted forms of Orthodoxy as well. For example, there is the "Orthodoxy or death" mentality, where some adopt a paramilitary attitude, wearing black shirts, exuding anger and power, and declaring, "We will kill you no matter what you do—Orthodoxy or death." This has nothing to do with true Orthodoxy, faith, love, or following Christ by taking up one’s cross. It is a strange and dangerous distortion, yet these people present themselves as the defenders of Orthodoxy.  

Sometimes, Orthodoxy is associated with grand titles—great, most holy, highest, holiness, and so on. But this, too, is not true Orthodoxy. It is all a constructed facade. We remember the revolution in Russia, where everything—cathedrals, clergy, and traditions—was swept away in an instant. Now, the agenda of this world seeks to destroy whatever remains of true Christianity. If we do not understand the essence of our faith—what we are truly ready to die for—we will be swept away or misled. We are not called to die for vestments, rituals, or titles. We are called to die for Christ. If we do not grasp this, we risk being swept away by the world’s agenda, worshiping the "indomitable creature" who will declare himself to be like God and receive his kingdom.  

Let us instead be like children, always seeking the Lord. Orthodoxy is not about intellectual understanding—saying, "Now I get it; I’ve read this and that, so now I know what Orthodoxy is." No, Orthodoxy is like entering a palace, a new realm, and staying there. It is a new life, a new reality, and this is where we want to dwell always. To become Orthodox means to enter the Church, to make it our daily task to seek Jesus Christ. We must always think of Him, always search for His truth in everything we encounter. For us, He must become the content of our life, our mind, and our heart.  

Do we love His commandments? Do they bring us salvation? Do we draw life from them? Our whole heart must seek Him. We must desire to be caught in His net, as He said, like fish drawn in. We do not want to slip through and wander away. We want to remain in that net, which means we do not follow our own will but the Lord’s will—even if it brings suffering, humiliation, or hardship. We are willing to take up our cross and follow Him. Otherwise, we remain outside His providence and care. He will not be with us, help us, or guide us if we do not desire it ourselves. We will simply wander aimlessly, living a useless life.  

Let us ask the Lord to give us such a heart—a heart that loves Him and remains on this path. May He help us stay true and loyal to Him, truly Orthodox, with genuine love for God. We must understand that we do not yet love Him as we should, but we want to learn to love Him with our whole heart. May the Lord help us on this path and bless us. Amen.
