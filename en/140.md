# Why Cross & Do the Orthodox kill each other

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to continue speaking about the Cross, as we are still in the week of the veneration of the Cross. After this week, the remaining three weeks until Pascha will mark our ascent to Golgotha, together with Christ. This is the most sacred time of Lent, and it must become a model for our lives, for a true Christian is one who follows Christ to Golgotha. As He said, "If you want to be my disciple, take up your cross and follow me."

Today, we need to reflect deeply on the meaning of the Cross and what it means to follow Christ, as there are many misconceptions about the Cross in our time. Some believe that merely possessing a Cross solves all problems. We place Crosses everywhere—hanging them here and there—yet this often coexists with sin and even defiance of God’s will. For instance, I have seen churches, including Lutheran and Protestant ones, adorned with Crosses, yet they also display symbols of practices that contradict God’s commandments, such as the flag representing what led to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is perplexing how they reconcile these contradictions, and I wonder what god they truly worship. The Cross, however, is not a magical talisman or an amulet.

Another misconception is the excessive fear some have of trampling on a Cross. For example, when floor tiles form a cross-like pattern, some avoid stepping on them, fearing sacrilege. Yet, unless one deliberately creates a Cross on the floor, there is no need for such concern. The Cross is not merely an intersection of lines; it is a profound symbol of Christ’s sacrifice. This fear, though held by few, reflects a misunderstanding of the Cross’s true significance.

Many people consider themselves Christians but fail to grasp the essence of the Cross and are unwilling to follow Christ. Today, I want to discuss what it truly means to follow Christ and how we can draw life from the Cross, for it is a life-giving Cross. The Cross represents Christ’s passion, suffering, and death—the righteous One who died for our sins. To take up the Cross means to crucify our old self, as the Apostle Paul said: "The world has been crucified to me, and I to the world." This means that the sins, passions, and attractions of this world no longer hold power over us. They are nailed to the Cross, mortified, and put to death. This is why we fast and endure hardships—to cleanse ourselves of the old self and all that pertains to it.

To take up the Cross is to face suffering and not flee from it. When someone insults us, it is painful, but often this pain stems from our pride. We reject the insult, defending ourselves instead of accepting the Cross. Similarly, when someone suffers and asks for our help, but we turn away, unwilling to share their pain, we are refusing to take up our Cross. There are countless examples: betrayal, theft, loss, or even losing a job—all of these bring pain. How we receive this pain determines whether we accept it as our Cross. If we see it as a means to humble us, to lead us to repentance, and to make us better Christians, then we are truly taking up our Cross.

The Cross is not merely a symbol to be revered; it is a call to transformation. It challenges us to die to our old selves and rise anew in Christ. Let us embrace the Cross, not as an object of superstition, but as the path to eternal life. Amen.

You do not run away. However, not all pain is the same. Some pain merely leaves you stressed, angry, or complaining about life. This kind of sorrow leads to despair and, ultimately, to hell. It is not the sorrow that leads to salvation. There is a distinction between worldly sorrow and godly sorrow. 

We must also consider suffering that is not a consequence of our sins. Christ suffered, yet He was without sin. It is possible to suffer not because of wrongdoing but as a testimony for Christ. When others see Christ in you and reject you for it, when you suffer for speaking the truth or standing for righteousness, this too is a Cross. We must be willing to bear this kind of Cross for the sake of Christ, our faith, and the truth.

A powerful example of this is found in the story of the royal family of Russia, particularly Emperor Nicholas II and his family, who are now recognized as saints. After the Emperor was forced to abdicate the throne in 1917, the entire family, along with their loyal servants, was arrested. They endured torture, humiliation, imprisonment, and ultimately, execution. These servants, too, were later canonized as saints. For over a year, they faced unimaginable suffering, knowing that death was likely their fate. 

During this time, a priest who served them recorded his observations. He noted how deeply they prayed, how every word of the liturgy resonated in their hearts as they knelt before God. They were walking toward their own Golgotha, fully aware of the sacrifice they were making. Their faith and devotion were unwavering, even in the face of death.

As we journey toward Golgotha with Christ during this Lenten season, we must adopt a similar mindset. We cannot hide in the comfort of our own little worlds—our routines, paychecks, vacations, and material possessions. While these may provide temporary security, they can also distract us from eternal life. Christ said, "Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it." To truly follow Him, we must be willing to let go of our attachment to worldly things and embrace the Cross.

For the royal family and their servants, earthly concerns became insignificant as they faced their Golgotha. Similarly, we must learn to care less about material possessions and more about our spiritual journey. One saint, for example, lived with only two pieces of clothing, washing and alternating them daily. In contrast, many of us are consumed by the desire for more—more clothes, more possessions, more comfort. We must make a conscious decision to walk with Christ toward Golgotha, not as a distant possibility but as a present reality. This mindset must shape our entire lives.

Of course, this is not easy. It is an ideal that requires time, effort, and openness to God’s work in our hearts. We must allow the Lord to transform us, to prepare us to take up our Cross. During this sacred time, we are called to grow firm in this commitment.

Finally, I want to address the current state of the world, as there are many accusations and conflicts unfolding. In times of turmoil, it is especially important to remain rooted in Christ and His teachings. The Cross reminds us that suffering and sacrifice are part of our journey, but they are not without purpose. Let us strive to bear our Crosses with faith, humility, and love, trusting in the life-giving power of Christ’s sacrifice. Amen.

People often ask, "You are Orthodox. Why is there war? Why do you kill each other? Where is the church? Why don’t the pastors do anything? Why didn’t they act?" These questions arise, especially in times of conflict and suffering. Let me address this with clarity and truth.

Looking back at the time of the martyrs I mentioned earlier—the royal family and their servants—we see that the Bolshevik revolution and the horrors that followed occurred partly because we, as pastors, did not do enough. But it was not solely our failure. There were deeper, more complex reasons for what happened. After the revolution, those who were willing to take up their Cross and follow Christ were persecuted and killed. The majority of the population, however, chose the deception of Mammon—the promise of a bright future, progress, science, industry, and a comfortable life in this world. This was a lie from the devil, and it led them to reject Christ and His teachings. As a result, the entire society—Russia, Ukraine, and others—was led down a wide road to hell. They were deceived.

When the Church eventually regained some freedom, it was small and weak, struggling to pull people back to the truth. It is not easy to undo decades of deception and spiritual decline. Simply calling oneself Orthodox does not mean one has truly taken up their Cross to follow Christ. This is a difficult path, and many are unwilling to walk it. Even if you are a saint or a genius, not everyone will follow you. The majority of people—perhaps more than 90%—are not willing to forsake the allure of Mammon and embrace the Cross. This is true not only in Russia and Ukraine but everywhere in the world, perhaps even more so elsewhere.

As pastors, we must acknowledge that we have not done enough in terms of pastoral care and mission work. This is our responsibility, and we must strive to do better. However, the current state of affairs is not solely due to our shortcomings. It is not a matter of Orthodox killing Orthodox. Rather, it is people who call themselves Orthodox but do not truly live by the teachings of Christ. Many are deceived by the devil, swayed by agendas that have little to do with the Cross and Golgotha—whether it be nationalism, the promise of a strong empire, or other worldly ideals.

Even among pastors, there are those who are misled or confused by the complexities of the situation. Not everyone understands what is happening or why. When a Christian leader—a pastor, a patriarch, or anyone—speaks to secular people or those who claim to be Orthodox but do not truly care, their words are often evaluated through the lens of worldly values. These individuals may listen, but they prioritize their own beliefs, shaped by what they hear on TV or through other secular influences. Whether their values are patriotic, nationalistic, liberal, or something else, they judge everything based on these standards, not on the teachings of Christ.

We cannot be held responsible for the choices of an entire society that refuses to carry the Cross. Our responsibility lies in our mission work, pastoral care, and faithfulness to Christ’s teachings. We must do better in these areas, but we cannot control the decisions of governments or societies. Some ask, "Why didn’t the patriarch speak to Putin or influence his decisions?" The reality is that such influence is limited. While Christian leaders can and should speak truth to power, the decisions of rulers are often shaped by political, economic, and social factors beyond the Church’s control.

In these challenging times, we must remain steadfast in our faith, committed to the Cross, and dedicated to sharing the Gospel. We must pray for wisdom, courage, and humility as we navigate these complexities. Let us not lose hope but continue to bear witness to Christ, even in the face of adversity. The Cross reminds us that suffering and sacrifice are part of our journey, but they are not without purpose. Through Christ, we find hope, redemption, and the promise of eternal life. Amen.

In the future, the world will increasingly embrace the agenda of Mammon—whether it is called the "Great Reset" or something else—and will move in that direction. We must remember that Mammon always hates Christ. It may disguise itself as friendly or openly attack the Church, but its opposition to Christ and the true Cross will remain constant. 

For us, the path forward begins with ourselves. Each of us must learn how to follow Christ, how to walk the narrow path, and how to take up our Cross with joy. The Cross is not meant to destroy us but to mortify our old self—our passions, sins, and all the filth within us. Through this process, we become healthy, strong, free, and wise, able to withstand evil and remain steadfast in faith. This is God’s work in us, for He desires what is truly good for us, even if it is not what we might choose for ourselves. 

By embracing the Cross, we anchor ourselves in salvation and stand firm on the rock of faith. No matter what happens in the world, the Lord will bring us to His kingdom. Our calling is to be true witnesses of Christ, willing and eager to carry our Cross. We must even be prepared to take up a heavier Cross if the Lord allows, following the example of the martyrs during the Bolshevik era. 

Let us be inspired by their courage and faithfulness, not by the actions of those who persecuted them. There are always two motivations at play: the motivation of those who are crucified for Christ and the motivation of those who crucify others. We must choose the side of those who are willing to suffer for the truth, standing firmly with them in spirit and in action. 

During this sacred time, let us draw closer to Christ, stepping firmly onto the path of salvation. Let us walk with our Lord to Golgotha, embracing the Cross as our guide and our strength. Let us pray for the world, even for those who hurt, persecute, or kill us, and let us strive to be a light in the darkness. Through the Cross, we find true life, and through Christ, we find eternal victory. Amen.
