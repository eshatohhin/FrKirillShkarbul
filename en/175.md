# “Both in tranquility and in tempest”  what is coming

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a world that is shaking. If we compare it to 50 years ago, it seems that time was much more peaceful, with fewer revolutions and wars. Now, especially in the last two years and this year, we face sicknesses, war, the risk of famine, economic crises, and a recent financial meltdown. People are talking about nuclear weapons, their potential use, and the possibility of a third world war—some say it has already begun, while others believe it will start soon. In any case, there is great uncertainty about the future and a lack of stability.

How does this relate to our spiritual life and our faith? For many, it is tempting to separate these two realms—to focus solely on theology, divine scripture, and prayer, creating a peaceful, isolated world distinct from the fallen world of news and politics. This is one extreme, as it overlooks the historical significance of the coming of Jesus Christ. He did not come merely to offer teachings or methods for self-purification and sanctity; He gave the Church a mission. This mission involves ministering to the world, transforming it, and being at the center of its history. The existence of this world revolves around the Church, for the Lord’s true people, the new Israel, are what matter most to Him. Eventually, this world will end, and its fate is deeply connected to our faith. Thus, the history of the world is intertwined with the history of the Church, the life of the Church, and the life of each of us.

Our personal spiritual lives and struggles are closely tied to the broader context of what is happening in the world—what we face and what is unfolding. This is why many Holy Fathers reflected on the Antichrist and pondered history and the rise and fall of monarchs. Even when holy individuals wrote epistles or books, they did not do so merely to address political agendas. They wrote to address the current challenges faced by Christians while ensuring their words remained relevant for believers of any generation, country, or time.

When I speak about current events, I am not seeking popularity or trying to gain more likes by aligning with political issues. If a war breaks out and I make a video about it, I do not care about the likes or attention. Rather, when I consider what is happening in the world, I hope we can draw spiritual lessons from these events and discern what we should do. These lessons can be applied at any time, ensuring they remain timeless. For example, the Revelation of St. John was written during a time of Christian persecution, and much of what he wrote relates to the historical context of the Church in his era. Yet, it also speaks to the Church’s journey in every age and historical setting.

Today, I want to reflect on what we are facing now and what may happen soon. There is a remarkable book written by the modern saint, Eugene (or Eugenie) Poisilani, an Orthodox writer who lived at the end of the 19th century and the first three decades of the 20th century. He was martyred, killed by the Bolsheviks in 1931. During his life, he wrote extensively on faith amid the turmoil of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, the Red Terror, and other tragic events in the Soviet Union. These events bear parallels to what is happening today.

What he wrote provides us with profound inspiration and insight into living a Christian life in troubled times. One of his books, written in 1916, is titled *In Quietness and in the Tempest*. It emphasizes the need for unwavering loyalty and faithfulness to the Lord, both in times of peace and in times of war, in calm and in turmoil. For a Christian, there is no true time of peace; spiritual warfare is constant. If you believe you have found a peaceful existence, a state of spiritual tranquility where everything is fine, and you feel no need to pray or fast, it means you are falling asleep. You are losing the vigilance and guidance the Lord provides. This is the worst thing that can happen to a Christian, especially one who had begun to awaken but then drifted back into complacency.

This spiritual warfare becomes even more pronounced during times of external conflict and upheaval, such as the wars and tempests we face today. The world is shaking with sickness, wars, and crises, especially in the last two years and even more so this year. Greater turmoil may lie ahead, with many warning of the potential use of nuclear weapons or the outbreak of a third world war. The situation could become far worse than it is now, and we must be prepared for anything in terms of external conflict. However, an even greater challenge will be the temptation and deception that follow such turmoil.

The Lord, in His prophecy, spoke of wars, earthquakes, betrayal among families, and civil strife as the "beginning of sorrows"—like the pains of a woman in labor. These pains signify the birth of something new. But what will be born in this world? Ultimately, it will be the kingdom of the Antichrist. Those who seek to build this "joyful new world" envision a peaceful society, but it will not tolerate true Christianity. There will be no place for holiness, righteousness, or genuine spiritual freedom. It will demand complete conformity to its ideology. Some of you may have read George Orwell’s *1984*, which depicts a world where you must love the system or face elimination. This is the culture of elimination, already underway. The Antichrist has always sought to eliminate the Church, whether in the Roman Empire, the Bolshevik Soviet Union, or elsewhere. But the future kingdom of the Antichrist will be far more comprehensive, and we are moving toward it step by step.

The greatest danger is that they will make it seem natural for you to flow into this new world. For example, today, most people are dependent on gadgets—constantly checking messages, seeking news, and becoming addicted to platforms like Facebook. This is a crucial step toward being linked to the future system. You will become so accustomed to it that you cannot imagine living without it. It will feel essential, natural, and indispensable. You will be unable to sacrifice this connection for anything, even if it means betraying your faith and Christ. Otherwise, you will be canceled—cut off from society, declared an outlaw, or even physically annihilated. We already see this happening: those who speak against the system are silenced, ostracized, or punished. 

In such times, we must remain vigilant, rooted in our faith, and prepared to resist the temptations and deceptions of the coming age. The spiritual battle is real, and our faithfulness to Christ must remain unwavering, no matter the cost.

There was a movie called *Enemy of the State*—perhaps you’ve seen it. What is coming will be far worse. In the future, it will be much, much worse. The goal is to make it so natural for you to assimilate into this new system that you won’t even think, “Oh, this new ideology, this new dictator—I don’t want this.” Instead, you will want it. They are already canceling countries and cultures. For example, everything related to Russia is being canceled now, driven by government actions. If you resist, your future will be canceled. You will have no future. 

In the Soviet Union, for instance, if you were a practicing Christian, a priest, or openly faithful, you had no future. In the 1920s and 1930s, they created a world where there was no place for you if you did not conform. In the future, it will be even worse—even hidden Christians will not be able to escape. There will be no privacy. Your thoughts, your actions, everything will be exposed and known to the Antichrist or to artificial intelligence systems. This is what is coming, and we must prepare for it.

How do we prepare? We must understand that two kingdoms are developing simultaneously. Recall Augustine’s *City of God* and the city of this world. The kingdom of evil is growing, manifesting in various forms—socialism, communism, capitalism, different nations, ideologies, and conflicts. Whether it’s Russia, Ukraine, the East, the West, or China, all are contributing to the construction of a new Babylon. 

At the same time, another kingdom is growing—the kingdom of Jesus, the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven. This kingdom is developing in our hearts. We draw from the Church’s 2,000 years of spiritual wisdom and experience. Our faith grows stronger as we are cleansed from sin and passions, because we love Jesus and righteousness. As we choose this path, the external kingdom becomes increasingly foreign and unappealing to us. We place no hope in ideologies, ethnic identities, or nationalistic pride. These things are either external to us or represent a form of domination. If something is associated with sin—whether carnal, ideological, or spiritual—we feel its oppressive weight. 

Like a righteous person or an innocent child who recoils from foul language or sinful behavior, we must cultivate a similar aversion to the deceptions and seductions of this world. We must nurture in our hearts a clear distinction between the kingdom of heaven and the external world with its vainglory, selfishness, and carnal pleasures. For us, there should be nothing appealing in these things. This distinction must become clearer and more evident in our lives each day. We need a spiritual vaccine in our hearts and minds to protect us from these temptations.

How do we achieve this? Through prayer, unwavering and persistent. We must never give up, never fall into despair, never say, “Prayer doesn’t work,” or “I’m too lazy.” We must continue to pray, participate in the Holy Eucharist, immerse ourselves in Holy Scripture, and study the works of the Holy Fathers and saints. By doing so, we become more deeply attached to the world of Christ. Only in this way can we avoid the future deception that is coming. 

This is our path—to grow in faith, to detach from the fleeting and sinful allure of this world, and to anchor ourselves firmly in the kingdom of God. Only then will we be prepared for the challenges ahead.

Because what is coming will be far worse than anything we have seen in the past. We remember how, not long ago, nearly 99% of the people in the Soviet Union—even those who were Christians the day before—embraced the promises of a bright new world built through industrialization and other grand plans. It will be the same in the future. Perhaps 99%, or even more, will embrace the new world they are planning to build—the world of the Antichrist. 

Let us keep this in mind. Let us, day by day, grow stronger, achieve victories in our spiritual warfare, and draw closer to Jesus Christ. We must be ready for whatever comes. The tension, the war, the gap between our kingdom and the external kingdom will become more and more evident to us, not just intellectually but in our hearts as well. 

True Christians—not the fake ones, of whom there will be many—will be persecuted and squeezed out. It will be like working in a large corporation where you speak the truth and refuse to comply with the system. While others care only about their paychecks, efficiency, or self-interest, you care about truth. As a result, you will be hated by everyone around you because your paradigm is radically different from theirs. The same will be true for Christians in the coming world. We will be different, fundamentally different, and we will not accept what they are offering.

Let us stand firm in the truth. Let us remain loyal and faithful to the Lord, whether in times of peace or in the midst of thunder and tempest. No matter what happens, we will stay with Him to the end. 

Amen. God bless.
