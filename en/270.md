# Why many are deaf to hearing God

Dear brothers and sisters, we are still celebrating the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos, and the color blue symbolizes the purity of heart and life of Mother Mary, just as the sky is blue. So, we continue in this celebration, and today I want to elaborate on something I mentioned in my last video: spiritual blindness. This is a very important topic because it is the key to understanding several problems.

There are three types of problems that arise from spiritual blindness. The first is disbelief. When people do not believe in obvious truths—you tell them about God, about Christ, about virtue—but they either do not believe, believe something else, or even say "yes, yes," yet they do not change and continue to live in their wrong ways. Or they may believe in some absurd ideas—atheism, some strange philosophy, Buddhism, Hinduism, paganism, sects, Scientology, or other nonsensical and garbage beliefs. It is obvious that these are false, yet for some reason, they still cling to them.

The second problem is wrong belief, or crooked belief, which is non-Orthodox and heretical. You might believe in Christ, but not in the true Christ. You might believe in the Pope, or you might believe that there is no true Church, that there are thousands of different churches, and that there are no sacraments, even though Christ Himself said, "Whoever does not eat my flesh and drink my blood has no life in them." Yet, people still refuse to believe and instead adhere to heresies. This is another significant problem.

The third problem, which often affects us as Orthodox Christians, is a lack of faith. In difficult moments, we falter, we sin, we fall into despondency, or we become lukewarm in our faith. We may pretend to be faithful, but we do not live according to our faith. We do not pray, we do not fast, we are afraid of many things, and we do not trust God. This is a lack of faith. We may believe in Christ, but our belief is incomplete. This is not full blindness, but it is very close and can lead to complete spiritual blindness.

So, what is this blindness, where does it come from, and what can we do about it? Do we simply say, "Oh, these people are predestined for destruction; they love error, they love darkness, so be it"? Or can we do something about it? First, we need to understand what this blindness is all about because this understanding will influence how we approach overcoming it and how people can emerge from this blindness. Perhaps merely saying many things is not enough; maybe we need to take a different approach.

First, let us turn to the Gospel of John, chapter 8, verses 42-47. Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own, but he sent me."

"Why do you not understand my speech? It is because you cannot hear my word." Here, Saint Hippolytus of Rome, a Holy Father of the 3rd century, explains that Jesus does not say, "You do not want to hear my word, my voice," but rather, "You cannot hear my word." You are unable; you lack the ability to hear my word. What does this mean? What is their failure? Is it not their problem? Are they not guilty if they cannot hear? Well, no—they are guilty. To understand why they cannot, let us read the remainder of this passage.

Verse 44 states: "You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears God's words. The reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God."

These people are not of God; they are not God's people. Why? Because they do the desires of their father, the devil. This is the reason. As soon as people do the will of the devil, they lose the ability to hear the word of God. When we sin, when we do not fast, when we live according to the flesh, we lose the ability to hear God's will. This is the key reason. We will love darkness more and more; we will love our old selves. This is why all heretics are against true fasting and repentance. They do not like fasting; they do not like repentance. They are not repentant sinners. They think they are holy, justified, and that everything is fine. But the Lord came to call sinners to repentance. Remember, these are the ones to whom the Lord came.

To better understand these things, let us also look at the Gospel of John, chapter 12, verses 36-40. The Lord says: "While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light." After saying these things, Jesus departed and hid Himself from them. Though He had done so many miracles before them, they still did not believe in Him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet, who said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" Therefore, they could not believe, because Isaiah also said: "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their hearts, and turn, so that I should heal them."

We see that people, including us—every one of us—tend toward darkness. We tend to love darkness. And what is this darkness? For some, it is a sinful life—hedonism, living for enjoyment. "Have a nice day," they say, focusing on drinking, eating, traveling, shopping, nice music—everything for self-satisfaction, including their families. It is all about "me," about enjoyment. For others, it may be false teachings or philosophies—Heidegger or something else—another form of darkness. Or perhaps it is a hobby that consumes them, something they want to do all day. This, too, is darkness.

Or perhaps you are immersed in art—spending every day in the theater, listening to all kinds of music, or dedicating yourself to science, researching, writing papers. This becomes everything to you. You have no time, no willingness to pray or communicate with the Lord. These pursuits become your idols. All of this is just different forms of idol worship. Maybe you are building something—a nice house, decorating your home, or passionately involved in a project. Perhaps it is literature, fiction, movies, bloggers, chats, or similar distractions. You are completely absorbed in it. That is darkness. You love darkness more than light, and it will completely blind you. You will not be able to hear the word of God, nor will you be willing to pray, repent, or seek the truth. It is not that you choose not to want these things; you will simply be unable. Even when you hear the truth, you will reject it. You will bounce back.

Therefore, let us be very careful. This is why the Lord stressed vigilance: "Be vigilant." You must know what is happening in your heart. Is it drifting away? Is your faith weakening? We need to love fasting, self-sacrifice, and living the Gospel—not just knowing or learning it, but truly living it. Often, if you want to help someone overcome this blindness, it is not enough to simply speak words. Yes, sometimes you need to witness with your words, but it is far more important to show the example of your life. How has your life changed? What does it mean that you now love others more than yourself? Are you ready to sacrifice yourself for others? Do you help them? Do you sacrifice your time and energy selflessly? Do you love your enemies? Do you let go of the wrongs others have done to you? Is this real in your life? People are waiting for such examples. If they do not see it, they will not be convinced. They will not be willing to try to change their own lives, to turn away from serving demons.

On a larger scale, this is how mammon accomplishes its goals and agendas. But this is something I will discuss later. Today, I want each of you to think deeply about this darkness, this spiritual blindness. You may have diplomas—we may have all the diplomas in the world—but we can still be as blind as anyone. This is the reality. May the Lord help us rid ourselves of this blindness, strengthen our faith, fill our hearts with love, and give us the willingness to serve Him no matter what. Let us strive to remove all darkness from our hearts. There is still darkness in each of us, and we must set this goal: to rid ourselves of all darkness completely, without remainder. Whether through suffering, fasting, pain, or anything else, we must be willing. May the Lord help us, strengthen us in our faith, and cleanse us from every impurity. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
