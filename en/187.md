# Orthodoxy in Singapore and SE Asia

Dear brothers and sisters, I recently embarked on a new mission trip and today I find myself at the airport in Singapore. I have spent almost the entire day here—more than seven hours—and I am now heading to another destination. However, I won’t reveal where I’m going just yet; that will be the focus of my next video. 

Today, I want to share with you about the Church in Singapore, as the development of this mission here has been quite recent. I witnessed how it grew from nothing to what it is today. Singapore is now the center of the good metropolitan or metropolis of Singapore, encompassing all of Southeast Asia, parts of East Asia, including Korea, and even some countries in Oceania. It’s a vast area covering many nations. Recently, it was divided into four dioceses, which is even better because we now have four bishops—though, admittedly, the situation has become more complicated than that.

It’s important to emphasize how valuable it is to have a bishop who can develop a mission in a specific region. For instance, if you are far away, like we are in Taiwan, having a bishop in Moscow makes regular communication and receiving care and support quite challenging. For many years, it was our hope that in this Asian region—Southeast Asia and beyond—there would be a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church. Historically, the Russian Orthodox Church had only eight dioceses outside the former Soviet Union, all located in Europe and the Americas. There was nothing in Asia, which was quite strange given Russia’s significant presence on the Asian continent. This lack of a diocese made mission development in Asia much more difficult, especially since the need for mission work here is even greater than in Europe or the United States. 

So, for many years, it was our dream to establish a diocese in this region. Let me share a bit about how this came to be. I first came to this region in 2004, arriving in Hong Kong almost 20 years ago. At that time, there was no diocese here, and in Singapore, there was nothing Orthodox—no Russian presence, no Orthodox Church at all, as far as I know. However, more than 10 years ago, a small community was established in Singapore, similar to what we have in Taiwan. This community grew under the guidance of Bishop Sergei of Seoul, who was responsible for its development. He also established two communities in Malaysia at the time. For several years, the community remained small and simple, gathering in very basic places, such as a garage converted into a church. It was a challenging time, but with the Lord’s help, it grew into something much larger.

Let me share how this transformation happened—it’s truly a miracle of the Lord working in our times. In 2013, we began a mission in the Philippines. I was sent there to provide aid after Typhoon Yolanda, a devastating storm. Very quickly, we saw a significant response, with around 3,000 people expressing a desire to become Orthodox. I was in charge of that project because Taiwan was close by, and at the time, there was no diocese in the region, making mission development extremely difficult. About two years later, around 2015, Bishop Sergei was sent to the Philippines on a delegation to visit the people and bring blessings from the patriarch.

At that time, during lunch in one of the villages, Bishop Sergei shared with me that there were plans to establish a diocese in this region due to the great need for it. Many communities were scattered, lacking coordination and support. They needed proper church structures to unite and function smoothly. He expressed his vision that Singapore should become the center of this diocese. Soon after, around one or two years later—I believe it was 2016—a structure called the Administration of the Patriarchal Parishes in Southeast Asia was formed. This included all the parishes in the region, except for Taiwan and China, which, for various reasons, were not part of this diocese. However, all other parishes in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and elsewhere were united under this new administrative structure, which acted as a secretariat to oversee and support these communities.

By the end of 2018, the official Diocese of Singapore and Southeast Asia was established, with Metropolitan Sergei at its helm. This marked a significant step forward in developing the mission further. One of the key reasons for establishing this diocese was the growing number of conversions in the Philippines. Many locals in the region expressed a desire to join the Russian Orthodox Church, with some even aspiring to become priests. This growing interest and the need for proper oversight led the Church to establish the diocese. In a way, our mission in the Philippines played a crucial role in the formation of this larger metropolitan structure in Singapore.

Later, around 2019, the diocese expanded further and was elevated to a metropolitanate, which was then divided into four dioceses to provide greater administrative support to the growing number of communities across the region. These four dioceses were as follows:  
1. The first, centered in Singapore, was responsible for Indonesia and Malaysia.  
2. The second, based in Manila, oversaw the Philippines and Vietnam.  
3. The third covered Thailand and neighboring countries, including Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar.  
4. The fourth was responsible for Korea.  

This was a monumental development. Suddenly, we had a well-organized structure with multiple bishops providing support to communities across a vast region. It was a tremendous blessing.

Two years ago, in 2020, during the global health crisis, another significant development occurred. My mission trips to East Timor and Papua New Guinea bore fruit, with many people converting to Orthodoxy. The Church recognized this growth and included these two countries within the metropolitanate of Southeast Asia, extending its reach into Oceania. This expansion opened up a new frontier for the mission, making it even larger and more impactful.

We are deeply thankful to the Lord for these developments. Although I am no longer directly involved in this mission—as I am now heading to a country outside this region—it is still heartening to be here in Singapore and witness the fruits of our efforts. Singapore, as an economic hub, is also a convenient location for travel, with direct flights to many places, including East Timor. The airport where I am now is incredibly well-connected, making it an ideal base for bringing together the East and the West. It’s a testament to how the mission continues to grow and thrive, and I am grateful to see the Lord’s work unfolding in this way.

This meeting place provides the Church with a tremendous opportunity to share the message and testimony of the faith with people across this vast region—Southeast Asia, Oceania, and beyond. It serves as a bridge to bring the Gospel to many who might otherwise not hear it. 

Please keep these missions in your prayers, and I also ask for your prayers that my own mission trip may be successful. May the Lord bless you all. Amen.
