# Who is Leviathan, and where is he

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about the Leviathan, a topic that is not often emphasized. Some people ask why I'm talking about all this apocalyptic, demonic stuff. Why not talk about Christ, the gospel, and love? Well, the closer we come to Christ, the more evident the fake Christ becomes. And the more obvious the evil in this world becomes to us.

When we naively say, "Everything is good, just love people, just smile, okay? There is no devil, there is no Leviathan," that means we don't truly know God. We don't really know who Christ is. Because Christ Himself, the apostles, and the holy fathers often spoke about the dangers that come disguised as something nice.

The problem is not that we talk about the Leviathan. The problem is that some people make it a phobia; they are afraid of the Leviathan, and that's the issue. But we are not afraid of any evil. We are not afraid. We fear only God and His punishment for sin. Everything else, for us Christians, is nothing. We have no fear.

The concept of the Leviathan comes from the Old Testament, primarily in the book of Job, chapter 41, where we have a description of the Leviathan. Prior to that, Behemoth is mentioned. Behemoth and the Leviathan are closely related. The Leviathan is also mentioned in Psalms and in the prophet Isaiah. But Job is most important because it provides us with much more insight into the Leviathan.

Modern liberal interpretations often turn this into some rosy fairy tale: "Oh, God is showing Job Behemoth, see this animal. And then He shows him a crocodile, the Leviathan, look at this animal." And it's portrayed as if it's just a nice biology lesson. But it's not about that. The book of Job gives us great insight into who the devil is—and not just the devil. The Leviathan is not exactly the devil, though it is closely related.

All the holy fathers tell us that it is talking about, let's say, the incarnation of the devil in this world. It has this personalization, this personification, as if it is one entity acting in the world. You might say, "It's a creation by the Lord." Well, we can say that the whole book of Job comes from ancient times, probably before Moses. Regardless of when the book was written, we believe it is historical, and these events happened before Moses.

Whether the concept of the Leviathan comes from those days or whether the understanding of this concept comes from the time it was recorded is not so important. However, the whole understanding of the devil in the Old Testament is not exactly the same as when the Lord Jesus Christ gave us the full understanding that the devil is the enemy. There is no compromise between us and him, between God and him. There is nothing positive about the devil. He is the killer and destroyer of human souls and bodies—souls in terms of corrupting them.

Yes, in the Old Testament, the Leviathan is not portrayed as negatively as we might expect. However, everything is there. It is inspired by the Holy Spirit, so everything is there. The holy fathers saw everything in the book of Job about the Leviathan as pertaining to the devil as we know him to be.

So, don't be fooled. Don't think, "Oh, it's just a creature, and God is playing with this creature to achieve some goals in this world." No, this is actually a Talmudic understanding, completely foreign to Christian tradition. In Judaism, the Leviathan is understood differently. There are various interpretations within Judaism of the Leviathan, but generally, they tend to be more positive. In Talmudic Judaism, there is no evil per se. Evil is just the flip side of good, and both are considered good because they are useful. This brings us to the Luciferian doctrine of dualism and monism.

It’s all one, but it has two sides, like yin and yang in Chinese philosophy. But that’s a whole different topic. These are Luciferian ideas that have seeped into the Talmud, Kabbalah, and many teachings of Judaism. However, we are talking about Christianity, and the Christian understanding is the true understanding. Don’t be mistaken.

To put it simply, the Leviathan is a spiritual entity—an evil spirit—connected to humans who are controlled, manipulated, and driven by the devil. It is also connected to the social and technological systems and institutions that support the devil’s agenda in this world. I don’t know if this sounds too complicated, but this is what it is. It is one entity, though it may appear to have opposing forces. We have capitalism, socialism, liberals, conservatives, economic booms, economic recessions, bull markets, bear markets, democratic governments, authoritarian governments—it seems like there are opposing forces at play. But no, all of this is like a snake. The Leviathan is a snake, always moving back and forth.

The image of the Leviathan, whether it’s depicted as a crocodile, a fish, or some other creature, doesn’t really matter. Some holy fathers say that Behemoth, Leviathan, and even a bird represent different facets of the same entity. Behemoth, with its strong, destructive steps, symbolizes the brutal force of sin, destroying human souls and everything in its path. It’s clumsy, crazy, and relentless—it just goes and does what it wants. That’s one facet of the Leviathan.

Another facet is its treacherous, deceptive nature. It’s always shifting, never straightforward, always hiding in the grass. You never know what it truly is. This is why, for example, during Soviet times, fervent supporters of socialism overnight became so-called democrats, advocates of market economies, and businessmen. They flipped and flopped just like that. The same happened with the Nazis and other ideologies—it’s all about conformism.

The bird represents the superficiality of the ideas the Leviathan uses. For example, the music or spiritual concepts associated with the Leviathan are shallow and lack substance. This is symbolized by the image of birds. This interpretation isn’t mine—it comes from the holy fathers.

They also explain the skin or scales of the Leviathan, like those of a fish. These scales represent the masses—blind, manipulated people who follow orders without question. They are told to go to war, and they go to war. They are told to go shopping, and they go shopping. They are told to sin, and they sin. This blind force is like the skin of the Leviathan, and it’s very hard to penetrate. It seems so tightly knit that even air cannot pass through. Sometimes, it appears that people are so united in their pursuit of sin, their blindness, and their stupidity, that nothing can be done to stop them.

The head of the Leviathan represents the ideologists—those who lead the flock in the direction they want. These are the behind-the-scenes manipulators, the puppet masters who are connected to the devil through occultism, magic, Kabbalah, and other dark practices. They use technology, social systems, and economic tools to ensure everything moves in the direction they desire.

In summary, the Leviathan is a complex, multifaceted entity that embodies the spiritual, social, and systemic forces of evil in the world. It is not just a single creature or idea but a pervasive force that operates through deception, manipulation, and conformity. The Christian understanding of this is clear: the Leviathan is a manifestation of the devil’s work, and we must remain vigilant and rooted in the truth of Christ to resist its influence.

Having said all of this, you might think that the Leviathan is something far away—something tied to economies, brainwashing technocrats, tyrants, or authoritarian governments. But no, it’s actually not that far. The Leviathan is sometimes portrayed as a python circling a city, creating a state of comfort and stability. This is the so-called "world of comfort." Why do we have so few missionaries? Why are so few people willing to become priests, engage in social service, or do something for Christ? Because such actions disrupt the comfortable life—a life where you earn just enough to meet your needs, where everything runs smoothly, where you surround yourself only with people you like, and where you create a safe, predictable world. This is the Leviathan. This is mammon. The Lord warned us about mammon, about the prince of this world. This is all about the Leviathan.

And it’s not far away. In fact, every addiction, every bad habit, every weakness we have is a surrender to the Leviathan. We embrace it, we take it inside us, and it lives within us—through our concepts, our weaknesses, our passions. The Leviathan is in us, not somewhere distant. This is the big problem. In ancient times, the Leviathan took one form; in the Middle Ages, another. It’s the same Leviathan, but it adapts to different eras. In Catholicism, it took one shape; in Protestantism, another. The industrial revolution brought a new level of the Leviathan, and now, with the digital and AI revolution, we face yet another level of control. Even with distance learning and remote work, people are becoming more isolated, more closed off in their own cells, making it easier for the Leviathan to consume them.

In the book of Revelation, chapter 13, we read about two beasts: one rising from the sea and another from the earth. The beast from the sea is also related to the Leviathan—a manifestation of it, with seven heads. In ancient times, the Leviathan was depicted with seven heads, though no crocodile has seven heads. The book of Job describes the Leviathan in ways that go beyond any natural creature: the water boils around it, no weapon can harm it, and it is called the "king of all the children of pride." Who is the king of the proud? The devil himself. He fell because of his pride, desiring to be like God, to have power and dominion. All who are proud become slaves and ministers of the Leviathan.

So, let us be aware of these things. The more we love pride, the more we feed the Leviathan. The more we see the Leviathan in ourselves and in the world around us, the more we must hate it and strive to be free from it. Whether it comes through technology, sinful living, or false ideologies, we must seek freedom from the Leviathan. We must overthrow the dragon. Christ gives us everything we need to do this. There is nothing to fear. As long as we live with Christ, surrender ourselves to Him, we can trample the Leviathan underfoot.

May the Lord grant us victory and keep us safe from all evil. God bless.
