# 7 “Resets” of America

Dear brothers and sisters, today I'm recording my last video in the United States before I go back to Taiwan. Behind me are the hills of Hollywood, and I want to say a few words about my overall conclusions regarding what is going on here and what is coming. I should begin by saying that the United States is a great country, and I love the United States and the Americans. I don't want to criticize. The only thing we need to consider is what is happening here spiritually. Many people call America "New Babylon." Well, I think New Babylon is here—it's in people's minds, and not only here, but in all countries across the world. However, the United States, at this moment, is being used as an instrument of the prince of this world to establish his order and change the world the way he wants. We need to think: How did this all happen? How did we get to this point? If we understand what's going on and what's happening, it's easier for us to avoid mistakes and not be misled by certain things. So today, I want to share some thoughts on what has happened here on this land. What is this phenomenon of the United States?

First of all, everything started with people coming here from Europe. They came for a better life, for freedom, for opportunities to develop, and to escape the restrictions and persecutions they faced in Europe. Europe had many limitations—limited resources, persecution of those who thought differently, and various restrictions. People came here to grow and to develop. This reminds us of what happened with Adam and Eve when they sinned. Satan told them, "You will be like gods. You will be free. You will have your own world." That was the temptation. Eve thought, "Adam and I have fruits, we have everything. Why do we need to obey some god? We can just have our own world here." That was the temptation, and this aligns with what has happened here. Of course, the people who moved here were not running away from God per se, though you could argue that in some sense they were, as they did not want to face the problems back in Europe. They tried to break free, but let's not discuss that now. Essentially, they wanted to establish something new here, and to make this possible, the principle of tolerance became key in the United States. The idea was: I don't tell anyone how they should live, what religion to follow, or what views to hold. Everyone has their own ideas—just obey the law and don't interfere with others. In the spiritual world, this is akin to saying, if something is spoiled, you don't tell them it's spoiled. Let them become even more spoiled, and they won't tell you that you are spoiled. Everyone becomes more and more spoiled that way. This principle of an atomized world—where I just mind my own business, have my own household, own guns for protection, and don't interfere with others—became key in the United States. This allowed the search for "my own world" to be possible. This idea, at its core, is anti-Christian.

However, the people who came here were still Christians, and they were fervent Christians. They went to church, worked hard to make their dreams come true, and were very laborious. They held traditional Christian values in terms of family and social life. Families were strong, with many children, and people worked long hours without complaint. They were loyal to their employers, loyal to their country, and ready to die for their country. It was a noble and praiseworthy culture that existed in the United States all the way until the second half of the 20th century. That's when everything began to break apart. Now, we need to see how this happened.

Now we're talking about the Great Reset—the idea that the whole world is moving toward a major transformation. Of course, this is happening here in the United States as well. But this Great Reset, this revolution of our times, was preceded by a series of resets that brought America to where it is now. I want to provide a very brief overview of these resets, focusing on the major ones. There are many more, but I’ll highlight the most significant ones. I hope it won’t be too tiresome.

I distinguish six major resets. We won’t include the first one, which was when America gained independence and became a country. You could say that was the first reset. The second reset was the war with Spain, during which many states joined the Union, and America expanded significantly. Alaska was acquired, and California was ceded to the United States by Russia. This marked a second major development, making America a large and powerful country. The third reset was the Civil War in the 1860s, when the North imposed its capitalist system on the South. The South had been less individualistic and less profit-oriented before, but even now, the values remain quite different. The North conquered the South, and the entire country adopted a system of fierce competitive capitalism—where everyone fights for themselves.

The fourth reset occurred in 1913 with the establishment of the Federal Reserve System (FRS). At this point, control over the printing of the dollar was placed in the hands of a private group of people, rather than the government. This group held values that were not aligned with national interests. The Federal Reserve, which remains a private institution to this day, gained control over the finances of the United States and, by extension, much of the world, since the US dollar is the global reserve currency. Around the same time, World War I broke out, further consolidating power and wealth in the hands of this group. This period also saw the rise of more socialist tendencies, as greater control was exerted over the economy.

The fifth reset was the Great Depression of 1929, when the stock market crashed, people lost their savings, and widespread hunger and unemployment ensued. It was a time of war and extreme hardship, both in the United States and globally. Many lives were lost, and the experience left a lasting impact on the American mindset. People began to prioritize earning and saving more money to avoid such catastrophes in the future. This led to a culture of overconsumption, driven by the fear of scarcity and hunger. This mindset persists to this day, though it is now being challenged by the current reset. After the Great Depression, the United States emerged as the dominant global power, surpassing Britain and becoming the hegemon of the capitalist world.

The sixth major reset took place in the 1970s with the rise of postmodernism. Before this period, Americans were hardworking, family-oriented, and willing to sacrifice for their country. However, the 1970s brought a cultural shift toward a more relaxed, hippie lifestyle. The emphasis shifted from hard work and discipline to enjoying life, hanging out, and rejecting traditional values. Production was outsourced to Southeast Asia, and a new era began—one that is now coming to an end.

Now, we are experiencing the seventh reset. The entire capitalist system is being dismantled, and a new form of "inclusive capitalism" is emerging. In reality, this is a form of socialism, and it is becoming increasingly totalitarian. It is essentially moving toward a dictatorship. This reset is no longer confined to the United States; it is a global phenomenon. The United States, having become so influential and powerful, is now driving a worldwide transformation, but in a way that is fundamentally different from previous resets.

Every country is undergoing this transformation in its own way, but the system and the plan are already global. The "new left" is no longer represented by the masses or the proletariat. Instead, it is composed of groups such as homosexuals, new age followers, and various other identities, including transgender individuals and those who identify with non-traditional genders. Today, there are even options to choose from seven or sometimes over thirty different gender identities. This is the kind of world they are building, and this process is set to encompass the entire globe.

Let us keep this development in mind and remain mindful of what is happening and what is yet to come. We must stay strong and not be influenced by these deceptions or trends. We must not be deceived. Instead, we should respond with healthy resistance to the evil that is spreading. We do not want to be corrupted by this widespread moral decay.

Through the stages I have described, we can see how the true nature of this anti-Christian path—corrupting and deceiving the world—is gaining strength and coming into power. The kingdom of the prince of this world is being built, but we are the ones who will dismantle it. With the Lord's help, we are building His kingdom. May His kingdom come, and His will be done on earth as it is in heaven. This is our agenda. This is our plan. We are not afraid of anything that will happen in this fallen world.

May God bless each of you, giving you strength and wisdom.
