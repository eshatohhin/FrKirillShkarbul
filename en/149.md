# How “narratives” influence us, and do we have our own

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is the reason. Today I'm using a new microphone, so hopefully the sound is better.  
Today I want to talk about narrative. The world we live in today is all about narrative.  
In the past, it was ideology—communist, capitalist, Marxist, whatever—but now those days are gone.  
The new term for what has replaced ideology is narrative.  
This is important because there are different narratives that we often don’t notice, yet they shape the way we think.  
They influence our worldview, our direction, and even trends, whether in music, sports, or other areas.  
People listen to certain speakers and, in doing so, absorb the narrative and worldview that speaker promotes.  
If you have speakers you like and listen to often, you know what I’m talking about.  
Their worldview becomes part of your life, your world. You begin to see the world through their eyes. This happens very often.  
We need to see the world through the eyes of Jesus Christ and align ourselves with His narrative.  
Some people say, 'Well, the church teaches dogma, fixed rules. You need to do this, believe that.'  
They argue it’s no longer relevant. Maybe for some people in the Middle Ages, it was important, but we are modern people now.  
They claim it’s not in line with science or the changing world. We live in a digital age, moving into post-modernism and beyond.  
They say it’s outdated, something only traditionalists cling to.  
They criticize those who hold to traditional values, labeling them as backward or out of touch.  
But today’s topic is not about them. The topic is that Jesus Christ will never be outdated.  
His words are timeless, spoken to everyone, everywhere, in any society. He will never become irrelevant.  
Society can drift away from Christ—and indeed, it already has—but that doesn’t mean we cannot find Him or hear His voice.  
Despite speaking different languages and living in different cultures, His message reaches every person, in every nation, at any age.  
We must not mistake His message for the official positions or agendas of the church.  
Often, church leaders themselves adopt narratives from the news, politics, or other sources.  
This is what we see today, and it’s called worldliness.  
When leaders embrace certain agendas, they may prioritize their own interests, becoming entangled in the narratives of the world.  
We need to learn how to become completely free from any worldly narrative and align ourselves only with the narrative of Jesus Christ.  
But how do we find His narrative, especially when even church leaders struggle to do so?  
First, let’s consider what a narrative is.  
A narrative is different from ideology because it’s not fixed.  
Ideology is rigid: 'We must build communism. Period.'  
Narrative, on the other hand, is flexible and adjusts to reality.  
It still carries a worldview and values, but it adapts to what’s happening. It’s dynamic.  
Of course, narrative is not a new concept. Throughout history, wars have been fought over narratives.  
Why did the British go to war against the Spanish, for example?  
The average soldier or citizen didn’t understand the geopolitical reasons.  
Instead, they were driven by a narrative that painted the Spanish as the enemy.

"They're Catholic, they're torturing people, they're so cruel, they're so ugly."  
A certain image was created, and that’s also a narrative.  
In ancient times, we had narrators like Nero, the emperor, who was the first to be called the Antichrist.  
He was the first emperor to bear that title.  
Even today, we say that the spirit of Nero is still alive—the spirit of the Antichrist—because he was cruel, power-hungry, perverse, yet also very cunning.  
He accused Christians when he set Rome on fire, blaming them for the disaster.  
He created a narrative: "All the problems are because of them. They have secret meetings, they’re different from you," and it was easy for people to believe.  
There was some truth to it—Christians did have their own faith and refused to worship idols—but Nero twisted this to fuel his narrative.  
As a result, everyone believed him, and Christians were persecuted.  

Similarly, the Bolsheviks had their narrative: "These classes exploit you, including the priests who cheat you. They’re fat, they’re rich, and you’re poor. Let’s kill them all."  
It worked. These narratives, when created by someone other than Jesus Christ, manipulate people and lead them to destruction.  

Even psychologically, modern narratives are far more influential because of the technology and gadgets we have today.  
People are immersed in virtual reality, spending hours on their devices. They think they’re autonomous and free, but they’re not. We’re not.  
We need to limit how much we’re influenced by what we hear or see through these mediums. We can’t spend 24 hours a day in that space.  

Psychologically, many people are on the verge of losing control—easily irritated, stressed, depressed, or becoming sociopathic, avoiding interaction with others.  
These phenomena are happening because of the powerful narratives being pushed. They aim to scare us about the future—sickness, crises, and other threats.  
We need a strong immune system, a spiritual vaccination, to protect ourselves from these influences.  

Let’s think more deeply. People today don’t like to think. They take information from the news, adopt a worldview, and find it easy to live that way.  
They avoid responsibility, assuming that half the population agrees with them because everyone reads the same things.  
This can lead us to an Orwellian reality, like in *1984*. We don’t want to go there, especially as Christians, because it would mean losing our path to salvation.  

For us, there is only one Shepherd, and we must hear His voice and follow Him. We can’t wander like zombies into other realities, thinking we’re free when we’re being manipulated.  
Proud people never think they’re proud; in the same way, we often think we’re free and independent, but we’re being used.  

Even in the news, we see a shift. In the past, newspapers reported actual events—real news.  
Now, news feels more like a massage—opinions, minor developments, fragmented information. It’s like feeding children; it doesn’t provide anything solid.

It’s giving you something malleable, something they can shape. They call themselves "shapers," molding the world as they see fit. Through influencers—yes, they call them influencers—they spread their narratives.  
There are speakers on YouTube, for example. You might think they’re independent, but no, their platforms are often funded by someone. They use facts, but those facts are carefully selected to manipulate your opinion.  
We must be mindful of this and recognize it immediately. When we see it, we can discern: "This is a fact, but this is manipulation."  

The real question is: What is the Lord’s narrative? If someone doesn’t understand their own narrative, they will lose. They’ll be overtaken by another narrative.  
For example, when a country no longer believes in socialism, it’s over. The narrative has shifted.  
Similarly, if we don’t want the Church—the Church of Christ, not just institutions—to lose its influence in the world, we must understand its narrative.  
The message of Jesus must remain powerful, influencing minds across generations.  

Every one of us has a personal narrative—our life story—that we must build according to the Lord’s will.  
But there’s also a bigger narrative. For us, it’s not about countries or global issues. The bigger narrative is the narrative of the Church of Christ.  
He saves the world through the Church. He is present in the Church, and through the Church, we gain salvation and true life.  
This is why threats to the Church—heresies, ecumenism, schisms, nationalism, worldliness—are the most critical issues for us.  
Everything else—wars, sickness, global events—is secondary, part of a larger picture that pales in comparison to the Church’s mission.  

So, where do we draw this narrative from? How do we understand it? This is a profound question, and we can’t cover everything today.  
But let’s start with the Gospel. It’s the source of our worldview, values, morals, and how we treat others.  
It shapes our attitude toward life: "Blessed are the pure in spirit."  
When we see political agendas, we can ask: Are they rooted in pride, selfishness, or something else?  
With a spiritual understanding of the Gospel, we can evaluate everything through its lens.  

To do this, we must immerse ourselves in the Gospel. Reading it daily isn’t enough; we must live it.  
This requires effort—prayer, spiritual life, fasting. Only then can we gain clarity of mind and make sound spiritual judgments.  
Living in unity with the Church, participating in the Eucharist, helps us align our personal narratives with the Church’s mission.  

The Acts of the Apostles is another vital resource. It helps us understand the Church’s broader mission—what the Apostles did, where they went, and how they spread the Gospel.  
Through their epistles, we learn even more about their goals and challenges.  

Let’s reflect on this: the Church’s mission, its life, and its direction. The Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles guide us, helping us see the bigger narrative and our place within it.

Even the slight differences in traditions and approaches to spiritual life and missions among the Apostles—Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint James, Saint John the Theologian, and others—offer us profound spiritual wisdom.  
Through their lives and teachings, we can better understand the narrative of Christ, how He leads the Church and the world toward the end of days.  
As we grow in this understanding, we’ll be less influenced by the countless other narratives out there, the spiritual noise that tries to pull us in various directions—whether it’s being pro-Trump, pro-something else, pacifist, ecologist, or whatever label they impose.  

For us, the goal is freedom—freedom to remain in constant communication with Jesus Christ Himself.  
May the Lord grant us wisdom, unity, and a clear vision of His will. May He guide us and the entire Church, leading the world toward the goals He has set.  
May the Lord bless us with His joy.  

Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!
