# How to gain “the peace of Christ”

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about the peace of Christ, for without this peace, we cannot be considered true Christians. The Lord said, "I will give you my peace," and the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Peace. This peace is different from the absence of war. When there is earthly peace—no war—it is indeed very good, but this is not the peace that the Lord brings. The Lord brings the peace of heaven, peace from above, and this heavenly peace must enter our hearts and protect us from all kinds of mistakes and temptations.

It is by having this peace in our hearts that we avoid falling into traps. We pray to the Lord, "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." Not being led into temptation is possible when we possess this peace. However, this peace is sometimes mistaken for practices like yoga, which encourage you to calm down, empty your mind, and feel as though you are nothing, absorbed by the universe. This is very different from the peace of Christ. The peace of Christ is not merely rest—it is not about watching TV, movies, or simply taking a break. No, the peace that the Lord brings is profoundly different.

The peace given by Christ allows us to talk to God and listen to Him. We calm our emotions and halt the constant rush of thoughts in our minds. We no longer feel the need to rush or worry about meetings, agendas, or daily tasks. We set these things aside, and in doing so, we create space to listen to what the Lord has to tell us. This can happen through nature—whether in a park, a forest, or even in a quiet room. In any environment, we can experience the Lord's presence and receive His peace.

This peace is of utmost importance, especially in today's world, where everyone is rushing somewhere. With the pandemic, quarantine, and self-isolation, we see how people have become nervous and how many social issues have arisen as a result. This happens because people are not accustomed to simply being still. They are used to running—whether to work, to entertainment, or to other activities. Everyone has a packed agenda, rushing from morning until night. In this constant running and striving to get as much as possible out of life, people are misled and led astray.

It is easy for Satan to lead someone down the wrong path when they are always busy. We can recall our mistakes, whether small or large, and often they occurred because we lacked consideration. We were preoccupied with many things and unable to dedicate our attention to a particular issue, leading to errors. This is a result of the modern mindset that keeps us constantly on the move. People read less because they want information quickly. They skim through Facebook or news headlines, unwilling to sit and read something in depth because it feels boring.

Why do many things seem boring? Because people crave novelty and constant change. Even modern movies reflect this—scenes change rapidly, and everything happens at a fast pace. If we watch a movie from 50 or more years ago, it may seem slow and boring to us. Why? Because we have become accustomed to rushing. And the direction in which we are running is often the wrong one.

This is what the Church calls delusion. Individuals, societies, or even the entire world can be misled and run in the wrong direction. Let us seek the true peace of Christ, which allows us to pause, listen, and follow the path that leads to Him.

And this situation has become much worse after the destruction of all traditional values and moral norms. Even the legal system has been largely dismantled. Constitutions and the principles that were once firmly established have now become flexible—or entirely destroyed—in most countries. The current pandemic represents another stage in the destruction of the old world, eroding everything that was once stable to make it more chaotic and to introduce new principles. These new principles, however, will not be Christian principles. 

We are witnessing yet another step toward a worsening state of affairs. Perhaps we are even standing on the edge of a precipice. In such times, we must learn to stand firm. While everyone else is rushing and running, we need to learn how to remain still. How do we do this? I offer two practical pieces of advice.

First, of course, we must cultivate a spiritual life. I have spoken about this many times, but especially in the context of calming down and becoming still, of quieting our hearts. There are two things we can do. 

The first is to set aside time each day to pause—not necessarily to sit, but to stop the constant flow of activity. This can be done after prayer, perhaps in the morning, though it may be easier in the evening. After evening prayers, we can sit quietly and reflect on our lives, listening to what the Lord wants to tell us. We can examine our relationships with others and our own conscience. We need to step back and calm down. 

An important point to note is that if, during this time of stillness, we feel uncomfortable—if we experience anxiety, stress, or a sense of unease—this is a sign. This discomfort is, in essence, a glimpse of hell. It reveals the true state of our soul and mind. If we are far from God, burdened by serious sins, or facing significant spiritual problems, this stillness will feel like fire. If you find yourself in this situation, it is crucial to address it immediately. Through prayer, attending church, spiritual reading, and resolving conflicts, you must work to heal your soul. Do this before it is too late. Over time, you will see the profound benefits of this spiritual exercise.

The second practical step is to consider taking a spiritual retreat once or twice a year. This could be at a monastery or simply in a natural setting free from daily distractions. This is not merely a time for rest and relaxation but a dedicated period for prayer, reading the Gospel, and engaging in other spiritual readings. It is an opportunity to repair our relationship with God, to reflect on our lives, and to assess whether we are heading in the right direction. This spiritual retreat serves as a reset, allowing us to deepen our faith and realign our priorities.

Let us reflect on these practices. As Christians, we must strive to be deep thinkers and spiritual individuals, carrying the Spirit of Christ within us. We cannot afford to be superficial, constantly chasing the latest news or trends. The Church encourages us to visit cemeteries, for they remind us that eternity is far more important than the fleeting turmoil of this world. By keeping this perspective, we can more easily avoid both major and minor mistakes.

May the Lord help us, grant us His peace, and bless us. Amen.
