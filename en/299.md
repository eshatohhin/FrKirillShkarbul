# Leprosy of the World： We either exit or DIE!

Dear brothers and sisters, during Great Lent, we focus on separating ourselves from this world. We reflect on the words of the Lord, who said that you are in this world but do not belong to it. He also said that His kingdom is not of this world.

This separation, this spiritual distancing from the world—what does it mean? How do we experience it? How do we ensure that we are not part of this world, which is steeped in deception, illusion, and headed down a path of destruction? It is driven by the spirit of Cain and the spirit of Babylon, as I have discussed in other videos. How do we ensure that we are not part of it? To separate and distance ourselves, we must remain vigilant—vigilant over our own souls and vigilant against relying too heavily on others. Often, Christians, particularly Orthodox Christians, may think, "The Church is fine; it is on the right path. We have bishops, monks, and clergy who will guide us in the right direction. I just need to do my part, be part of the Church, participate in services, and all will be well."

This mindset, however, can lead to spiritual complacency and blindness. To remain vigilant, we must engage in spiritual warfare on a personal level. We must feel this struggle daily. If we do not sense this battle—this conflict with the "Pharaoh," the enemy within ourselves, or the struggle against our passions—then we have likely already lost. We are no longer part of the struggle; we have become slaves to deception and delusion.

Today, I want to share some thoughts on how to distance ourselves, how to separate from this world that is rushing toward perdition. It is not merely moving in that direction—it is racing there. The mystery of lawlessness has grown, and people are now craving the Antichrist. This may sound alarmist or even paranoid to some, but the world, including so-called Christians and even some Orthodox Christians, is yearning for the Antichrist. Can you believe it?

We must not accuse anyone or claim superiority. In fact, we must recognize that we are worse than any Cainite or Babylonian. Only through humility can we begin to see the true state of our souls and the world at large. And what we will discover is a dire condition.

First, we must understand that the prince of this world uses deception to mislead people. He makes evil and darkness appear attractive, packaging them in appealing ways. He is quite successful in this. For example, consider boutique stores, luxury cars, endless products, and supermarkets filled with goods. It all seems pleasant—apartments, brands, shopping carts brimming with items. Yet, behind this facade lies immense pain and suffering.

Both the pain of producing all this junk—tons of it manufactured in factories using child labor, 16-hour workdays, and other exploitative practices, including working on Sundays—is quite severe. We also see that for people to shop so much, they need to acquire money, often through deceitful or unethical means. Sometimes, they even resort to stealing. 

This behavior is filled with corruption and dishonesty. When people are driven by their shopping desires, it often leads to family struggles. They may cheat on one another, leading to constant quarrels between husbands and wives, children and parents. Trust erodes. Social studies reveal that people today trust far fewer individuals compared to years ago. They distrust strangers, peers, cultural groups, and even relatives—those they live with and share their lives with. Trust is lost, replaced by a mindset of "every man for himself," where everyone outside is seen as an enemy. 

This is the spirit of Cain taken to its extreme—a profound atomization of society. Behind the facade of nice restaurants with extensive menus offering Chinese, European, Mexican, and other cuisines lies a darker reality. Visit a hospital, and you’ll see countless people suffering from health issues caused by overeating and unhealthy diets. Diabetes, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and other ailments are often the result of gluttony and poor eating habits. Farmers, in turn, produce cheap, unhealthy crops to meet the demand for excessive consumption.

You see those nice parties—people laughing, dancing, and having fun, surrounded by music and entertainment. But behind that joyful facade lies a grim reality. Consider the number of abortions performed, the tiny lives discarded in hospital buckets filled with blood. Think of the overdose deaths—80,000 to 100,000 annually in the United States alone—not counting those lost in car crashes, suicides, or other drug-related tragedies. It’s like a war, a massive, ongoing war, all for the sake of fleeting pleasure. How many people struggle with alcoholism? The list of suffering and destruction goes on endlessly. 

You see the sleek offices and impressive corporate buildings, businesses thriving on the surface. But behind the scenes, there is deceit, betrayal, and even murder—all for money, all in the name of business. "Nothing personal, just business," they say. The ugliness hidden beneath the surface is staggering. It’s not difficult to pierce through the glossy image the world presents. Of course, not every consequence of evil is immediately visible in this life. Like the rich man who celebrated lavishly every day, he felt no repercussions—until he died and found himself in torment in hell. Retribution may not always come in this world, but it will surely come in the next. 

It’s not hard to expose the deceptive "promos" and enticing offers of the prince of this world. The greater challenge lies in confronting what happens within the Church—the true Church of Christ, not the heretical groups steeped in apostasy and deceit. Even within the true Church, there is hypocrisy and strife. Beautiful processions with rows of priests may look glorious, but behind the scenes, there is often tension and conflict among clergy and bishops—over money, power, or personal grievances. If you knew what truly goes on, it would frighten you. This doesn’t mean the Church is fake; it means the spirit of this world is trying to infiltrate even the Church. If we are not vigilant, we will be lost. 

We cannot rely solely on priests or bishops to fight this battle for us. The struggle against evil must take place in our own hearts. Each of us who has chosen to follow Christ is on the front lines of this spiritual war. This is not about accusing others—I am far worse than any priest or clergy member. We must humble ourselves to find the true foundation: union with the living God, belonging to the kingdom of heaven. Our trust must not be in this world, not even in the institutions of the Church, but in the Lord alone. Only then can we truly understand what it means to be part of the body of Christ, to be within the earthly Church—the true catholic and apostolic Orthodox Church. 

Simply being a formal member of the Church guarantees nothing. We see the consequences of failing to separate from the world: church members and bishops becoming entangled in politics, some supporting patriotism, others democracy, liberalism, or other worldly ideologies. This lack of discernment and spiritual vigilance is a grave danger. We must remain steadfast, guarding our hearts and placing our trust solely in Christ, not in the fleeting promises of this world.

To sum up, this world, having chosen to follow the prince of this world—Satan—is on a path of self-destruction. Whether in authoritarian regimes, developing nations plagued by exploitation, dictatorship, poverty, and lack of medicine, or in so-called developed countries consumed by consumerism, egoism, and materialism, the outcome is the same: self-destruction. In wealthier nations, the manifestations may differ—more focus on hedonism, ecumenism, and the merging of religions—but the result is equally devastating. The world’s very mode of existence is self-destruction. To become part of this world is to destroy yourself, your family, your soul, and your future. 

During Great Lent, we are called to make a clear choice: Will we choose mammon, selfishness, ambition, and comfort, or will we choose Christ, self-sacrifice, and the kingdom of heaven? When this choice becomes clear, you will feel the struggle within yourself—the pull of your old self toward evil. This struggle will be present almost every day, but it is through this battle that we awaken and walk the narrow, thorny path to salvation. Though difficult, this path brings great joy, consolation, and peace with the Lord. 

Brothers and sisters, let us use these holy days of Great Lent to cast aside all illusions and deceptions of the devil. Let us walk firmly on the path of salvation. May the wisdom of the Lord, His grace, His peace, His self-sacrifice, and His full commitment to the will of God the Father be with each of you. God bless.
