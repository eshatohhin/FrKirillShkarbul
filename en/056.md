# The biggest deception of our time

Dear friends, today I want to talk about the biggest deception of our time.  
Our time, we can say, is relatively peaceful. We don't have many wars or persecutions of the church.  
We have access to good education, the economy is slowly growing, and it may seem that things are going well.  
Overall, it appears as though the devil is not here, and everything is fine, more or less.  
However, despite this peace, development, economic and technological progress, and the availability of everything—opportunities to make money, freedom from harassment, and so on—this is not like the dark ages or the ancient times of persecution that the church endured.  

Yet, the time we live in can be said to be the most tricky and deceitful of all times.  
This is not an exaggeration. This deception is evident both in the world and within ourselves.  
Today, I want to uncover and expose this deception—what it truly is.  
Christ Himself said that we need to be wise—as simple as doves but as wise as serpents.  
This is not a contradiction, as it may seem. With the wisdom of Christ, we understand how these qualities coexist.  
We are to be positive, honest, and even somewhat naive with others, not assuming they are evil. We see everyone as better than ourselves.  
At the same time, we must remain cautious, aware that evil exists and that deception is out there. We must expose and avoid this deception.  

"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one." The evil one is clever and tricky.  
Christ wants us to be even more clever, to avoid all such deceptions.  
Today, we will try to understand what this deception is, and we can begin with ourselves.  

First, we see this deception within ourselves. It is our hypocrisy.  
We may feel that we believe in God, but if we are honest, we often realize that God is not truly present in our lives.  
Many Christians can admit this: "I don't feel God in my life."  
Why is this so? Because our faith is often fake—merely a decoration.  
It looks like faith, but it is not. We light candles, keep icons in our homes, and wear crosses, but the Lord does not care about these things.  

Consider the story of the two blind men who came to Jesus, asking Him to restore their sight.  
The Bible says He saw their faith. He saw that they acted on what they believed—they believed He could save them.  
He did not look at whether they wore a cross or had any outward symbols. He cared about their actions and whether those actions were motivated by genuine faith.  
This is the true faith the Lord asks of us: that our actions are driven by our faith.  

Yet, often, we are not like this. We live like everyone else, simply going through the motions.  
We think, "Now I belong to this religion; I have faith." But to Christ, this is irrelevant.  
He is not interested in our labels or outward affiliations. He is interested in a living, heartfelt faith that transforms our lives and makes them different from a life without faith.  

This is the deception we must confront, and it is always best to begin with ourselves.  
But what do we see in the world? In the time of Christ, He criticized the Pharisees and the Jews...

He said, "Your fathers killed the prophets, and you are building monuments and tombs to commemorate them." You say, "Oh, they were so great and virtuous," and so on. It is possible to speak highly of Christianity, faith, and traditional values, but this can often be superficial—fake, not real. This is what we see in today's society, including most governments, media, and the entertainment industry. The movies we watch, for example, often portray traditional values, with costumes of knights from ancient times or noble figures from the 17th or 18th century, yet they promote lifestyles and morals that are entirely contrary to Christian teachings.  

We might say, "Look, we are promoting traditional values," but in reality, these depictions are merely for entertainment. We admire the clothes, the settings, and the aesthetics, but we do not live like them. There is a separation: our lives are one thing, and what we watch is a superficial image of a bygone era. Meanwhile, the morals promoted in such movies—adultery, greed, and other vices—are deeply anti-Christian.  

Similarly, governments may claim, "Christianity is good, it is nice, and we allow you to build churches." Yet, the laws and economic policies often make it difficult to sustain churches. In Europe, the United States, and Canada, many churches are being sold, turned into condominiums, or demolished. Through economic pressures and legislation, Christianity is being squeezed out of society. We are moving toward a post-Christian world.  

This is the deception. As the Lord said, "By their deeds you will know them, not by their words." We must uncover and expose this deception in the modern world. It is present in both Western and Eastern societies, where the primary value promoted is mammon—material wealth and self-interest. The message is clear: do not care about righteousness or eternal values; care only about what is convenient, what benefits you materially or advances your career. Everything else is deemed irrelevant.  

This is the work of mammon, and ultimately, it is the goal of Satan to make people think they are Christians while living as pagans, serving not God but mammon. In time, mammon itself will be called God, and this will be represented by the Antichrist.  

This is the great deception of our time. We must be vigilant, seeing clearly what is happening around us and not allowing ourselves to be swept up in the crowd rushing toward spiritual destruction and the death of the soul. Let us remain sober and alert, always ready to overcome these deceptions. Let us continually strive to overcome our old selves, making daily decisions rooted in our faith.  

The Lord saw the faith of the blind men in their actions. He must see our faith in the choices we make every day—choices motivated by our belief in Him and our commitment to His divine commandments. This is what truly matters.  

Let us be His true disciples, genuine Christians, strengthening our faith daily with His help and grace. May the Lord bless all of you.
