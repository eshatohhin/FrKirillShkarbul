# Why gifts of the Holy Spirit became few

Dear friends, a very important question that we need to discuss is why spiritual gifts have become so scarce in our times.  
What do I mean?  
Well, we see that in the early church, many people were prophets. Many were willing to become martyrs. People prayed all night long, every day. They were eager to go to other countries to spread the faith, and they were not afraid of anything. Many sold all their possessions for the sake of God and donated to the poor. For them, the motivation to serve Christ was so great that many received spiritual gifts, enabling them to speak directly to God and receive His messages. Many other gifts were also given to the early Christians.  

However, after 100 years, by the end of the 2nd century, Christians were already writing about a weakening of faith. They noted a scarcity of those gifts compared to what had been present in the past. At that time, they referred to earlier times as a period of flourishing, an example for them to strive toward, to become stronger and more fervent in faith, because it had already begun to wane.  

Now, 2000 years have passed since the time of Christ, and faith has grown even weaker than before—even compared to 100 years ago. Secularization is so pervasive that, for most Christians today, being pious means going to church on Sunday. What does that entail? It means dedicating two hours of your time to prayer. But for the rest of the week, people forget about God, becoming completely immersed in worldly matters, prioritizing other things. This is why people repeatedly commit the same sins. It has become very difficult to gain any spiritual gift.  

This is what is now considered piety. And we ask, how is it that spiritual gifts are so few? In the church, we have fewer and fewer elders—perhaps almost none. Who are elders? Elders are those who can prophesy, discern who you are, understand your background and your problems. They can pray and resolve your issues. They ask God to heal you, and you are healed immediately. There used to be people like this in the church, but they are becoming fewer and fewer—perhaps they no longer exist, though we had some in the recent past.  

In any case, we can see that the willingness to sacrifice oneself is diminishing. Kindness and true love, which once shone in the eyes of Christians, are becoming rarer. This is why many people are turning to sects, Islam, and other religions—even to crazy religions. Many are becoming atheists or embracing hedonism, saying, "No religion, just enjoy your life." Many of these problems arise because of the lack of faith and spiritual gifts among modern-day Christians.  

So why does this happen, and what can we do about it?  
The first principle, the first rule that any Christian—anyone who considers themselves a Christian—should follow is to recognize that the root problem is me. I myself am the core issue in everything, whether it’s social issues, politics, or anything else. First, we must say, "I am the problem. I have not done many things that I could have done, things the Lord hoped I would do, but I did not. I am lazy, I am selfish, I lack true faith, I am not fervent in my faith." We must start with ourselves. We cannot blame others; the problem is us—me and you.  

The second rule follows from the first. The greatest opportunity to change this situation lies with me, with myself. I need to begin changing the world by starting with myself—by doing what I can today, tomorrow, and every day to improve this situation. If we approach the matter in this way, it will truly be improved.

We can bring about many changes with the Lord's help. These two rules—recognizing that the problem lies within ourselves and understanding that the opportunity for change also begins with us—must always be kept in mind, no matter what we are discussing. Today, we are addressing the weakness of faith and the lack of spiritual gifts.  

How do we know this is happening? Many people who consider themselves faithful do not read the Gospel, do not pray, and do not witness about their faith to others. They are unwilling to do so. Why is this the case? The core issue is selfishness. Everyone is obsessed with themselves—their future, their comfort, their life, their problems. This self-centeredness is our primary struggle.  

Another issue is that we prioritize everything above God, the Gospel, and the kingdom of heaven. Our jobs, careers, comfort, possessions, bills, hobbies—these take precedence. Serving God and living according to the Gospel often fall to the background. These are the two main reasons why faith weakens and spiritual gifts diminish.  

Christ said in John 14:21, "Whoever loves me will obey my commandments." Yet, many of us do not even know what the Lord's commandments are. We rarely think about them. Are they the Ten Commandments, or are they the teachings of Christ? The commandments of Christ are His words, which should live within us. We should think about them constantly, read the Gospel daily, and see how they apply to our everyday lives.  

The foremost commandment is self-sacrifice: "Whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" (Matthew 16:25). If we focus only on our own lives and well-being, we will lose our spiritual vitality. We must bear our cross and follow Christ. This demonstrates our love for Him; otherwise, we do not truly love Him.  

Christ also said in John 14:21, "Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him." What does it mean for the Lord to manifest Himself to us? It means we will know Him personally and intimately. It will not merely be an intellectual acknowledgment that Jesus is the Savior, but a deep, personal relationship with Him. As Christ told the apostle Philip, "Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9).  

When we keep Christ's commandments, God the Father loves us in a special way. Does God not love everyone? Yes, but His love for those who love Him is unique and profound. We should desire to be loved by God in this way—to be dear and precious to Him.  

Why are we not experiencing this love? Because we are either doing something wrong or failing to do what we should. On an individual level, we must address this problem. We cannot simply point fingers and say, "You have a problem." The issue lies within each of us.  

What can we do? We must wake up every morning with the thought, "I am not doing enough. What can I do today to serve the Lord and please Him?" This should be our daily question. We must constantly critique ourselves, striving to grow in faith and obedience. Only then can we begin to reverse the weakness of faith and the scarcity of spiritual gifts in our lives.

I am not doing enough, okay? The Apostle Paul tells us that we must run as if in a race, striving to grasp the reward at the end. We will receive the crown of victory, but only if we run with determination. We must always reflect on our spiritual laziness and recognize that we are not doing what we are called to do. Spiritually, we must never give up or relax.  

We need to awaken ourselves spiritually because the Lord said that those who do not follow Him are like the dead—spiritually dead. These are harsh words, but they are true. Let us awaken ourselves and seek God with a constant craving for Him. Let us practice repentance, striving to change ourselves and break away from our old selves. This requires decisiveness—breaking away from all sinful habits and wrong ideas. We must be ready to transform our entire mindset to align with Christ, to follow Him, and to serve Him with all our strength, bearing as much fruit as possible for His glory.  

May the Lord grant us this eagerness, this motivation, and this heart. May He help us on this path to grow spiritually and draw closer to Him day by day. God bless.
