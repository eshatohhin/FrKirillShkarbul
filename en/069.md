# How can a lay person do mission

Dear brothers and sisters, an 18th-century philosopher once said that God has died.  
We can only express our sorrow for this person and the people he was describing, as he was referring to the society of that time. For the majority of people, God indeed seemed to have died. However, this only reveals how far people and society had drifted from God. The Lord is as alive as He has always been and always will be. He is full of power and grants this power to us. He gives us true life and grace.  

Every one of us who has experienced the power, enlightenment, and motivation from our Lord cannot keep it to ourselves. The notion that everything is so bad—that people are materialistic, far from God, and that society is corrupt, with no one attending churches—is a temptation. In many countries, churches have been turned into condominiums or museums, and no one visits them. Some say we live in a post-Christian world, that it’s all over, that it’s all finished.  

But we must not listen to such ideas or feel defeated. Nothing is finished, and nothing is decided. For the Lord, everything is open. Much depends on us, every one of us. As we see in the Apocalypse, in the Book of Revelation, and in the writings of St. Hermas, the construction of the Church is ongoing. The laborers are doing their work. Until it is all finished, the world will continue to exist and will not end. Therefore, each of us must contribute as much as we can to this construction and to building the Church of God.  

Today, I want to speak about the mission work that can be done by any layperson, not just a priest. This is important because there is a temptation to think, "I cannot do much; I am just an ordinary person. I work somewhere, I have many sins, and I am not worthy of speaking about God or faith. It’s just not my thing." This is a grave mistake because all of us are witnesses of Christ. If we are not, we are not truly Christians. We must bear this testimony.  

One of the subscribers asked me how a layperson can engage in ministry. First, we must understand that it is not we who will do the ministry. It is God Himself who will work through us. We simply need to be present and say what we are called to say at the right moment. In essence, we are nothing but tools in God’s hands. Our task is to bring our bodies and souls to the right place. Everything else will be done by God.  

Another crucial point is that before engaging in any public mission or active outreach for the Lord, we must prepare ourselves—our lives and our souls. What do we need? First, we must be stable in our moral, spiritual, and psychological lives. We should not have extreme ups and downs, at least not visibly. We must avoid deep depressions, anger, or harboring negative feelings toward others. These things must be addressed because they can become a negative testimony. If people see us as unstable or troubled, they may say, "I don’t want to be a Christian because this person is a mess."  

If we lack this stability, we should refrain from extensive outreach and focus instead on our closest family. Additionally, we must avoid promoting our own ideas beyond the Gospel and salvation. We should set aside any political views when sharing the message of Christ. These are essential steps in preparing ourselves for the work of ministry.

One more essential requirement for ourselves is regular prayer and regular attendance at church for the liturgy, participation in divine services, and the holy sacraments of confession and the Eucharist. Without these, we cannot be a good example of a Christian to others. We will lack the spiritual strength needed to bear the right testimony and deliver the right message. These practices are our spiritual nourishment, and we must make it a habit to partake in them regularly. Ideally, we should aim for holy confession and communion at least once a month—or even more frequently. If we go more than a few months without receiving communion, it should serve as a red flag, prompting us to repair our relationship with God as soon as possible.  

Another crucial step is to seek a blessing, preferably from a priest. Without this, we risk falling into pride. If we experience success—such as bringing someone to church—we might mistakenly attribute it to ourselves, thinking, "This is my accomplishment. More people will be in heaven because of me." Such thoughts come from the devil and will lead to failure in our mission. By seeking a blessing, we attribute any success to God and the prayers of the priest who blessed us. Additionally, those we bring to faith will likely seek guidance from the same priest.  

It is also important to have a parish or church community where we can invite people. The members of this community should be aware of your missionary efforts so that when someone new arrives, they can warmly welcome them. This sense of belonging and acceptance is vital. Even if only one or two people, besides yourself, are there to greet them, it makes a difference. They will feel expected and welcomed.  

As missionaries, we become soldiers of Christ, and every soldier needs weapons. Our weapons are not limited to our faith; we also need basic training in the faith. We must know the Gospel and other foundational teachings. Additionally, we should have practical tools to aid our mission.  

First, we need a book to recommend to those interested in Orthodoxy or the true faith. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a catechism; it could be a book that personally moved you. You might even have different books for different audiences—children, adults, intellectuals, or women. Over time, they can explore more books, but you should have a starting point ready.  

Second, consider having a movie, video, or YouTube channel to recommend. Perhaps a lecture, chant, or other resource that might touch someone’s heart.  

Third, carry small icons with you—perhaps in your bag—so you can give them as gifts to those who show interest. Icons of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, or other saints can be meaningful tokens.  

Fourth, have brochures or magazines on hand. If your country has an Orthodox magazine, keep a few copies to share. Magazines are easier to distribute than books and can serve as a natural way to introduce people to the faith. Brochures with church addresses, websites, or Facebook pages can also be helpful, providing a brief introduction to the faith and practical information.  

In summary, our mission requires spiritual preparation, practical tools, and a supportive community. By equipping ourselves in these ways, we can effectively share the message of Christ and bring others closer to God.

We don’t distribute materials indiscriminately, as sects often do, but we should have them ready for those who genuinely want to learn more.  

Now, where can we carry out our mission? In today’s world, it’s challenging because people are often isolated, and stopping someone on the street to talk about Christ isn’t natural or effective. However, in Orthodox countries, it’s easier. There are large events like expos, fairs, concerts, or volunteer gatherings that attract both churchgoers and non-churchgoers. These settings provide a natural opportunity to discuss faith and Orthodoxy and to share materials with those who express interest.  

In other countries, we can participate in events with specific themes or topics. For example, cultural celebrations, art expos, or trade shows with a social or cultural focus can provide a platform for meaningful conversations. In such settings, you can discuss the event’s theme and gradually introduce topics of faith if the other person is open to it. If they’re not interested, we respectfully move on. It’s crucial not to be pushy or persuasive. Scare tactics, like threatening hellfire, are ineffective and counterproductive.  

Another important avenue for mission is in our daily lives—our workplaces, homes, and neighborhoods. Everyone around us should know that we are Orthodox Christians. This doesn’t mean being overly assertive or preachy, but it does mean living in such a way that our faith is evident. If we lead good, upright lives, people will notice. When they have questions about faith or God, they’ll know whom to approach. They’ll see us as someone who attends church regularly and is willing to discuss spiritual matters.  

If we hide our faith, it’s a missed opportunity. Of course, if our behavior contradicts our faith, it’s better not to draw attention to it. But as we strive to live as good witnesses, we should ensure that our faith is known.  

Additionally, we should continually deepen our own knowledge of the faith. Participating in Orthodox study groups, Bible classes, or liturgical practices like chanting can enrich our understanding. Being part of a parish that offers such activities is ideal. Surrounding ourselves with other Orthodox Christians who are also engaged in mission work allows us to share experiences and learn from one another.  

While online platforms like social media can be useful for mission work, they should not become our primary focus. Spending too much time on Facebook or similar platforms often leads to idle chatter, endless scrolling, and wasted time. Real-life interactions and events are far more impactful. Social media can supplement our efforts, but it should not replace face-to-face engagement.  

Another meaningful way to engage in mission is by inviting people to pray with us in church. For example, if someone is facing a challenge—like finding a job or dealing with illness—we can invite them to join us for a prayer service. This could be an Akathistos, Moleben, or another type of prayer service, preferably on a day other than Sunday when the church is less crowded. In this setting, they can experience the beauty of communal prayer in a more intimate and less overwhelming environment.  

In summary, mission work requires discernment, preparation, and a focus on genuine relationships. By being present in our communities, living as witnesses of Christ, and inviting others to experience the faith in meaningful ways, we can effectively share the love and truth of God with those around us.

We simply pray with our friend or with someone who is willing to draw closer to the church. We pray together, and we must also be able to explain everything in the church. We need to learn what everything means and be able to share interesting stories as we guide people and explain the significance of the church’s elements. This is a skill we must develop.  

Additionally, we need to be able to offer a living testimony of our faith. For example, if someone is sick, we should immediately say, “Let’s pray here and now.” We pray and ask God for healing, help, and support. If someone in your family is ill, you can say, “Let’s pray right now, right away.” People need to feel that our faith is alive—not just an abstract tradition, a set of ideas, or something confined to books. It is alive here and now. We talk to God, and this is what we must demonstrate.  

We must also remember that every person has a great potential for faith. It’s as if people are asleep, much like peasants in the past who seemed inactive until an idea stirred them to action, sometimes even leading to revolutions or other destructive outcomes. In the same way, we can awaken people to something good—the search for God, His truth, and eternal life. Our task is to awaken this sleeping potential, to help people shift their focus from daily worries to the eternal.  

Faith is not merely an addition to life—it’s not just about adding prayers or learning new ideas. Faith is an entirely different world. We must help people feel the tension between these two worlds: the world of daily concerns, self-interest, and materialism, and the world of faith in Christ. These are two different realms, with different motives for living and thinking, and different internal states. We must invite people to step into this new world, to leave behind their old ways and see that their former concerns are not as important as they once seemed.  

This is our task. We must have a clear understanding of this and always strive to improve, to become more eager and proactive. As I said earlier, nothing is already decided. Much depends on each of us. What we do matters—our testimony about Christ, our faith, and the good we create every day for the Lord.  

May the Lord help you, bless you, and give you the courage and motivation to carry out this mission. God bless.
