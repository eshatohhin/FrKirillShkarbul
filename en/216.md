# What to Do When Dataism is Coming

Dear brothers and sisters, last time I talked about the one-world religion that is coming—it's already here. If you haven't seen the last video, please watch that one first because today I'm going to discuss what we can do about this. A subscriber asked me about it, and I think this is an important question. So, what's next?

Well, in the last video, I mentioned the basis for Dadaism. What is Dadaism? I hope you can do some research yourself if you don't know what that is. But the spiritual and even ideological basis for Dadaism is Mamonism. What is Mamonism? Mamonism is when you live for money, wealth, comfort, yourself, your passions, career, health, tasty food, enjoyment—anything that has nothing to do with the Lord. When something becomes more important than the Lord, even if it's a good thing, like health, but if it becomes more important to you, that becomes your idol. And you selfishly follow and worship that idol. That's Mamonism. And that is apostasy.

I talked about it in one of my earlier videos, *Godlessness*. You can find it because I think it's important. It can take the form of capitalism, socialism, or even New Age spirituality. It can take all kinds of shapes and forms, but essentially, it's Mamonism. It can even appear contradictory, like modernism and postmodernism, or humanism and post-humanism. They seem to contradict each other, or totalitarianism and democracy. They might contradict each other, but that doesn't mean they are not Mamonism. They use the Marxist idea that progress comes from two opposites fighting each other, and then you have progress. Marxism comes from the Talmud, but that's another discussion.

So, the first thing we need, if we don't want to become followers of this new religion, is to overcome Mamonism in ourselves, first and foremost. Because all of us are polluted and enslaved to some degree by this Mamonism. You don't have to look far—it's in you. It's in every one of us because of our old self, our flesh, and our exposure to all this stuff from early childhood. Our sins, our passions—this is why we need asceticism.

To be more precise, I can say that as Dataism became the next stage after the era of Humanism—500 years after the Reformation, we had this era of Humanism—we first need to overcome this Humanism in ourselves. What is Humanism? Humanism is placing human things above the Divine. Finding authority in myself instead of in the Divine. I'm not talking about the Pope, the Inquisition, or all that kind of stuff from the Middle Ages. But the trust was not in the Divine; the trust was in the human. Even in the Reformation, it became the individual human who interprets the Bible in their own way. That is the measure of truth for them, and that's the only truth there is. So even in religion, this became the cornerstone aspect.

Once we can throw away all these wrong ideas and concepts, we will trust the Lord. We will trust the holy tradition of the Church, and we will find answers in prayer and in the holy teaching of the Church, including the Holy Scripture. This brings us to the main tool, the main weapon, the main strategy we need to withstand this deception. It is spiritual. We need to understand that even though it seems technological—we're talking about digital stuff, technologies, AI, genetics, digital currency, and all that kind of stuff—we need to understand that behind this, if it comes as a new religion, there is a spirit. And this spirit wants to have total control of the human race. This means that this spirit is playing God. And this means that it is against God. And who is against God? Satan. So now we see that there is a spiritual force behind all of this, which is Satan himself.

So, if you want to find Satan, don’t expect to do so by simply buying gold and silver, throwing away your cell phone, or making it safe from spyware. Any physical strategy alone is not going to save you in the end. It might help to some extent, but if you don’t have the spiritual weapons, if you don’t have the foundation for this struggle, you will eventually lose. Satan will find a way to trick you, cheat you, scare you, and make you surrender. So, don’t expect that these things alone will save you. 

I’m not saying you don’t need those things or strategies—you do, and I’ll talk about that later. But the main goal for every one of us is a spiritual goal. What do I mean by that? We need to find our anchor in Christ. We need to love prayer. We need to embrace asceticism, self-control, and temperance—not being addicted, not having habits, and not being dependent on digital or material things to the extent possible. Of course, we cannot completely avoid this, but we can try. 

Think about it: in the past, leaving your cell phone at home wasn’t a big deal. But now, if you leave your cell phone, you feel anxious. You worry, “Maybe something happened. Maybe someone messaged me something important. I’m missing out.” That means you’re already dependent. You’re hooked. We need to recognize this and strive to make ourselves independent of these things. 

If I were to fast from digital distractions, I would completely cut out anything that wastes time or pollutes my mind. Because it’s not just a waste of time—it’s hacking our brains. These days, people have hacked brains, and they go to war because they can’t tell the difference between killing in a game and killing in real life. Their hearts and minds are already hacked. 

You might say, “We’re just playing Tetris.” But Tetris, or any game, draws your attention into it. By focusing on useless things, you live without God. You become alienated from Him. You can’t think about Him. You can’t pray. You’re being pulled away from God. I hope you understand what I mean. For example, you can spend hours on some activity like that and not even notice it. Why? Because you’re switched off from a life with God. And that has a tremendous effect on your soul. 

So, first and foremost, we need spiritual strength and a connection with the Lord. We need to know what that means. We need the anchor of salvation. Personally, I often go to a monastery where they pray constantly and live in obedience to the Lord. It’s a great spiritual experience. They don’t have internet, electricity, or cell phones—nothing. This is very helpful for me. You can find a church, a community, or a monastery where you can go from time to time to recharge. Talk about spirituality with others because it’s really difficult to withstand these challenges on your own. 

We’re too weak, and our faith is often too weak. So, we learn, we try, and we pray. However, you might need spiritual guidance or at least a group of people who also love Christ, with whom you can pray, talk, and share your faith. Seeing their faith and experiencing it will be very important for you. And it also means you have a place to escape to if things get bad and you feel like you can’t withstand the pressure. 

Hopefully, we can bear witness. If things go badly, the best thing we can do is not to run away to the mountains, deserts, or forests. The best thing, if you’re able, is to stand and testify to the truth in the midst of the Kingdom of the Antichrist, so to speak. But if that becomes impossible, then you need a place to escape—a place where you feel spiritually safe. Ultimately, you need to learn to be spiritually safe anywhere.

With Christ, you can be anywhere and still be spiritually safe, even in the midst of war. But it’s not easy—that’s our goal. 

As for other matters, I won’t say too much because my primary goal is to preach the Lord and focus on spirituality. However, regarding the technological era we’re in—this technocratic or Dataist age—you can and should learn a lot from experts. There are many people discussing these topics. Try not to focus only on the positive narratives. Right now, they’re filtering and censoring anything with negative connotations, especially when it comes to AI and related technologies. Seek out different perspectives and read widely. 

One key area is the rise of digital control. Many people are talking about it and offering practical advice on how to avoid becoming too vulnerable to this control, which is only going to intensify. Concepts like smart cities, virtual environments, digital IDs, e-currencies, and more are becoming realities. You need to understand what these are and how they affect you. How can you avoid the slavery that comes with these systems if you don’t even know what they are? Educate yourself. This isn’t my main focus here, but it’s crucial. 

Another important area is the psychological and social changes happening in this new era. How are they hacking the human brain, the human soul? How is our communication, memory, and self-awareness being altered or destroyed? These changes affect how we interact with one another on a social level, as well as the philosophical and economic systems we live under. For example, the push for universal basic income—how will that work? We need to understand these shifts. 

This is about self-education and possibly even taking courses to understand these technologies and their implications. The attack we’re facing is coming from all directions. They want to create a new world, and you need to be prepared. But as I’ve said, the most important foundation is spiritual. Without it, you can’t truly withstand any of this. 

I think the basic goal for every human right now is simply to survive—not to die. With the wars they’re pushing people into, the pseudo-culture promoting drugs and unhealthy lifestyles, and the many other dangers, survival is key. You’ve likely heard about vaccinations and other controversial topics. The goal is not to die unnecessarily. If you die for nothing, you’re out of the equation. This basic goal of survival is important because, as we know, the devil seeks not only to kill people but also to destroy their souls. Spiritually, we all need more time for repentance, for serving the Lord, and for drawing closer to Him. We need that time, so we don’t want to die too soon—unless we are called to be martyrs. 

Don’t believe propaganda blindly. As I’ve said, those who talk about “fake news” are often the ones spreading it. Be discerning. I’m not saying you should believe in reptilians, aliens, or other so-called “crazy conspiracies,” but there is such a thing as healthy skepticism. We know there is a devilish conspiracy against humanity. The Apostle Paul spoke of the “mystery of lawlessness” at work in the world. Many of the devil’s plans are hidden, though they are becoming more visible now. 

Healthy skepticism means comparing, studying, and reading widely. Be open to alternative ideas, especially if they are well-grounded and backed by evidence or analysis. Don’t blindly trust the mainstream narrative. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and above all, stay rooted in Christ. That is the only way to navigate these times.

If you are in the mainstream, you will be like the herd of swine that rushed into the sea and perished. We don’t want to be like that. For myself, I’ve decided I won’t ever use CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). I don’t want it. I can afford to avoid it, and I choose not to use e-currency. Some of you may not be able to avoid it entirely, especially if you’re in business. You may have to sell things, and people might pay you with e-cards or digital money. But as much as possible, I’ve decided to avoid it. I won’t use it to the extent I can. 

And of course, all these biopassports and other “fancy” digital tools—they claim it’s for safety, convenience, or whatever. No, it’s for slavery. That’s the reality. These things are important to consider. Beyond that, the Lord Himself will guide you in your specific life situation about what you should do to avoid these traps. 

But the first and foremost priority is our ministry to Christ. It’s not just about saving ourselves from all these dangers but about how we can serve the Lord in the midst of this chaos. Don’t just focus on how to avoid the dangers. Instead, think about how you can serve the Lord in these times. Maybe you’re called to do a mission, engage in ministry, or sacrifice your time for something meaningful. Don’t live in fear of what’s coming. Think more about how you can glorify God in the midst of it all. 

To receive the Lord’s guidance in this, you need to love prayer and cultivate a strong spiritual life. These are the things I wanted to share with you. May the Lord give you strength, strengthen your faith, grant you wisdom, and guide you. May He protect you, your family, and your friends from all the deception that is coming. Amen. God bless.
