# Wealth, business and Faith - what is Christian attitude to money and prosperity

Dear friends, today's topic is very important, both practically and spiritually. How do we treat money, wealth, and everything related to it? We remember that Christ Himself said that for a rich man, it is very difficult to reach the Kingdom of Heaven. It is almost impossible. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. And how critical this is in our times! Because what we learn from society is that money is the most important thing, and that no one will take care of you unless you take care of yourself. So, you need to work hard, earn a lot of money, achieve financial freedom, and other things. 

But we need to clarify: What does this mean? Why is it difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven? And how do we change our values and our attitude toward wealth? We can learn from the experience of many Christians and saints. But first, we need to understand that the main problem lies in the antagonism between material goods and spiritual matters—the Kingdom of Heaven, the commandments of Christ, and eternal life. There is a tension between the two. Yet, we are material beings. This makes it difficult for us to simply forget about money and earthly concerns and focus solely on God and spiritual matters. 

So, where is the balance? What change does Christ want us to make to truly become Christians and not pagans? Because, in a pagan mindset—and most of us have a pagan mindset—what matters most is what benefits me. Pagans have many idols and gods, and they form relationships with them to gain something beneficial. For pagans, the main god is the god of prosperity, as all resources come from this god. This is mammon. From Old Testament times to the early church, deviations from faith often involved turning toward mammon. 

What is mammon? Mammon represents wealth, riches, money, comfort, and everything related to earthly well-being and prosperity. When these become the main values and goals for a person, they become a servant of mammon, leaving no room for God in their life. This is also a problem for the church. When the church adopts a worldly mindset, it loses the grace of God, its communion with Him, and its mission. The soul becomes "unsalty." 

So, how do we live in this world while serving God? There are two ways. For someone willing to follow Christ, the first way is radical. In the early church, many people sold everything they had and followed Christ and the apostles wherever they went. They lived almost like angels, free from earthly concerns, relying completely on God for their daily needs. 

The second way is more moderate. This path falls short of radical Christianity but is still possible. Many have walked this path. It is acceptable due to the fallen nature of the world. In this way, a person may still possess property and financial resources, but crucially, these do not become their main treasure. For them, the true treasure remains in heaven. They are ready in their hearts to let go of all earthly possessions if called to do so. For them, losing these things would not be a catastrophe or tragedy. This readiness of heart is our task.

While we are living in this world, not all of us are able to make the radical decision to, for example, enter a monastery or live in complete detachment from material concerns. We remain in this world, with bills to pay, responsibilities to fulfill, and relatives who may rely on our income. We must deal with these material things. The crucial point is that, for us, money should become merely numbers and possibilities—tools to achieve certain goals—rather than something to which we attach our hearts. It should not become an object of affection or obsession. 

Another important shift in mindset is recognizing that money does not truly belong to us. The common way of thinking is, "I earned it; it is the fruit of my sacrifice—my time, energy, and talents. Therefore, it is mine." Whether it is wages, a salary, or business profits, we often claim ownership over it. However, this mindset is fundamentally wrong. Instead, we must treat all material resources, including money, as entrusted to us by God. We have a responsibility to use these resources according to God’s will, understanding what He desires us to do with them. This sense of responsibility should be accompanied by a kind of reverent fear—a piety—that ensures we use these resources wisely and properly. A Christian would never waste money or use it recklessly but would instead use it in a responsible and purposeful manner.

Another key aspect of a Christian mindset is viewing our work or business as a ministry, not merely a means of earning money. It should be seen as a form of service to people and to God Himself. We must understand that we have a mission entrusted to us by God, and through our work, we carry out that mission by doing good for others. Moreover, we can and should aim for an even higher mission. For example, if we run a business that produces goods—such as cups or other items—we can dedicate a portion of our production, say 10%, to help those in need, such as the poor, orphans, or widows. This act of mercy will bless the rest of our business. 

Even if we are employees rather than business owners, we can use our workplace as a platform to fulfill a mission for God. This could involve spreading the word of God among coworkers, performing acts of kindness, or offering encouragement. It could be as simple as showing mercy or doing something useful for others. If company rules permit, we might even share the message of Christ. This higher mission, integrated into our daily work, becomes a blessing that elevates our professional endeavors. It is like a "Sunday" that blesses the rest of the week, infusing our work with a deeper purpose and value.

The big issue is that we often view our jobs or businesses as a means to gain something for ourselves—whether it is income, profit, or personal benefit. This mindset must be reversed. Instead, we should see our work as a form of self-sacrifice, a way to serve others and fulfill God’s will. If we receive payment for our work, it should be seen as gratitude from others, not something we demand or expect. It is not an entitlement but a gift. This shift in perspective transforms our relationship with work, money, and material possessions, aligning it with the values of the Kingdom of Heaven.

This mindset transforms money and work into unexpected gifts—blessings from God that we do not deserve but are graciously provided. When we adopt this perspective, we are no longer troubled by grudges or frustrations about why things are the way they are. Instead, we experience peace of mind and the blessings that come from aligning our lives with God’s will. 

Why is work so important, and why do we encourage everyone—especially the faithful—to engage in it? We do not advocate for idleness or aimless living, except in cases of retirement or specific circumstances. It is not normal for someone to neither work nor study but simply to "hang around." Why? Because work nurtures essential virtues that are crucial not only for daily life but also for spiritual growth. 

What virtues does work cultivate? First, **discipline**. Through work, we become more disciplined. We wake up in the morning, follow a routine, and focus on our tasks. This discipline is vital for a healthy soul. A soul that is always relaxed, idle, and wasting time is in the wrong state. We need to be disciplined, sober, and ready to work. A strong will is necessary to make important decisions, to change ourselves, and to grow spiritually. This is how we become soldiers of Christ, which is our ultimate goal. Just as a farmer’s land bears fruit only through hard work and activity, so too must we labor to bring forth spiritual fruit.

Second, work fosters **community and cooperation**. By working with others, we learn to build team spirit and collaborate. This is important for Christians, as we are not meant to live in isolation, doing only what we want. Such atomization is unhealthy. Working with others makes our souls more noble because we serve God through our labor. It also teaches us humility. When a boss or colleague points out our mistakes, we have the opportunity to grow humbly if we accept the lesson. Often, we are blind to our own flaws and operate under the illusion that we are always right. Work helps us develop self-criticism and a commitment to continuous improvement.

Third, work nurtures **responsibility**. In today’s world, people are becoming less and less responsible. Many avoid commitments like marriage or having children because they fear the responsibility. Others make promises but fail to follow through, distracted by more "interesting" pursuits. Work, with its clear tasks and accountability, teaches us to be responsible. It also instills **self-sacrifice**, as we give our time and energy for the good of others. Additionally, work cultivates **obedience**. We learn to listen to others, such as our bosses, and become less self-centered and egoistic.

All these virtues—discipline, humility, responsibility, self-sacrifice, and obedience—are essential for becoming not only a good person but also a good Christian. However, we must always remember that for us, everything is centered on Christ. Our work is not done for personal gain, comfort, or financial freedom. For a Christian, there is no such thing as financial freedom in the worldly sense. Instead, we seek spiritual freedom, relying on God to provide for our needs and to grant us the wisdom to use our resources and talents in the right way. 

In this way, work becomes a ministry to Christ, a way to serve Him and others, rather than a means to enrich ourselves. This shift in perspective allows us to live with purpose, peace, and the assurance that God is guiding and blessing our efforts.

To organize our earthly life, serve Him, and gain eternal life—this is our ultimate purpose. I hope today's message was helpful and practical. You can apply these insights to your daily activities, but it is crucial that we fundamentally change our understanding and perception of material goods, the reason we work, and how we treat the money we have in our pockets. 

May God bless you, grant you wisdom, and help us all transform our mindset and our hearts. God bless.
