# Christian mysticism vs. pagan occultism.

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about mysticism.  
The early church had a very profound sense that the Kingdom of Heaven had arrived and that they were citizens of this Kingdom.  
This new reality gave them a new understanding of the world, of relationships between people, and of their attitude toward property, wealth, and other material values.  
It instilled in them a deep feeling that they were in a foreign world, that this empire, this society, was something external to them—something that continued to live as it always had.  
It faced the same issues and problems as before, but their vision and goals had become entirely different.  
They carried a secret citizenship, a hidden passport of sorts, that granted them new life, new direction, and a power and joy that no one else possessed.  
Because they were so few in number, they used secret symbols to communicate and convey information.  

Today, I have brought with me a very ancient artifact from the 4th century—a bread stamp used for the Prosphora, the bread prepared for Holy Communion, which would become the body and blood of Jesus Christ.  
This stamp bears an inscription in Greek: "Is Theos," meaning "One God, one and only."  
You can also see a symbol here called the Staurogram, formed by the Greek letters Rho (R) and Tau (T).  
These two letters represent Christ. The Staurogram, combining R and T, creates the shape of a cross with a loop at the top, which was one of the earliest forms of the Christian cross.  
This symbol would have been incomprehensible to outsiders, understood only by those within this secret group of revolutionaries.  

At that time, the entire Christian church was a small, secret society. They believed that the truth they lived by was the ultimate reality.  
The external world became like a transparent veil to them. They were still in the world and had a mission within it, but the external world was not absolute or as significant as the true reality of the Kingdom of Heaven, which had already arrived and in which they lived and moved.  
This reality was realized in their hearts.  

Later, when the majority of the population became Christian, this understanding was lost. Christians began to think, "We own this land; we have Christian countries and villages. We are here, and our world is here. We live in Christ, yes, but we are not outsiders or guests in this world."  
However, it is crucial to remember that early Christians knew they were merely guests in this world. Nothing truly belonged to them—not property, nor titles. They belonged to another kingdom, a heavenly one.  
This understanding is vital for us today. We need to restore and recover this true sense of who we are, what we do, and where we are going.  
This is why mysticism, from this perspective, is so important in the Christian life.  

We also know that when we meet someone new, especially as children, we often feel a sense of mystery and sympathy toward them.  
When we love someone, we often anticipate what they might say or do, as though they are a mystery to us.  
But as we grow older and become entangled in sinful life, we grow cynical. We develop preconceived notions about people—how those from a certain country behave, how teachers or policemen act. We think we have answers for everyone and everything.  
This pride and blindness are the outcomes of sin.  
We need to reclaim within ourselves the ability to sense that there is a mystery behind everything, especially behind the divine things in the church.

Because now we think, "Oh, I know everything about the church, what the Bible says, and what the priest will tell me. I know everything." This is the biggest mistake and error we can make.  
We don’t know anything. As St. Paul said, "If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know it as he ought to know" (1 Corinthians 8:2).  
We need to remain humble and preserve a willingness to learn, to embrace more knowledge, especially about divine things.  
We need to open our inner eyes.  

So, what is the difference between Christian mysticism and occult mysticism?  
Occult mysticism often speaks of opening the "third eye," accessing four-dimensional space and time, or gaining supernatural powers through secret formulas or knowledge from places like Shangri-La or Tibet.  
They talk of a "hibicalek," a super-powerful and wise sage.  
All of this, I must say, is nonsense and holds very little value.  
Such mysticism, wizardry, and magic are against God’s will. Practices like astrology stem from Kabbalistic ideas that suggest there are special secrets to grasp in order to control the world and its movements.  
These ideas are proud, selfish, and foolish.  

Christ, on the other hand, offers the fullness of knowledge and salvation to every single person.  
We do not seek this because we lack the talent or ability on our own. We must ask God to give us the talent of faith and the desire to seek the truth.  
He is willing to give it to us—to each and every one of us—but we must ask and seek.  
Salvation is open to everyone. It is not reserved for a chosen few with special powers or abilities.  
We can become chosen by God, but only if we seek Him and ask for His blessings.  
He desires that everyone be chosen and calls everyone to this purpose.  
As Scripture says, "Many are called, but few are chosen" (Matthew 22:14). They are chosen not because God disregards others, but because others refuse to heed His call.  

Let us now consider what true mysticism is.  
There is another false type of mysticism, popular in the Middle Ages, where people claimed to have visions.  
This kind of mysticism carries a great risk: people may fall into fantasies or even be influenced by evil spirits, believing these experiences to be the most important thing.  
They may disregard the world and its needs, claiming that the material world is entirely insignificant.  
We must be careful not to fall into this extreme.  
We are not saved from this world to escape it; we are saved so that the whole world can be saved.  
We are called to minister to this world, for God cares about it and sends us into it.  
When someone becomes excessively detached, lost in otherworldly visions, it can lead to pride, mental disorder, and unhealthy spirituality.  

We need healthy spirituality, rooted in God Himself, free from fantasies and false ideas.  
We must seek answers from God alone, testing them through life and prayer.  
Our priorities must align with the Kingdom of Heaven, which guides us in our daily lives, giving us strength and direction.  
This is healthy Christian mysticism—penetrating the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven without falling into error or false ideas.  

May God help us. This is just an introduction, but I hope it is helpful to everyone. God bless.
