# The Spirit of Pharisees corrupts Christians and the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, this past Sunday is called the Sunday of the Tax Collector and the Pharisee. This whole week is dedicated to this topic to prepare us well for the Great Lent, which begins three weeks from now. The parable in Luke 18:10-14, spoken by the Lord, tells us about what He called the "yeast of the Pharisee." He warned His disciples to beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. This warning highlights a great risk to the disciples of Christ—hypocrisy—and today I want to discuss how it harms each of us, every Christian, and the Church as a whole. There are several key points to pay attention to.

First, the spirit of the Pharisee is rooted in pride and vainglory, and pride blinds a person. We see this in the Pharisee: even though he came to the Temple and believed in God, his attitude and heart were deeply flawed. He begins by thanking the Lord, but what is he thanking Him for? Not for great gifts or for helping him avoid evil, but rather for being different from other people. Just think about it—he is thanking the Lord that he is not like others: extortioners, adulterers, thieves, or even the tax collector standing nearby. This reveals the great pride and filthiness in his soul, as he accuses everyone else, claiming, "Look at me, I am good."

This is self-deception. He believes it is by his own nature that he avoids the evils he lists. But in truth, it is always a gift from the Lord. Whenever you are able to do something righteous, it is because of the Lord’s grace. He gave you your upbringing, your education, and good examples to follow. All of this enables you to do righteous things. It is not your own ability or merit. Pride leads to madness and blindness, and we see this clearly in the Pharisee. He attributes good things to himself, and this is the essence of pride.

All the evils in this world—wars, exploitation, lies, and every sin—stem from pride. Pride brings blindness and madness. People take pride in their nation, status, or other things, using them to justify themselves. No matter the context, they seek to justify themselves. The rhetoric we hear in political arguments, for example, is often rooted in pride and vainglory: "I deserve this," "I don’t deserve that," and so on. But we must not look too far outward; the biggest problem lies within us.

Because of his pride, the Pharisee fails to see his own spiritual evil. He lists the sins of others—extortion, adultery, theft—but he does not mention envy, deceit, greed, vainglory, or enmity toward others. Why? Because he is full of these evils himself, yet he is blind to them. This is complete spiritual blindness. Proud people are like this: no matter what happens, they believe they are right and just. The Pharisee justifies himself, saying, "I am just." But if you are truly just, you do not need the Lord’s justification.

In the end, the tax collector was more justified than the Pharisee. His prayer was accepted by the Lord, while the Pharisee’s prayer and sacrifice were rejected. The Pharisee was not justified; he was condemned. This parable serves as a powerful reminder for us to guard against pride and hypocrisy, to recognize that all goodness comes from the Lord, and to approach Him with humility and repentance.

If you are not justified, you are condemned. The Pharisee justified himself, and this is something we often do in our own lives. Whenever we face criticism, our immediate reaction is to defend ourselves: "No, you didn’t understand me correctly. I am much better than you think." This is our pride speaking. We are blinded by our pride and vainglory. This self-glorification, this exalting of ourselves, is the first characteristic of the spirit of the Pharisee.

The second characteristic, which applies to Christians, to each of us, and to the Church as a whole, is that it leads to idol worship. You make yourself an idol, and you make many other things idols as well. For example, if you are proud of your nation, you make your nation an idol. If you are proud of your government, you make your government an idol, and you may even subordinate the Church to serve the government. This, too, is idol worship. Bureaucracy can also become an idol—whether in the government, in companies, or even within the Church. When rules and guidelines take precedence over people, when you can justify harming others as long as it fits the guidelines, this is the spirit of idol worship.

When this spirit infiltrates the Church, it becomes particularly dangerous. An administrative or hierarchical structure that loses all sense of love and operates solely through force—"We must force you to do this and that"—is idol worship. Similarly, an obsession with titles, distinctions, or external symbols, such as special hats or crosses, turns into idol worship. When priests compare their awards or distinctions, saying, "You have this kind of cross, so you are more distinguished than I am," it becomes fetishism. A fetish is when you elevate something to an unhealthy level of importance. 

There is nothing wrong with wanting to make the Church beautiful, to reflect the Kingdom of Heaven. But when this becomes an end in itself—when the focus shifts to having more, bigger, and better things, regardless of the cost to people—it becomes idol worship. When we prioritize external appearances over love, community, and the eternal, we have lost our way. 

The same applies to an obsession with rituals and procedures. When we become fixated on doing things "the right way," following every letter of the law, we risk losing the spirit behind those practices. This is what led to the schism in the 17th century, when the Old Believers split away because they could not accept liturgical reforms. They became obsessed with the letter of the law, and this spirit of rigidity still exists today. We must be vigilant against it.

The third characteristic of the spirit of the Pharisee is the tendency to accuse everyone else, to find fault with others. We see this in the Pharisee who thanks God that he is not like other people—extortioners, adulterers, or the tax collector. In his eyes, everyone else is bad. This accusatory spirit is also prevalent in the Church today. We often look for enemies outside—Satanists, secularists, global elites, or some other external force. We blame them for all the problems, saying, "They are persecuting the Church, seducing people, and causing all the harm." This gloomy, accusatory spirit, filled with grudges, is another manifestation of the spirit of the Pharisee.

We must be careful. The spirit of the Pharisee leads to self-justification, idol worship, and a judgmental attitude toward others. It blinds us to our own faults and distorts our relationship with God and with one another. Let us guard against this spirit, striving instead for humility, love, and a focus on what is eternal.

If we possess humility and repentance, seeing ourselves as sinners, we will not be so quick to notice the sins of others. Even when we do notice something, we will not accuse or judge them. Instead, we will feel compassion, weep for them, and pray for them. We will not blame or condemn them. This is the attitude we must strive for, because when we criticize others, especially within the Church, we risk falling into the same Pharisaical spirit we are warning against. The Pharisee always believes he is the smartest, the most just, and the most righteous, while everyone else is flawed. This mindset can even manifest at the parish level. For example, when someone walks into the church dressed inappropriately, or when children are noisy during liturgy, we might think, "These people are the problem. They are disrupting my prayer." This is the spirit of the Pharisee.

The fourth and final point I want to make today is about prayer. In the Church, we are often told that it is important to pray in a beautiful way—with a nice voice, proper order, and clarity. While there is nothing wrong with this, it is not the most important aspect of prayer. What matters most is the condition of your heart. Both the Pharisee and the tax collector went to the Temple to pray, but the difference lay in their hearts. The Pharisee’s prayer was filled with pride and self-exaltation. He boasted before God, disguising his arrogance as thanksgiving. In reality, he was trying to deceive even God. The tax collector, on the other hand, saw no merit in himself. He humbly acknowledged his sinfulness and begged for God’s mercy. Even though tax collectors were known as great sinners—cheating their own people and committing many evils—the Lord forgave him because of his humility and repentance.

The Lord’s words are clear: "Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted" (Luke 18:14). The tax collector, who did not try to justify himself, was justified by God. This is the kind of prayer that God receives—a prayer rooted in humility. If we focus only on the external form of prayer—how loud or beautiful it sounds—God is not impressed. He does not accept such prayers. Often, we pray into emptiness, simply reciting words from a book or speaking to the walls. But such prayers are meaningless. In fact, God rejects them. He did not accept the Pharisee’s sacrifice, saying, in effect, "Take it back. I do not need it."

We must remember that what matters is the state of our hearts. Whether we are praying a long prayer or a short one—before a meal, after a meal, or at any other time—we must ask ourselves: What is in my heart? Am I just saying these words out of obligation, or am I truly repentant? Am I standing before the Lord with humility, trembling in awe of His majesty? May the Lord grant us such a heart. May He teach us humility and guide us in prayer. And as we prepare to enter the Great Lent this year, may He help us do so with humble and contrite hearts.

May the Lord help us navigate every challenge we face and transform us into His true disciples—those who are chosen, His children, and heirs of His heavenly kingdom. Let us refrain from accusing others. When we see issues within the Church, we must not judge. Judgment is not our role. Instead, we should focus on correcting what we can within ourselves, avoiding mistakes, and striving to grow in holiness. Even when we encounter wrong attitudes or spirits in others, our response should be one of compassion and prayer. We must begin with ourselves, seeking to change and grow spiritually.

We must remain spiritually awake and vigilant, recognizing that the spirit of the Pharisee is like a sickness or a virus. If we are not careful, this virus can infect us, and we may become Pharisees ourselves, even while calling ourselves Christians—Orthodox Christians, devout Christians. Merely identifying as such means nothing unless we cultivate humility and truly follow the Lord, seeking His mercy, guidance, healing, and salvation.

May the Lord help each of us, bless us, and guide us on this path. May He grant us the grace to overcome pride and hypocrisy, and to walk in humility and love. God bless you all. Amen.
