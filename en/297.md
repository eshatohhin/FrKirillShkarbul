# Homo Interneticus - Servant of the Mammon

Dear brothers and sisters, we are now entering the Great Lent. The last Sunday before Lent is called the Sunday of Adam's Exile. We recall how Adam and Eve were chased out of the Garden of Eden and had to go through deep repentance.  

The whole of humanity had to endure thousands of years of repentance and the search for the true God, eventually receiving salvation through Christ. In the same way, we will walk the path of the Great Lent with deep repentance, with a longing for the Lord, for salvation, and for reconciliation with Him. We open ourselves to the Eternal, asking for the Spirit of God to descend upon us, to cleanse us of all impurity, and to transform every weakness, sin, passion, and everything that is old and unfit for the Kingdom of God.  

This path of transformation is not merely about what we eat or do not eat. Yes, fasting is called fasting because we abstain from certain foods and eat less. We begin the recovery of our will by restraining our desires—starting with the most basic ones, such as our craving for tasty food and the desire to eat until we are full. This is necessary, absolutely necessary. But there are other things we sometimes treat as mere additions or bonuses.  

However, these are not mere additions. Today, I want to talk not about food but about fasting from digital things—our dependency on digital content and our immersion in this virtual world. To fight and overcome this, we must understand how harmful, deadly, and poisonous these things are. Why are they so dangerous? What is the issue? You might ask, "What is so bad about using the internet?" Today, I want to address this.  

In my last two videos, I spoke about Gnosticism and how occultists, driven by the spirit of the devil, seek to destroy this world and build another one more suited to the spirit of Satan. Most major wars and revolutions have this spirit behind them. It incited the bourgeois revolutions, the Reformation, the Soviet Communist Revolution, and, of course, the two World Wars. But all these events are in the past.  

What is more recent is what happened after World War II—the generation of baby boomers—and what is happening now. There was a significant transition in the world with the baby boomers. What we observe is that for the spirit of evil, the spirit of the Antichrist, to destroy one world and build another, it must rely on people. It cannot rely solely on a few individuals, such as a secret government or even the entire elite. If the entire ruling class conspires to do something, they will fail unless the general public is prepared for it.  

This is where the responsibility of each of us comes into play for what is happening in the world. The preparation of an entire generation of people capable of dismantling the old world and building a new one takes decades. Before discussing our current problem—the problem of the internet—let us briefly talk about the baby boomers.  

In the West, the baby boomers destroyed the previous world. That world was industrial, more Christian than it is today. It had values, traditions, morals, a sense of family, an understanding of sin and evil, dignity, responsibility toward society and fellow citizens, and love for their homeland. Although it was modernist and gnostic in some ways, it retained many Christian elements. This is evident in movies, books, and other cultural artifacts. It was a world that opposed war, having experienced the horrors of World War II.  

However, the new generation—the children of these war veterans, the baby boomers—lacked these values. They were cynical, even more modernist, placing full trust in technology. They were techno-optimists, carefree, less mechanical, and more organic. They ushered in a post-industrial, post-Christian, post-humanist era. They destroyed the old world and brought forth a new one—let us call it the Hollywood world—a global, international paradigm without a sense of sin. This paved the way for globalization.  

In the Soviet bloc and other former Orthodox countries, the baby boomers also brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union. These people no longer believed in ideals, the common good, or anything beyond personal gain. For them, consumption, enjoyment, individualism, and mammonism became the new paradigm. Based on this cynicism, the Soviet Union was successfully dismantled. A similar process occurred in Asia and other parts of the world.  

In essence, the world as we know it today—the world of globalization after the fall of the Berlin Wall—is also a product of the baby boomers. I am simplifying many things here; you could divide it into more generations and paradigms, but let us keep it simple.  

Then comes the generation of Homo Interneticus. This is not about age but about involvement in this new paradigm. Many baby boomers have also become Homo Interneticus, but it is primarily the next generation. Even within this group, there are different generations of internet users with varying habits and characteristics. But let us not delve into details and lose sight of the bigger picture.  

The bigger picture is that we now have Homo Interneticus. What is Homo Interneticus? What is this new type of person who has been created and now forms the foundation for this ongoing transformation? This transformation began roughly around the time of the pandemic, though it started a bit earlier. The active stage began with the pandemic, and we have been living in a state of constant crisis and war ever since. This is the reality we face today.

Transition period. And what is the basis for this transition period? It's the Homo Interneticus. Let us explore what this means.

Homo Interneticus. First, for this individual, the virtual is more real than the physical. The physical world becomes merely an addendum.

It becomes just an extension of what is happening online. It's what I can buy online. It's the people I can meet online.

It's my hobbies. It's my movies. It's everything that I enjoy, that gives me safety, that gives me meaning.

It's all in there. You don't have to be someone who plays games incessantly. Even if you're just a normal, regular person, chances are you are Homo Interneticus.

Because most of the things that concern you, your heart will be there. Let's put it that way. And this is why we have such a significant problem with the family.

Because people don't want families. Families involve real people in front of you. And that's responsibility.

That's reality. And that's a burden. Children are a burden.

Maybe when I become old, I need something to play with. I have a child. Maybe, yes.

Just for fun. So, we can talk a lot about it. But let's return to the point.

For Homo Interneticus, there are no boundaries. They become more cosmopolitan. They treat all governmental matters as just part of the game.

Everything is a game. For Homo Interneticus, life becomes more and more like a game. Quests, challenges to overcome, levels, progressing from one level to another.

And if you are killed, come again. If you are bankrupt, come again. Or change the country of your residence.

And everything else is an obstacle. You kill them. Or you collect some bonuses.

It's a game. You are self-motivated by these things. And humans lose their value.

What value does an avatar on Facebook have? Tomorrow, delete, forget. And the same goes for the people around you. They are just avatars around you.

I'm just surfing through life. I surf the internet. I don't care if they die, or whatever happens to them.

I don't care. Because I see death every time I watch these movies. Action.

I play games, killing people. For me, death is nothing. It's like a game.

The whole life is easy-going, like a game. Not even valuing your own life very often. So basically, no breaks.

For Homo Interneticus, no breaks. Because you can do everything fast, immediately. Push a button.

So temperance. We're coming back to the idea of the Great Lent. We have passions, everyone.

And for Homo Interneticus, it becomes just a matter of seconds. Click. And you can realize any passion.

So you become possessed by all your passions. Unless you fight against that. Unless you are conscious of that.

You are drawn by your passions instantly. And you are locked by that. You become a slave.

A spiritual slave. Much faster. And you become blind, brainwashed much faster than otherwise.

Knowledge. There is no need for real knowledge. All your knowledge comes from bloggers.

You don't do any research. You don't need to study big textbooks or listen to lectures. That's boring, that's difficult.

No. Everybody is easy to explain. What? He is a good guy, he is a bad guy.

I got it. So what is this going to lead us to? And what can we do? You can say, well, everybody is like this. Are we going to be like Luddites, retreating to caves or something? First of all, the Holy Scripture tells us that the temptation will come like a net.

It will cover everyone. And also, it's like the darkness. After sunset, everything gets dark very fast.

You cannot run away. It's just dark. Fast.

So this temptation with this Homo Interneticus is like that. It's coming upon everyone. Unless you have the light.

This is why Christians loved all-night vigils. Because they could be conscious of having the light while it's darkness for the whole world. So if we want to be saved in this era of Homo Interneticus, we need to be with Christ as much as we can.

With our whole heart. Approach Him, strive for Him, crave Him. Otherwise, we will be swept by this darkness.

What is this like? This is like... Let's say you are a big sinner. Let's say you are a thief. Or you are an adulterer.

For many years. Today you repent, you come to Christ. You want to live a holy life.

You do live this holy life. But you need to remember, you need to be conscious of what you were before. Otherwise, you will slip into that very quickly.

You are a thief. You've made so many people cry. And you have this thing, possess this, grasp that, steal that for nothing.

And nothing is going to happen. You have that in your character, built into you somewhere very deep. Unless you are conscious of that and you repent of that, you will not change fundamentally.

You will not receive that healing, and you will not recover. It's not just like that, okay? It's a lot of prayer and humbleness, humiliating ourselves. So if we want to overcome all those harms, all that threat that was brought to us by us becoming Homo Interneticus, we need to be conscious of that.

We need to be fighting with those things inside us. With those dependencies. We need to understand that our mind is blown away.

The noose is just destroyed. It's so weak. We need to be conscious of that.

That our heart is blind and stiff and hard. And our consciousness is burned out. We need to know that.

Otherwise, we will be just playing, just pretending that we are fasting, that we are Christians. And no real healing will take place. Eventually, this society of Homo Interneticus will lead to the breaking of all governments, all moralities, all religions.

And it will suck everyone into this new anti-Christian paradigm of worshipping Satan. It will be called differently. It will be called something else.

But in reality, that's what's going to happen. Like with the sects and heretics. Most of them are satanists.

But most heretics and sects don't say we are a sect, we worship the devil. No, they say we worship God, we are pious and stuff like that. But they do worship the devil.

And the same thing will happen with the whole world. An important thing to understand is that the more these Gnostics are able to create this new type of man, the more this man will tend towards self-destruction. The more we are Homo Interneticus, the more we will suffer, we will be alienated from others, we will be harming ourselves every day, every moment, through passions, through many things.

We will be hurting and harming ourselves. This is the state of the Gnostic *homo interneticus*, the person destined for destruction. On a spiritual level, the Lord will certainly withdraw His Spirit from such people.  

They will be like the dust or ash blown by the wind, as we read in the Psalms—so temporal, so unreal, so shallow. This is what is happening now with many people.  

Especially after the pandemic, this has become so evident. So many people are "hacked," and each and every one of us is included, to some degree.  

From a spiritual perspective, we also see that *homo interneticus* cannot grasp eternity. It is much flatter, more down-to-earth.  

In the sense that everything revolves around things in this world—whether it be consumption, politics, health, or whatever else, it is all here. Even occultism, esotericism, and things like that.  

Behind every passion, there is a spirit. Do not be mistaken; there is a very strong spirit at work.  

But this spirit is deprived of the Spirit of God, of truth. This is why, in every respect, people lose their culture, their honor. They become very superficial, very dependent on everything, and afraid of everything.  

May the Lord keep us away from the spirit of this world, from Gnosticism, and from this overexposure to the internet. Let us reduce our exposure to only what is necessary. As soon as we feel any dependency, let us cut off that exposure entirely.  

During this Great Lent, let us ask the Lord to heal our souls, to bring us out of prison, to bring us out of this darkness, and to keep us in light and holiness.  

Grant us true repentance. Grant us true knowledge—the true knowledge of truth. Make us His beloved children, not children of this fallen world.  

Amen. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
