# The Leaven of Pharisees and of Sadducees in Us

Dear brothers and sisters, we remember that the Lord told His disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees. What does this mean for us today? And how is this related to the temptations that we need to go through? Today, I want to share with you some thoughts, both on an individual level and on the church level.

First, let's take a look at Mark chapter 8, verses 13 to 15: "And He left them, and entering into the ship again, departed to the other side. Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread; neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. And He charged them, saying, 'Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.' And they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'It is because we have no bread.'"

The same story appears in Matthew 16:5-12, with some extra details. There, the Lord speaks about the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees, not Herod, but most likely it is the same thing. At the end, the disciples understood that He was talking about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Today, we don't have Pharisees and Sadducees around, but both of their spirits are very much with us. The Lord is saying that this is like leaven—I could say it's like a virus—it's spreading and becoming stronger. The Lord also called the message of the Kingdom of God the "leaven of the Kingdom of Heaven," as mentioned in Matthew 13:33.

So, we can say that both in our hearts and in the church, and in the world for that matter, there are these three leavens competing in a sense: the leaven of the Gospel, which we hear when we embrace the Gospel and want to follow Christ. However, it is choked very quickly in most people, either by the leaven of the Pharisees or the leaven of the Sadducees. Even in the disciples, we will see in a moment that the Lord was testing them, and He discovered that they had the leaven of the Sadducees especially.

We can talk a lot about what this means, as there are different interpretations, but I want to make it straightforward and simple. The leaven of the Pharisees is when our religious life becomes separated from our real life. The Pharisees had external rules; they wanted to have a contract with God: "We do this, this, and this—613 commandments—we keep all those commandments." That's why they were united with the lawyers, often connected with them in the Gospel. Those lawyers knew the law of God, and they had this table of commandments, which was very legalistic.

This is what we have in the Catholic Church and in the Orthodox Church. Unfortunately, many people have that legalistic mindset: "How much sin is this? Is this a big sin or a small sin? What do you do to compensate for these sins?" And the bigger problem is the split between the external and the real, the so-called holy and unholy. For example, we go to church—this is a holy place, this is holy time—now I pretend I'm holy; this is public, everybody can see me. But when I go out or when I go home, I can be a devil; I can be whatever. It doesn't really matter; yes, I will repent, but basically, I have a switch. Even in the church, I can be a devil inside; I can judge others, I can do everything, but I will pretend. I will drink holy water, I will do this, this, and this, put a candle, and pretend I'm a holy one.

So, this separation—and all of us have it, all of us have it—you could even test it when you pray. Do you pray just the prayer that you're supposed to pray? Is your heart somewhere else? Be honest with yourself. You're not really talking to the Lord when you pray. This is very evident in the spirit. Our heart is somewhere else; our mind is somewhere else. This is why we're so unstable, because we have that split. And this is related to the spirit of Cain, because he had that mindset: "I sacrifice to the Lord good things, but I keep some for myself." So, this is keeping something for myself—this is mine, don't worry. This is against the plan of God; this is against the way of salvation. This is why He did not accept the sacrifice of Cain.

This whole idea of creating my own world and just using God for my sake is basically leading to paganism eventually. But still, it's trying to pretend; it's trying to keep something. Also, the Pharisee spirit very often talks about external rules, and it's often more traditionalist, more conservative. Most conservatives are Pharisees. This is why the Lord was accusing them. I'm not against tradition—no, it's not the problem of tradition. It's the problem of how you take it. You don't have the spirit of it; you only have the letter. You take these traditions, canons, or whatever, just to hit somebody's head. That's why the Lord told them, "You're using your earthly commandments to substitute, to annihilate the commandment of God."

The thing is, the Pharisee spirit—which is in all of us, just be honest with yourself—we are all Pharisees; we are all hypocrites in many circumstances, due to our vanity, our lack of spirituality, and for many other reasons. Essentially, it is separation. What it means is that you are far away from Christ. There is no living relationship with the truth. You are not bearing the truth in yourself; you're fake. You can be poked and exposed, showing that you are filthy. Your real wishes, your real mindset, are far from being Christian. And this can eventually lead you to the Herodian or the Sadducee spirit—the leaven of the Sadducees. They are related; they are connected.

What is the leaven of the Sadducees? The Sadducees were materialists. They denied the resurrection and the spiritual world, believing that everything is confined to what we see here and now. It was a form of religious materialism, akin to Marxism, where people worship entities like the Communist Party, Lenin, production, progress, and efficiency—idols of a materialistic worldview. Similarly, in capitalism, people worship capital, production, human capital, technology, and industrial revolutions. It’s all about seeking paradise in this world, and this is what gives them comfort and assurance. Essentially, they are materialists. You can claim to be a Christian every day, waving a banner that says, "I’m Christian," but if your mindset is materialistic, you are living the leaven of the Sadducees.

We can see this materialistic mindset even in the apostles. For example, you might refuse to act until you have a budget because you believe in money. You think, "If we have the money, then we can begin. No money? Then nothing is possible." This is because you trust only in material things; you don’t trust the Lord. You trust Mammon instead. This was the reason the Jews crucified Christ and why they betrayed Him so many times, turning to pagan gods. Remember the event in the desert during the 40 years of wandering? The Israelites tested God, putting Him in temptation by complaining to Moses, "We have no water; we are thirsty; we will die here. Why did you bring us here?" By saying this, they were essentially demanding, "If the God you speak of is Almighty, let Him perform a miracle and save us here by giving us water. If He can do that, then we’ll believe He’s Almighty. Otherwise, we don’t need Him; we don’t trust Him." This is tempting God—an anti-Christian mindset. This is why they later said to Jesus, "Come down from the cross, and we will believe You." They were asking for signs, demanding a materialistic, powerful Messiah—a ruler of this world. From the time in the desert, the Lord was trying to save at least some from this stubborn materialistic mindset. A few were saved, but very few. Today, we cannot expect everyone to be free from this mindset. Why aren’t all Christians truly following Christ? Why are there so many heresies? It’s because many want Mammon, not Christ. Most of us are like this, and we need to be honest with ourselves.

This is why the Lord sends temptations. Even when He was with His disciples, He tested them. In John 6:5-7, we see the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000. Before performing this miracle, Jesus tested Philip. "When Jesus then lifted up His eyes and saw a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, 'Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?' But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do. Philip answered Him, 'Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.'" Philip immediately began calculating: so many people, how much bread would be needed? He thought, "Even if we had 200 denarii, it wouldn’t be enough for everyone to have even a small snack." Philip failed this test because of the leaven of the Sadducees—the materialistic mindset that trusts in money and resources rather than in the Lord’s provision.

Because of that materialistic spirit, Philip failed the test. We know Philip was quite materialistic. When the Lord told him, "You know the Father," Philip responded, "Where? Show us the Father, and that will be enough." Jesus replied, "Philip, you have been with Me for so long, and yet you say you don’t know the Father?" So, Philip had a materialistic mindset. But what was the purpose of Jesus asking him this question? Later, Philip would reflect on what had happened. He had calculated beforehand that only with a certain amount of money could the miracle be possible. It would become evident to him that his lack of faith was not in line with what Jesus was preaching. Through this, Philip would grow in faith.

All the temptations the Lord sends us every day are opportunities for us to grow in faith and to rid ourselves of the leaven of the Sadducees and Pharisees. When we face sorrow, we should not complain but receive it and face it. This will help us become more humble and sincere, moving away from the Pharisee spirit of pretending, of acting like an actor. This transformation comes through pain and suffering. Similarly, with the Sadducee spirit, when we face difficulties and struggles—when we don’t know how to live or if we’ll have enough money next month—we shouldn’t panic or scold others. Instead, we need to trust the Lord. In hardship, we entrust ourselves to Him. Yes, we do what we can, but our trust is in the Lord. We don’t fall into depression, anxiety, or fear because of material lack.

The Pharisee spirit often brings conservatism and formalism, while the Sadducee spirit leans toward materialism. The Sadducee spirit can manifest as liberalism, where everything goes as long as it brings benefit. This can lead to ecumenism, which, in essence, is spiritual adultery. It means compromising with everyone for the sake of gain: "We’re good with these people, we’re good with sects, with Buddhists, so we can obtain some benefit here and there." Another manifestation is becoming a "prostitute of the government," surrendering our faith to those in power because they have resources. This can lead to autocratic or totalitarian behavior, as we worship power, might, and financial resources. This is also the Sadducee spirit.

Often, the Pharisee and Sadducee spirits are intertwined. The Pharisee can also be liberal, as seen in the two famous schools of thought in Judaism: Shammai (conservative) and Hillel (liberal). But to avoid confusion, the key point is that both spirits are something we need to work on and watch out for. Whether in our family, parish, or church, we must recognize when these spirits are present. Whenever we are not loyal to Christ or to the truth, we betray the Gospel. We prevent the leaven of the Kingdom of Heaven from having its effect, from raising the bread and bringing forth fruit. The Lord is waiting for us to bear fruit, but these spirits eliminate Christ from our lives.

The Pharisee spirit is the first step, and the Sadducee spirit is the second step, which represents complete enmity toward Christ. You replace Him entirely with the surrogate of Mammon, yet you might still think you’re a Christian. This is a dangerous delusion. The Sadducees, for example, still thought of themselves as pious Jews, yet they were doing the exact opposite of what the Lord had preached throughout the Old Testament. What Jesus taught was not entirely new; it was a continuation of the truth revealed in the Old Testament. The Sadducees, however, had replaced that truth with materialism and power, leading them to oppose Christ entirely. 

In summary, we must guard against both the Pharisee and Sadducee spirits. They hinder our relationship with Christ, prevent us from bearing fruit, and ultimately lead us away from the truth. Through trials and temptations, we are called to grow in faith, humility, and sincerity, trusting in the Lord rather than in material things or external appearances.

This was preached throughout the Old Testament, and yet they were in direct contradiction with it. Still, they were able to rationalize it in their minds. This is the deception of the devil. Let us remain faithful to Christ. Let us overthrow all these things—clean out all the filthy leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, this idol worship—and become true witnesses of Christ, His love, and His truth.

May the Lord be with us, brothers and sisters. God bless.
