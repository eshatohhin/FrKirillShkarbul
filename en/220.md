# Why emptiness & surrogates come from satanism

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to speak about one of the important aspects of darkness, of the evil in this world, because very often we fail to notice it. We recognize evil when it manifests as war, immoral behavior, or something harmful, sick, or bad. We see evil in such forms. However, evil often comes in the guise of emptiness. Today, I want to provide examples that illustrate how today's world is built on this emptiness.

We live in a culture that is fake, empty, pseudo-cultural, and even anti-cultural—destructive, in essence. We have a surrogate of science, where most scientific papers could soon be written by ChatGPT, or already are to a large extent. About 85 to 90 percent of publications lack genuine scientific breakthroughs, especially in the humanities, but this issue is not confined to them; it extends to the physical sciences as well.

There is also a significant problem with religions. Many religious organizations that were once influential now retain only their outward form, while behind them lies the same emptiness—driven by greed, prestige, or business interests. Often, it is merely about making money. Many who preach do not truly believe in their message; they have different goals and simply happen to be in that role. This results in fake, surrogate religions, surrogate monasticism, and even surrogate patriotism. There are many such surrogates.

We witnessed this in 2020 when many people and organizations accepted the prevailing narrative without resistance. Large institutions, which people hoped would stand for certain ideas and values, failed to act. They complied entirely with the agenda, revealing a troubling emptiness at their core. This emptiness operates on both social and individual levels.

Today, I want to highlight a significant example: the Nazis. They presented themselves as patriots of their nation, and many Germans hoped that the spirit of Germany, the *Geist*, would flourish under their rule. The Nazis were seen as saviors, overthrowing greedy capitalists who exploited the masses. They promised a new ideology, a vision, and breakthrough ideas for creating a better world. Many were captivated by this vision, but it ended in catastrophe.

From 1933 to 1939, Germany appeared prosperous. Its industry and technology advanced, and a strong sense of patriotism united the nation. This seemed to promise new ideas, philosophies, and solutions to humanity's problems. However, it culminated in concentration camps, a machine of terror and death that enslaved Europe, invaded Russia and Ukraine, and caused immeasurable suffering. The aftermath of this satanic ideology and its processes still affects us today, and it is not a positive legacy.

This serves as a stark reminder of how emptiness and surrogates can lead to devastating consequences, both historically and in our present world.

We have not learned most of these lessons, unfortunately. The sooner we recognize this emptiness, the sooner we can stop it and avoid the traumatic casualties and suffering that inevitably follow. What we saw with the Nazis was fake patriotism, fake philosophy, and fake religion. Essentially, all this fakeness, all these surrogates, originate from the devil. It is all satanism and a direct opposition to God. Emptiness is never truly empty; if you create a void, the devil will fill it.

This includes the communists and Marxists, who sought to destroy everything and build something new from the ground up. Their drive to root out and dismantle existing structures stems from this same idea of emptiness. We can also see this in the Reformation, which aimed to destroy much of what came before. As a result, they left behind no asceticism, no monasticism, no tradition—only a few limited dogmas, pride, and blindness. This is why they continue to divide and fragment.

Modernism was founded on emptiness, and as a consequence, post-modernism and post-post-modernism have emerged. Where are we heading now? We are witnessing the ongoing development of this process. On a generational level, newer generations appear increasingly shallow, avoiding responsibility, constantly changing their place, work, profession, or even their partners and spouses. The Lord once said, "Adulterous and sinful generation, how long will I endure you?" That was 2,000 years ago, and now the situation is far worse. This adulterous nature stems from emptiness, and it is a form of Satanism.

Even in the Old Testament, when the Jews betrayed their faith, the Lord said, "You are worshipping Satan—Beelzebub, Baal, or whatever name you give it." Any religion that does not accept God and Christ is Satanism. Satanism is not always explicit; it is not always about openly declaring, "I worship Satan." Rather, it manifests in the rejection of God and the embrace of emptiness, which the devil exploits. This is the root of the problem we face today.

Indeed, Satanism can take many forms, and it doesn’t always involve explicit worship. You don’t even have to worship anything directly—simply making money the core of your life, serving it, and prioritizing it above all else is enough. Some might say, "I don’t care about money; I just want what it gives me." But this is the same thing—consumption, mammon, becomes the focus. Whether it’s money, career, vainglory, or any other idol, every idol has a demon behind it, and this makes you a slave to Satan. This is a form of Satanism, or what some might call Luciferianism.

When it comes to religions, many reject God outright. For example, in Buddhism, the first thing they often say is, "There is no God, and now we can discuss other things." This rejection of God leads them to conclude that emptiness is the foundation of everything. This is no coincidence, because when you reject God, you are left with emptiness, and where there is emptiness, the devil steps in. This is the nature of many manifestations of Satanism in our lives.

On an individual level, I don’t mean to criticize or mock anyone, but when people become shallow and consumed by earthly interests, they become empty. This, too, is a form of Satanism—whether conscious, unconscious, or subconscious. It is a ministry to the devil. After World War II, society became increasingly consumerist. We thought, "We’ve won the war, Nazism is over, and everything is resolved." But in reality, consumerism spread globally, regardless of whether a country was capitalist or socialist. Even socialist countries, through materialism, became worshippers of Satan via consumerism, often more intensely than capitalist nations.

We can see the effects of this in the newer generations—millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha. There is a sense of rootlessness, as though they lack a foundation. This lack of rootedness is a sign of the success of Satanism in our society. It’s important to understand that this emptiness isn’t truly empty—it can be very creative and productive, but in destructive ways. For example, I’ve visited Japan many times and noticed something striking: in hostels, you might see 50 older men in their 50s or 60s spending entire days reading comics. These comics are mass-produced, filled with demonic imagery, and far from anything inspired by God. Yet people love them, which reveals the emptiness within them. This is just one example, but it’s a global phenomenon, and nowhere is immune to it.

This emptiness is not passive; it actively shapes culture, values, and individuals. It is a tool of Satan, and we must recognize it for what it is. Only by filling our lives with God, truth, and genuine purpose can we resist this pervasive emptiness and its destructive consequences.

This is just one example, but there are countless others. Take music, for instance. You see so many different singers, so much variety, and yet, beneath the surface, it’s all the same. It’s not truly empty in the sense of being silent or inactive, but it is empty in its essence. There’s a hollowness behind it, a lack of depth and meaning. This is the emptiness we must learn to recognize and avoid. We must not become victims of pseudo-culture, pseudo-patriotism, pseudo-religion, or any other form of imitation. True religion is union with our Lord Jesus Christ—a genuine union that comes through prayer and the Holy Communion. If you receive the body and blood of Christ, you will not have emptiness; life will be in you.

It’s also important to distinguish between the emptiness of the world and the peace and quietness of asceticism that the Church teaches. The Holy Fathers speak of this stillness, where we silence our thoughts, emotions, and desires to enter into the mystery of God. This is not emptiness but a state of passionlessness, where we can hear the Lord, speak to Him, and receive His revelation. This is entirely different from the chaotic stream of thoughts and imperatives that drive us in the world—where we run around all day, accomplishing nothing in the eyes of the Lord because we act for ourselves, not for Him. This is futility, emptiness, and it leads us away from God, toward hell.

Let us learn to distinguish between true emptiness—the satanic void that leads to destruction—and the simplicity of heart that comes from the Spirit of God. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. This purity is not emptiness; it is freedom from blemish, from the garbage that fills our hearts. May we strive for this purity, avoiding the dangers of the world’s emptiness, and remain ready for the ministry of the Lord. Let us bear the fruits He expects from us, living a life of true mission and purpose, not one of futility and emptiness. God bless us all.
