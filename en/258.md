# What is Blasphemy towards the Holy Spirit

To you, brothers and sisters, Christ is risen.  
Today, I want to begin a very important topic, which is also closely related to the Holy Resurrection, Pascha, that we are celebrating.  

On Pascha, Christ appeared to His disciples and told them, "Peace be with you."  
He breathed upon them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."  
And they received the Holy Spirit and understood the prophecies.  
From that moment, they became apostles.  

We also remember that after Pentecost, we are now reading the Acts of the Apostles during this time. The apostles went out and testified about Jesus Christ, but the scribes and Pharisees tried to stop them. They attempted to prevent the apostles, but the Lord had blessed those who received the Holy Spirit, and they could not withstand the Holy Spirit.  
They could not oppose or prevent the Holy Spirit from working through people.  

The entire book of the Acts of the Apostles is about the fruits of the Holy Spirit, which was poured abundantly upon the early Church. The Holy Spirit continues to live in the Church to this day.  

This is why, during these blessed days, I want to reflect with you on blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  
What is it?  
Why did the Lord say that any sin may be forgiven, but not the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?  
What does it mean?  

Today, we will begin to uncover this topic. In my next video, I want to delve deeper, bringing more examples and theological reflections from the Holy Fathers, as well as an ascetic understanding of this topic.  
But today, let us begin so that we may better understand this sin, be careful not to fall into it ourselves, and recognize it in the world. This sin is far worse than any other.  

Let us read from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 3, verses 28-30.  
The context here is that the Lord is healing those who are demon-possessed, casting out demons. The scribes and Pharisees come and accuse Him, saying He does this by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.  
In response, the Lord says to them:  
"Amen, I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherever they blaspheme. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven but is subject to eternal condemnation, because they said He has an unclean spirit."  

He tells them that this sin is unforgivable.  
Why is this?  
Can’t any sin be forgiven if we repent?  
Yes, that is true.  
However, the translation here sometimes fails to convey the full meaning of the original text.  
The original meaning is that those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven—ever.  
But this does not mean that if someone commits this sin once, they can never be forgiven.  
Rather, it means that as long as they remain in that state—as long as their heart, disposition, and attitude toward the Holy Spirit remain unchanged—they cannot be forgiven.  

Their sin cannot be forgiven because they reject God’s mercy.  
Even if others pray for them, even if the Lord offers them His mercy, they will not be forgiven.  
Why?  
Because they reject this mercy.  

Let us take this step by step.

So, the first understanding—the historical or literal meaning of this passage—tells us that if there are fruits of the Holy Spirit, these fruits could manifest in various ways. For example, they could include casting out demons, living a virtuous life, or the works of the saints. It could also encompass the life of the Church, such as when the Church proclaims the truth and bears witness to love, or when the holy martyrs were driven by the Holy Spirit.  

There are countless fruits of the Holy Spirit. However, if you attribute these fruits to demons or the devil—if you flip this truth on its head—even though you may intuitively sense that these works come from God, your wretched, evil heart, driven by enmity or jealousy, leads you to attribute them to demons. This is blasphemy. You attempt to humiliate or speak negatively about what is holy, true, and just. This disrespectful attitude and negative words or actions against something sacred constitute blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  

There are numerous examples of this. For instance, consider a Christian who has turned away from sin and now lives a humble, virtuous, and chaste life. Others observe that he no longer engages in the reckless behavior he once did—he is quiet and humble. Yet, they accuse him of being demon-possessed. Deep down, they know this accusation is false, but they persist in their satanic zeal to reject the fruits of the Holy Spirit. They speak negatively and slanderously, hoping to sow doubt in others, diverting them away from holiness and virtue.  

This kind of attitude is not merely a sin; it is an active fight against the manifested fruits of the Holy Spirit. It is a grave sin.  

Now, let us consider another fundamental aspect of this. The Holy Spirit is called the *life-giving Spirit*. The Holy Spirit brings true life. Those who are spiritually dead—those who do not live with the Lord or seek the kingdom of heaven—are dead because they lack the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does not work within them.  

The life-giving Spirit gives life and raises people from death. The Holy Spirit unites us with Christ, brings consolation, hope, and light, and calls everyone to salvation. This is the breath of the Lord—it is God Himself. Those who do not have the Holy Spirit do not want it. They remain in darkness, in the shadow of death, bound by the shackles of sin.  

The Holy Spirit brings salvation and calls everyone to it. Therefore, if you reject the Holy Spirit, you are rejecting salvation itself. You are rejecting healing and true life. Your life remains devoid of light, filled only with darkness, and you actively oppose the work of the Spirit.  

This state cannot be forgiven because you do not desire forgiveness. You reject salvation. The Lord cannot save you against your will. This is the most terrible and dangerous state—when a person chooses to oppose salvation. They do not want life, light, or healing.  

Humans can become so hardened, so demon-like, that they reject the Holy Spirit even when they see its message clearly. They recognize the call to repentance, the evident truth of salvation and righteousness coming from God Himself, yet they say, "No, I do not want this." They use vile words—words I will not repeat—to express their rejection.  

This is the essence of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit: a deliberate, willful rejection of the life-giving work of God, a refusal to accept the salvation and light He offers. It is a state of rebellion that cuts one off from the possibility of forgiveness, not because God is unwilling to forgive, but because the individual refuses to accept it.
