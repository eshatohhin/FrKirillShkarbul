# The Lord “blinds your mind” Cognitive Distortions

Dear brothers and sisters, last week there was no video because I was on a mission trip to China and had just returned.  
The Orthodox Church is growing there and becoming stronger in faith.  
More people are actively organizing services, even without priests.  
It is very inspiring to see how the Lord is working in this country, where preaching Orthodoxy is still illegal.  
It truly reminds us of the days of Nero and Trajan, and all those emperors who made Christianity illegal and forbidden.  
Please pray for the mission in China.  

Today, I want to share something important, especially during these holy days of Advent.  
We are preparing for Christmas, which is approaching. In the Orthodox Church, January 6th is Christmas Eve, and January 7th is Christmas Day.  
As we continue on this path, let us reflect deeply on the Lord’s coming and why some did not receive Him.  
One of the key issues here is the problem of the mind and the heart.  
Sometimes, the mind understands things but does not want to accept them because the heart is corrupted.  
The heart does not love God.  
For example, the high priests understood that Jesus was the Messiah, but their hearts belonged to the devil.  
That is why they did not receive Him as the Messiah.  

This happens every day with each of us, and it is called cognitive distortion.  
These distortions are used by all kinds of manipulators, from advertising to propaganda, in the media and elsewhere.  
I think you are familiar with this.  
It is often studied from the perspective of psychology or sociology.  
However, the Holy Fathers have provided us with many important insights into the human soul and why these things occur.  
We often have a rationalistic mindset, believing that if someone does not understand something, we simply need to explain it to them.  
This is why we emphasize public education—so people can become more intelligent and knowledgeable.  
We believe that more public information will solve problems.  
However, this does not always work. In fact, it can sometimes make things worse.  

There is a paradox here.  
Today, we have more education than ever before. Almost no one is illiterate.  
Everyone can read, and basic education is compulsory.  
Many people hold degrees, master’s degrees, doctorates, and more.  
Yet, the level of foolishness in the world is alarming.  
We have more wars, more moral degradation, and more tragedies than ever before.  
People are killing their children, divorcing, and engaging in all kinds of destructive behaviors.  
The Apostle Paul connects this to the rejection of Christ.  

As we await Christ’s coming, we see the manger and remember His birth.  
The Apostle Paul said that the Gentiles did not receive the Lord because their hearts were attached to the worthless things of this world.  
Their minds were darkened and blinded, leading them into all kinds of immoral behavior—corruption, depravity, and more.  
This is what is happening on a large scale today.  

There is a clear relationship here:  
Receiving Christ and accepting Him as Savior and Messiah,  
a darkened mind when He is rejected,  
a heart attached to worldly things,  
and moral degradation.  
These four elements are interconnected, as the Apostle Paul explains.  
This sheds light on much of what we see in the world today.  

We will also discuss the way out of this.  
First, let me provide some examples.  
One common issue is that we perceive problems in others but fail to see them in ourselves.  
We accuse others of wrongdoing, believing that they are the ones with problems.  
We do not notice our own faults.  
But if we think logically, we realize that we are often worse, yet we fail to see it.

We don’t want to see it, we don’t understand it, and we ignore it.  
Another issue is placing ourselves as the most important thing in the world.  
It is natural for humans to perceive the world egocentrically.  
From my perspective, I am at the center because I experience the world through my own eyes.  
This seems logical, and so I conclude that I am the most important.  
However, if we had a truly logical mind, we would understand that this is merely a perspective.  
In reality, it is not true—I am not the most important, nor am I at the center.  
But we don’t want to think this way.  
Our hearts are filled with pride and vainglory, which blinds us.  
We mistakenly believe we are at the center, which is a distortion.  

Another common distortion is stereotyping.  
We create stereotypes, which originally served as a mental shortcut for our brains.  
For example, if we can identify common characteristics of a group—whether a nation, social group, or profession like taxi drivers or bureaucrats—we think we understand them.  
However, with a healthy mind and heart, we would recognize that every individual is unique.  
We would assess whether a stereotype applies to a specific person.  
But we often fail to do this.  
Instead, we say, “Oh, he’s a bureaucrat, so I know everything about him,” or “She’s a woman, so I understand her behavior.”  
This rigid thinking makes our minds inflexible and blind.  
We stop thinking critically and fail to understand basic truths.  

This problem even arises in Christian communities, where divisions between rich and poor occur.  
The rich might have their own exclusive gatherings, while the poor are left out.  
The Apostle Paul strongly criticized such behavior, showing how these distortions can harm the Church.  

Similarly, in politics, people say things like, “Oh, Americans are like this,” or “Russians are like that.”  
But reality is not so simple.  
The devil uses these distortions to lead us into error.  

Another issue is modern mythology.  
In ancient times, people believed in elves, wizards, and magical spells.  
Today, we laugh at their naivety, but we have our own myths.  
We believe in concepts like a “universal conscience” or “the world condemns something.”  
But who is this “world”? Who is condemning?  
In politics, we hear statements like, “Israel wants this,” or “Beijing decided that,” or “France retaliated.”  
These are often myths—simplified narratives that don’t reflect reality.  
Yet, people believe them without questioning.  
They read the news or listen to a trusted blogger and turn off their minds.  

The same applies to science.  
People don’t research things for themselves.  
They rely on someone who is presented as the “voice of science.”  
For example, when a figure says, “Everyone must wear masks,” people accept it as truth without critical thought.  
This is a way to break their will and impose control.  
When people lack independent thought, their minds become weak, making them susceptible to manipulation.  
This is why revolutions happen—people are swept up in ideas and follow them like a herd, rushing into actions without understanding.

We see all these market collapses and wars happening because people are pulled in one direction without using their own minds.  
They lack independent thought. Logically, they might understand that something is wrong, but their will is weak, and their minds are easily swayed.  

Let me explain a bit more about the mystery of the human soul.  
Many philosophers, theologians, and holy fathers have pondered this mystery.  
They explain that after Adam and Eve fell—when they disobeyed the Lord by refusing to fast (a simple command not to eat from one tree)—their minds and hearts were separated and distorted.  
We inherit this brokenness of human nature.  
Our hearts become attached to the wrong things—things that are temporary and worldly.  
This is why the Lord said, “Do not love the things of this world. You cannot serve both God and mammon.”  
When our hearts are attached to wealth, possessions, or worldly desires, we cannot serve the Lord.  
This is the problem of the heart.  

The problem of the mind is that it becomes enslaved to emotions, memories, and external factors.  
You can easily test this when you try to pray and find yourself distracted.  
Most people struggle with distraction during prayer.  
This shows that our minds cannot follow the intention we set for them.  
We tell ourselves, “I need to pray now; I need to talk to God.”  
But then memories intrude: “I forgot something. What happened yesterday?”  
Our attention drifts, and after a few minutes, we realize we’ve lost focus.  
External factors, like a ringing bell or noise outside, or emotions like sadness, pull us away.  
This reveals that our minds are weak—they are slaves to these distractions and detached from our hearts.  
Our hearts, meanwhile, are filled with clutter, leaving us spiritually weak and sick.  
This is the broken state of our souls, a problem that affects every one of us and humanity as a whole.  
Even local churches or groups of Christians can fall into this trap.  

Let me give a few more examples of distortions.  
One common distortion occurs when our hearts are ruled by passions like greed or envy.  
For instance, we might envy someone’s success, even if we don’t know them personally.  
They become an enemy in our minds simply because they have achieved something we haven’t.  
No harm has been done to us, yet our hearts label them as an enemy.  
This is a significant distortion because, objectively, there is no conflict.  
Our hearts, however, influence our minds, shutting off reason and creating hostility where none exists.  

Similarly, pride and anger can cause us to dehumanize others.  
For example, if we see someone who is poor and we are filled with pride and anger, we might think,  
“This person is lazy. They don’t deserve to occupy this space. They are less than human, and we can get rid of them.”  
This is a form of blindness, as it strips others of their inherent human value.  
Such distortions reveal how our passions corrupt our perception and lead us away from truth and love.  

These issues are significant and need to be addressed.  
They affect not only individuals but also communities, churches, and societies.  
Recognizing these distortions is the first step toward healing and restoring the unity of mind and heart that God intended for us.

Because we are all human, we all have weaknesses and make mistakes.  
It’s easy to imagine ourselves in someone else’s position, but we often don’t want to think about it.  
Instead, we judge others and fail to see our own failures.  
We say, “This person doesn’t deserve this,” or “They are not supposed to be here.”  
For example, there has been propaganda recently dehumanizing people in the Middle East, who are being bombed daily.  
They are labeled as animals, beasts, or terrorists, implying that they are less than human and can be killed without remorse.  
This rhetoric is deeply troubling. It echoes the horrors of the 20th century, such as the atrocities committed in Germany in the 1940s.  
But now, such dehumanization is spoken openly, which is even more alarming.  

Another distortion arises when we lack temperance and fail to practice self-restraint, such as fasting.  
If no one—like a boss or family member—restricts us, we often indulge without limits.  
This leads to the development of passions where we desire something endlessly—whether it’s wealth, comfort, experiences, or even trivial things like watching movies or eating popcorn.  
Our minds might logically understand that a certain amount is enough, but our sick hearts demand more.  
This insatiable desire is irrational and contrary to common sense.  
It’s a distortion that fuels addictions—whether to digital devices, alcohol, food, social media, or even excessive talking.  

The final distortion I want to mention is the refusal to recognize mistakes.  
When we start something and realize it’s a mistake, our pride often prevents us from admitting it.  
Instead of stopping, we continue down the same path, sinking deeper into error.  
Logic would tell us to stop, but our pride says, “I’ve already invested so much time and effort; I can’t quit now.”  
This stubbornness can lead to devastating consequences, even costing lives.  

So, what can we do about these distortions?  
The healing of the soul begins with prayer, repentance, fasting, and leading a virtuous life.  
We must exert effort to change, to follow Christ, and to serve Him.  
This requires decisively cutting off our selfishness and attachment to the world.  
Christ calls us to strengthen our weak wills and push ourselves toward spiritual growth.  
When we fail to do this, time slips away as we immerse ourselves in hobbies, movies, or other distractions.  
This is a sign that we are spiritually asleep.  

The Lord warns us to stay awake, for He will judge us in the state He finds us.  
If He finds us with our minds and hearts switched off, absorbed in useless activities, that is how we will be judged.  
Therefore, we must embrace the ascetic principle of exerting our will in everything we do.  
Whether it’s prayer, work, or relationships, we must actively engage our will to align with God’s purpose.  
This is the path to healing, transformation, and ultimately, salvation.

To overcome our passive and corrupted nature, we must actively strive to improve and align ourselves with the Lord’s will.  
One of the most powerful ways to strengthen our minds and hearts is through the practice of the **prayer of the heart**, a tradition rooted in the asceticism of the hesychasts.  
At its core, this practice involves the repetition of the **Jesus Prayer**:  
*“Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”*  

Using a prayer rope, we repeat this prayer many times—20, 30, 100, or even several hundred times—as a means of repentance and focus.  
This prayer is brief yet profound, containing both humility and repentance, which guard against pride.  
It helps us concentrate not only during prayer but also in other spiritual activities, such as participating in divine services, ministry, or studying Scripture and spiritual works.  

The Jesus Prayer gradually strengthens the mind, fortifies the will, and heals the heart, restoring the unity between mind and heart that was lost through the Fall.  
It is a transformative practice that aids in avoiding mistakes, living in spiritual wakefulness, and preparing for the Lord’s coming.  
It helps us serve Him without delusion, free from the deceptions of the world, the flesh, and the devil.  

I encourage you to learn more about the Jesus Prayer.  
In future videos, I will delve deeper into this practice, but for now, reflect deeply on its significance.  
It is a path to healing, to recovering the mind, heart, and free will, and to living in expectation of the Lord’s return.  

We must crucify and destroy the old self within us, dying to the world so that we may live for Christ and His kingdom.  
May the Lord grant you the strength, vision, and eagerness to follow this path.  
May He protect you from every failure, temptation, and delusion—whether from the world, the self, or the devil.  
May the Lord bless you and your families. Amen.
