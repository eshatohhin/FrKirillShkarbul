# Ascension of Christ Mysticism, Mission & Eschatology

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church now celebrates the Ascension of our Lord. This event holds tremendous importance because God became man so that man could ascend into heaven and achieve full union with the Holy Trinity. This occurred when the Lord ascended to heaven in His resurrected human nature. Thus, the meaning of Christmas is realized in the Ascension, just as the meaning of Pascha, the Resurrection, is also fulfilled today on this feast of the Ascension. It is by the power of the Resurrection that human nature is able to rise to heaven. This was the purpose for which the Resurrection took place. Today, we celebrate what can be seen as the culmination of Christ’s entire earthly ministry. 

This feast invites us to reflect on several important truths. First, let us consider how everything unfolded. After the Resurrection, the angels told the women, "You will meet the Lord in Galilee; He will teach you." The women then went to the apostles and disciples, sharing that the Lord had something very important to reveal and teach them, which would happen soon. Indeed, during the 40 days following His Resurrection, the Lord appeared many times to the disciples, as Saint Luke recounts. He spoke to them about the meaning of the Resurrection. The final gathering, as described by Saint Paul, included about 500 disciples on a mountain—likely the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem. After meeting the Lord in Galilee, He instructed them to return to Jerusalem and await what would happen next. He continued to guide them step by step, as they were still unable to act on their own.

This final meeting took place just outside Jerusalem, near Bethany, on the Mount of Olives. There, the Lord appeared to them, shared His final teachings, and then ascended into heaven. As He ascended, He raised His hands in blessing, signifying the divine blessing He bestowed upon them. 

The Lord revealed three crucial truths during this moment. First, He declared, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." This signifies that He now possesses the full power and kingship that were prophesied of the Messiah. The entirety of Christ’s life, ministry, and Resurrection led to this moment of Ascension, where He entered into His divine authority. This power extends not only in heaven, where the angels obey Him, but also on earth. What kind of power is this? It is the power of the Kingdom of Heaven, realized through His disciples, who become one with Him. The disciples become an extension of Christ—their hands become His hands, their mouths speak His words, and their minds align with His will. This is the reality He proclaimed: His power on earth is manifested through us, His true disciples. This is the responsibility and mission He entrusts to each of us, equipping us with everything necessary to fulfill it. Thus, He revealed this power to them and, through them, to all of us.

The second profound truth the Lord reveals is the authority He grants to His Church: the power to bind and to release. This authority is the power to forgive sins, for sin is the greatest enemy and the most profound enslavement of humanity. The Church, through this divine gift, has the power to release people from sin, to forgive, and to restore their union with God, their Creator. This extraordinary power is now entrusted by the Lord to His disciples.

The third revelation is the mission He entrusts to us. As He prepares to depart, He commands, "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you." This mission encompasses two essential aspects: first, to lead others to believe in Him and have faith, and second, to teach them to live according to that faith, as He has taught us. It is not enough to merely believe; we must also live in accordance with Christ’s teachings. These two elements are inseparable and equally vital. 

The Lord’s command to "make disciples of all nations" marks a significant expansion of the mission. While He Himself primarily taught the people of Israel, He now sends His disciples to the entire world. This is a far greater responsibility than that given to the prophets of old, who were sent only to Israel and often hesitated, citing their unworthiness or inadequacies. Yet, the disciples, entrusted with this universal mission, accept it without hesitation. This is the attitude we, too, must embrace: a willingness to boldly fulfill the mission Christ has given us.

In this final face-to-face meeting, the Lord also reassures His disciples, saying, "I am with you always, to the end of the age." He encourages them not to fear, even in the face of sorrows and persecutions, for His presence will remain with them always. This is perhaps the fourth and most comforting truth He imparts.

After He ascends and blesses them, the disciples stand gazing into the sky, reluctant to leave. At that moment, two angels appear and say, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw Him go." The angels remind them that Christ will return, and they must act swiftly to fulfill His mission. Just as He ascended in the clouds—a symbol of God’s power and presence—He will return in the same manner. For many years, the disciples returned to that mountain annually, recalling the events of the Ascension and anticipating His return. Though we may not go to the Mount of Olives, we, too, commemorate this event during the ten days leading up to Pentecost, reflecting on its profound meaning.

The Ascension breaks the barrier between heaven and earth, eliminating the separation that once existed. This mystery is beyond human comprehension. Christ, in His material body, now sits at the right hand of the Father on the throne of glory. He is present everywhere, ruling the universe, yet He is also with us and within us when we partake of Holy Communion. This paradox is mind-blowing and beyond our full understanding, yet it is the reality we embrace through faith. The Ascension reveals the boundless nature of Christ’s presence and power, uniting heaven and earth in a way that transforms our lives and our mission as His disciples.

The Ascension of our Lord elevates every true Christian to the realm of mysticism, for these are mystical realities we are called to embrace. The Lord Himself reveals these profound truths and makes them a reality in our lives. Therefore, we must not reduce our faith to mere intellectual understanding or moral actions, as if reading a book or engaging in social ministry alone suffices. Every true Christian is called to delve deeper, to ponder spiritual and higher realities. This does not mean indulging in fantasy or delusion but grounding ourselves in prayer, Holy Scripture, and the mystical tradition of the Church. 

This is why the lives of saints, such as Saint Nicholas of Serbia, and the Alexandrian tradition of mysticism are so vital. They exemplify the *anagoge*—the ascent to higher spiritual meanings. This mystical journey is essential, but it must not lead us to detachment from our mission. Like the men of Galilee who stood gazing into the sky, we must not remain fixated on the spiritual realm alone. Instead, having contemplated these profound truths, we must return to the world and carry out the work the Lord has entrusted to us. Time is short, and the Second Coming is approaching. We must act swiftly and diligently, focusing on our mission with urgency and purpose.

Our lives must strike a balance between mysticism and mission. On one hand, we are called to ascend above the worries of this world—political concerns, daily routines, and earthly distractions—and to view life from the perspective of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, we must not detach ourselves completely from the world. Instead, we return to it, carrying out our Christian ministry with renewed vigor. The world today is consumed by daily problems, but we are called to rise above them, to live as witnesses of the Kingdom of God.

The Ascension breaks the false dichotomy between the spiritual and the material. In the Old Testament and pagan philosophy, the body was often seen as a prison for the soul, and material things were deemed inherently evil. This is a heresy. Christ, in His material body, ascended into heaven, uniting the spiritual and the material. For us, these categories are no longer separate. We are not merely sinners bound to the material world while holiness exists somewhere beyond. Rather, holiness is meant to dwell within us and through us, as we share it with the world. The Kingdom of God is realized on earth through us, His Church, and we are its witnesses.

May the Lord grant us *theosis*—participation in His divine nature and mission. May our hearts be filled with joy and eagerness to serve Him daily, while also pursuing long-term spiritual projects that bear lasting fruit for His Kingdom. Let us not limit ourselves to short-term tasks but strive for enduring outcomes that glorify Him. 

May the Lord bless us all on this joyous feast of the Ascension, empowering us to live as His faithful witnesses, united in both mysticism and mission. Amen.
