# How to combat evil

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about the strategy of how to fight evil or how to withstand evil in this world.  

Last time, we talked about apostasy, and we may think that these evil powers are getting stronger, that the whole world is going in the wrong direction, and that we can’t do anything about it. We are on lockdown, perhaps; we cannot even go out, we cannot influence big things or big projects. We are not presidents, we are not part of the media, we don’t have financial power, we don’t have anything. So, we just feel a bad mood, we think we cannot do much, and we are ready to give up, as if we don’t want this life anymore.  

This is a very wrong conclusion. We need to have a completely different attitude toward this life. We need to be soldiers of Christ, no matter what happens, no matter what times we live in, no matter what surrounds us. Think of Lot—he lived in Sodom and Gomorrah, and he was the only righteous man in his family. Even his wife was attached to that world; she looked back and became a pillar of salt.  

We remember their dialogue. Abraham asked for forgiveness, for mercy for the town, so that it might not be destroyed. It was a big, huge town, with over 1,500 years of civilization in that place—very prosperous, very beautiful—but the people were corrupt, much like today. The whole society was quite corrupt. Yet, the Lord told Moses that even ten righteous men would save this place. Why? What did they do? They simply lived as righteous men, and their presence gave the place extra time for repentance.  

So, even to be a righteous person—just living your own life, not allowing sin to enter your heart, fighting against your passions—that alone is a great victory over evil.  

But today, I want to say more. Asceticism and personal spiritual life are the crucial foundation for anything else. If we don’t have this foundation, we won’t be able to do anything else; we will fail immediately. Even when we feel weak, defiled, and powerless, we must keep struggling. Have patience, pray, and trust that tomorrow the Lord will give you strength. A week from now, the Lord will give you strength. We need to know that we will regain our spiritual health if we persist in fighting evil, our passions, and our addictions. We must eradicate any kind of addiction—internet addiction, smoking, drinking, or any other vice. These things spoil us, make us weak, and render us unable to speak or act. They bring us down and take us out of the equation. The devil wants us out of the fight.  

Now, let us talk about what we can do. First, we need to remember the theory of small deeds. We may not be able to do great or big things, but even small acts can be very important in the Lord’s eyes. We don’t need to focus on influencing big trends or global events. If we think only in those terms, we will feel defeated and unable to act, because we are now dispersed, each of us on our own. Yet, even in this state of dispersion, even on my own, I can do many things.  

Many people talk a lot, but only about big projects, because they think that maybe some powerful government figures will hear them and change everything. No, we should not always be living in dreams of changing the world. Instead, we need to focus on small, tangible things.

What kind of little things?  

There is a saying that behind every great man, there is a great woman. You may never see her, but perhaps it’s his mother or his wife—someone who does everything to support him through small, seemingly minor acts. Maybe she makes him coffee or tends to other small tasks. These things may seem insignificant, but they are of great importance to him and his ability to achieve great things that everyone recognizes. We need to be ready to be that invisible person, the one who does minor things, trusting that in the end, the Lord will produce something great.  

Throughout history, even in times worse than ours, there were people who did things that went unnoticed by others. For example, Saints Cyril and Methodius were simple monks. They went into the pagan lands of Moravia and preached in small villages, doing what seemed like minor work. At the same time, bishops, patriarchs, and even the Pope of Rome were engaged in grand strategies, claiming territories and pursuing big projects that seemed to influence the world. Yet, in the end, we don’t even remember what those leaders accomplished. Instead, we remember Saints Cyril and Methodius because of the lasting impact of their work. They introduced the divine service in the local language, and their principles influenced countless people for over a thousand years. Through their efforts, Russia became Christian and Orthodox. While other preachers of their time were involved in politics and power struggles, Cyril and Methodius simply served the Lord. This is what we must do: small things for the Lord.  

In the Old Testament, we see the tribe of Dan, one of the twelve sons of Jacob. When Dan received his blessing, it was not for conquering great lands or achieving fame. Instead, his blessing was to care for those who were behind, the weak or the sick—those who were struggling at the back. He helped them, and though it was not a major, visible achievement, it was significant in the eyes of the Lord.  

Similarly, many people today don’t want to care for those who are different or require extra effort, such as special needs students. But the spirit of Dan teaches us to care for them, even if it takes a hundred times more energy, time, and patience to teach them simple things, like how to use a spoon to eat. They may never become champions, scientists, or leaders, but the act of helping them achieve something as basic as eating with a spoon is more important in the Lord’s eyes than preparing them for grand achievements. It’s about the heart, about doing what is right, even if it goes unnoticed by the world.  

We must understand the spirit of the times—doing things that may not be recognized or celebrated but are important to the Lord. In the spiritual war we are engaged in—and I speak of war not in the sense of physical aggression but as a battle of light against darkness—our weapons are the Word of God, love, and the message of the Gospel. We love even those who consider us enemies. We love sinners. Our position is different; it’s not a physical war but a spiritual one, where light shines in the darkness. Our task is to find ways to let that light shine, even through the smallest acts of faithfulness and love.

But in war, there are different situations. There are positional wars, where two armies are not making significant advances but are instead exchanging artillery fire. Today, we see that evil is pushing forward, trying to advance. In many ways, it has already conquered certain areas—moral values, society, young people, family values, and more. Our society, perhaps not our own personal lives, but society as a whole, has already been overrun in these areas. We are also "hacked" in many ways, spiritually and morally.  

In those areas where we are still trying to hold our ground, we need to strengthen our position. Our own spirituality, our families, and our close relationships are the things we can influence. We need to help our friends and those who trust us to become stronger, to hold onto solid values, and to cultivate a sound spiritual life. This will matter greatly in this positional war. The devil doesn’t want to advance too quickly, because if he does, he risks being thrown back. Instead, he pushes slowly, step by step, wearing us down over time.  

We need to be aware of this strategy. The devil works not only through the media or large-scale influences but also on an individual level. Through platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and other sources of distraction and corruption, he seeks to spoil people one by one. We must hold our position firmly, resisting these attacks on our hearts and minds.  

In the areas where we are already conquered, we need to act like guerrillas or partisans—those who operate in the shadows, striking the enemy when the opportunity arises. How do we do this? With the Word of God. I will offer some practical advice on how we can engage in this spiritual resistance.  

One crucial thing we must remember is that the Lord is almighty. He is the Lord of strength. As we pray, "Holy God, holy mighty, holy immortal, have mercy on us," we acknowledge His might. This aspect of God’s power is also reflected in Isaiah 11:2, where we read about the seven spirits of God. We ask for the Spirit of God to give us His gifts, and one of these gifts is the Spirit of might, of strength.  

In the Psalms, the prophet David declares that those who rely on the Lord will be like Mount Zion—unshakable, immovable. We have that power within us, not by our own strength, but through the Spirit of God. When we rely on Him, we stand firm, no matter how fiercely the enemy attacks.  

So, in this spiritual war, let us hold our ground where we can, strengthen our positions, and strike back where necessary, always relying on the might and power of the Lord. He is our fortress, our strength, and our victory.

The Lord says, "Build your house on a rock"—the rock of faith. That rock is Christ Himself, and His might is something we can rely on. We need to live in such a way that we draw strength from the might of the Lord, and this will help us in any kind of spiritual warfare as we withstand evil. This is crucial to remember: it is not the devil who has the might; it is we who can gain this might through Christ. We are called to become like Mount Zion—unshakable and steadfast.  

Now, let’s talk about projects. What kind of projects can we undertake? Of course, everyone has their own talents and experiences. First, we don’t need to think about inventing entirely new things. Instead, let’s look around and consider what we’ve already started or have experience in. Maybe we have connections or resources we can use. Ask yourself, "What can I do for the Lord?"  

Think of it this way: when I was young, I was strong, fast, and energetic. But now, perhaps I’ve grown older, weaker, or less active. Spiritually, the same can happen. At one point, we may have been in better spiritual shape and started something meaningful, but over time, spiritual "viruses"—like laziness, distraction, or sin—have weakened us. Now, we need to regain our spiritual shape and return to those projects. The Lord may bless us this time, and we may succeed where we once struggled.  

First, let’s think about what kind of projects we can take on. Every day, we need to make some progress—not just sit idly. In our spiritual lives, we should take daily steps toward our goals in this spiritual warfare and in our external ministry.  

For Orthodox Christians, one way to help is by getting more involved in the church. Ask your priest what initiatives are happening. He may have advice or tasks for you. Join a group or team, even if it’s something you’re unfamiliar with or don’t find immediately interesting. Be willing to try new things. In a team, with the blessing of the church and the support of others, you’ll achieve better results.  

Another way to serve is through social initiatives. We need to overcome the spirit of selfishness—the mindset of "my time, my safety, my comfort." Instead, step out and volunteer. Visit elderly homes, orphanages, or other places where people need help. Join others who are already doing this work. It’s a powerful way to serve and grow spiritually.  

Self-education is also important. Study and learn, not for personal gain or to add to your resume, but for the Lord. Equip yourself with knowledge and skills so you can share them with others. This is a great motivation—it keeps you focused and organized.  

Consider media projects as well. Share your faith on platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or forums. Post content about Christianity, faith, and positive, healthy living. If you have talents in this area, use them with a missionary focus.  

Publishing projects are another option. While people may not read as much these days, they still do. Create bulletins, books, or small brochures that share the faith and inspire others.  

Organizing activities is also valuable. Plan pilgrimages, picnics, or celebrations of feast days with fellow Orthodox Christians. Host lectures or other events. We need more activities that bring people together in faith and fellowship.  

In all these projects, the key is to take action. Start small, but start. The Lord will bless your efforts, and through them, you will grow stronger in your spiritual life and contribute to the fight against evil. Remember, it’s not about doing grand things but about being faithful in the little things. As we build our lives on the rock of Christ, we become unshakable, and our small acts of faithfulness can have a profound impact in the world.

And of course, helping those in need—orphans, the vulnerable, and those who are suffering—is a powerful way to live out our faith. The spirit of service I mentioned earlier is something you can embrace in your own life. Let us think about these things and strive to be more active.  

Our small, seemingly insignificant projects can disrupt the devil’s plans. The devil may be working on big projects and trends, but we don’t need to be consumed by them. Yes, we should be aware of what’s happening in the world, but our focus should remain on our own little projects, moving forward step by step. This is our spirit—we are spiritually autonomous. The devil has no control over us, and we continue to press on, doing our small acts of faithfulness.  

These small projects are incredibly important to the Lord. May the Lord help us, giving us the strength, health, faith, and eagerness to work for His glory. In His name, may the Lord bless each of you and guide you in your efforts. Amen.
