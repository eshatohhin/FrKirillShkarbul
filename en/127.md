# Three levels of “Conspiracy”

Dear brothers and sisters, after Holy Christmas, we enter a very special time. Before the Epiphany is the time of Christmas blessing. We feel that the Lord has just come into this world. He brought salvation, new hope, and new opportunities for us. He is renewing the whole world, and as we enter the new year, we also have a sense of something new. This feeling of renewal will deepen with the baptism of Christ, the Epiphany, which will be on January 19th. We feel that this renewal is also taking place within us. 

As we experience this renewal, it is good to reflect on how we view the world. There are three basic attitudes that people generally hold. First, there is the optimistic view that the world is developing, humanity is becoming wiser and more educated, we have better technologies, and we are discovering new things. Second, there is the pessimistic view that things are getting worse, morals are deteriorating, people are turning away from the church and from God, and everything seems to be going downhill. People become more jealous, serve mammon, and many other negative trends emerge. Third, there is what we might call the Hindu or Buddhist view, which sees everything as constantly changing but fundamentally the same. People’s sins remain the same, and the way the world operates doesn’t really change. These are the three basic attitudes people hold.

As gay Christians, when we think about these things, we must first remember that there is a spiritual war taking place, and we are participants in this war. In every war, there are times when we are winning and times when we are losing, or when the army is losing even though we are trying to win. We need to assess this first on an individual level. Am I fighting well? Am I doing what the Lord expects of me? Am I well-trained and in good shape for this battle? This is the most important thing—far more important than what is happening in the world at large. However, while focusing on our personal spiritual condition, we should not neglect to consider the bigger picture, the global situation. 

The Bible teaches us to think about these things because it speaks of the beginning of the world, the end of the world, and the unfolding of God’s plan over the centuries. We relive this during every liturgy, and so the big picture is also important to us—not just our own salvation or spiritual state. We need to consider where the world is heading, its current state, who the main players are, and what is happening globally. It is good to think about these things, but we must not become obsessed or develop phobias about them. Above all, we must not forget that our own internal world is where the seed of God’s Word is growing, and that is far more important.

When we think about this big picture, there is something I want to discuss today. We are familiar with the concept of the "invisible hand of the market" from economics. This idea suggests that no government or company plans everything; instead, the market operates on its own. I don’t need to go into great detail about this. There is also an invisible hand at work in other areas, such as globalization. The world is changing around us due to lower tariffs, increased trade, technological advancements, and other factors. This process is somewhat chaotic and not controlled by any single entity. We don’t see who is directing these changes. For example, we observe certain trends in social life...

The new generation is different from the previous one. The way people think and behave has changed in some ways. Of course, in some respects, all humans are the same, but in other ways, they are different. We cannot simply explain these differences by pointing to specific factors. There is an invisible hand at work behind these changes. How is this happening? You might ask, "What does this have to do with me? I’m not a sociologist or an economist." The truth is, there is a very direct connection. The Lord wants us to understand what is happening in the world. 

Among the seven spirits that the prophet Isaiah received—the seven spirits of God—there is the spirit of knowledge. This spirit is distinct from the spirit of wisdom and the other spirits. Today, I want to speak a little about this. The spirit of knowledge gives us understanding and insight into the nature of things and the processes unfolding in the world. We should not remain ignorant, saying, "It’s not my responsibility; I only need to focus on my little world." The Lord wants us to be informed. This knowledge may be necessary to help others, and we can be taught directly by Him. While we should educate ourselves, even in secular sciences, we can gain even deeper understanding through divine revelation. This revelation is not limited to purely spiritual matters but extends to things related to this world.

Our faith is deeply intertwined with the world. The Old Testament and much of the New Testament are rooted in history—real people, real events. Our faith is not just about abstract ideas or concepts; it is an incarnated religion, fully connected to this world, its history, and individual lives. Therefore, it is good for us to understand what is happening around us. Unfortunately, most people, even Christians, do not think deeply about these things. They simply live day by day, doing their jobs and surviving. They might ask, "Why should I bother to think about these things?" Hopefully, we can rise above this mindset. Even non-Christians, especially the educated and intelligent ones, understand some of the forces at work behind the scenes. As Christians, we should strive to know even more than they do.

How can we gain this knowledge? At the very least, we need to recognize that there are plans and forces at work—these "invisible hands." Some of these forces remain invisible to us because we lack the understanding of the principles behind them. For example, in economics, many people have not studied the subject. If they had, they would understand more and not simply say, "It’s just invisible; it just happens." Similarly, there are influential individuals and groups who develop plans without revealing them to the public. Corporations, for instance, often keep many things secret to achieve their goals and make money. 

As Christians, we must seek to understand these dynamics, not out of fear or obsession, but so that we can navigate the world wisely and fulfill our calling. The spirit of knowledge equips us to see beyond the surface and discern the deeper workings of the world, all while keeping our focus on the growth of God’s Word within us.

They analyze their customers—they analyze you, how you behave, and how you might react to a product they plan to release or some other initiative. They know a great deal, though not everything, and they act on this knowledge. Meanwhile, you are often passive, simply receiving what they have created and reacting in predictable ways. This is not limited to corporations; there are also individuals and groups with significant influence over the world and its direction. 

Today, I don’t want to delve into whether there is one grand master plan orchestrated by a single group or if there are simply multiple powerful entities pursuing their own agendas. Often, many changes in the world go unreported in the news, yet these changes are not random. They happen because people have planned and executed them. This isn’t necessarily a conspiracy in the negative sense—any plan kept secret from others can be called a conspiracy. There’s nothing inherently wrong with being a "conspirologist" if your goal is simply to understand the plans of those in power. 

However, there are at least two other levels of planning we must consider. The first is the plan of God. God has a master plan because He is one, and His plan is unified—one beginning, one world, one end. This plan is beyond human comprehension; it is a mystery. The second is the plan of the devil. The devil is also one being, with his own goals. As a spiritual entity, he knows much about humanity and can use people as instruments to further his agenda. For example, when we see widespread obsession with mammon—riches, comfort, consumption, and selfishness—we might wonder if this is the result of a group of people conspiring. Perhaps, but ultimately, the devil is behind it, exploiting human sins and passions to push his plan forward. Even if the powerful individuals or groups in the world are not fully aligned, there is one being—the devil—who is unified in his purpose and works against God’s plan.

At times, it may seem as though darkness is overwhelming everything, as if evil is prevailing. But we must remember that God’s plan is ultimately sovereign. While the devil may appear to gain ground, his efforts are temporary and limited. As Christians, we are called to discern these spiritual realities, to resist the devil’s schemes, and to align ourselves with God’s plan. This requires vigilance, prayer, and a deep understanding of both the spiritual and worldly forces at work. By doing so, we can navigate the complexities of this world with wisdom and faith, trusting in the ultimate victory of God’s plan over all darkness.

But this is not the case. God’s plan is far greater and wiser, and He outmaneuvers the devil at every turn. This is why we must always remember this truth. The holy people remind us that the world had one beginning, and it will have one end. The beginning was good because it came from God, and so the end must also be good, for it too comes from God. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. We do not believe in a God who fails. Even though our limited human perspective—our "chicken brain," as it were—might lead us to think that things are falling apart and everything is being destroyed, this is not the truth. We must remember that God’s plan is above the devil’s plan, and it will prevail.

A powerful example of this is what happened with Jesus Christ. There were people who conspired against Him: Judas, the betrayer; the chief priests and scribes, who plotted to kill Him; and Pontius Pilate, who, driven by his own desire for power, allowed Christ’s crucifixion to preserve his position. These individuals had different motives and agendas, but they were all united by the devil to accomplish his will. The devil’s plan was to kill Christ, to silence His teachings, and to prevent Him from fulfilling His mission. The devil wanted to humiliate Christ, to make people doubt God’s power, and to create the illusion of his own dominance. But God used this evil plan for a higher purpose: to trample death by death and to bring salvation through Christ’s resurrection. This does not mean God approved of the actions of Judas, the chief priests, or Pilate. Jesus Himself said that it would have been better for them never to have been born. Yet, God allowed these events to unfold and used them to overthrow the devil’s plans.

We can see these three levels at work in this story, and they are still at work in our world today. In our time, we face various crises—medical, economic, political—and many other challenges. These events also operate on three levels. The first level is what we see in the news and statistics—the surface-level information that everyone knows. The second level is often hidden, a deeper reality that most people do not see. Sometimes, what is presented to us is a manipulated picture, designed to shape our perceptions. Unfortunately, most people remain on this surface level, unaware of the deeper forces at work. 

As Christians, we must strive to be wise, to look beyond what is immediately visible, and to understand the spiritual battle being waged. We must remain positive about the future, knowing that God’s plan will ultimately triumph. At the same time, we must actively engage in the spiritual battle we face personally. Every day, we must fight against the enemy and overcome the temptations and challenges that come our way. May the Lord strengthen our faith, grant us wisdom, and guide us as we wage this battle. May He overthrow all enemies who rise against us, against Him, and against His plan. God bless you, and Merry Christmas.
