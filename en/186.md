# Various types of spiritual fruits, and how to unlock our potential

Dear brothers and sisters, the Lord told His disciples that if they do not bear fruit, they will be cut off and cast into the fire.  
In Revelation, we also see that the Lord is telling the churches to stand firm in faith. If they endure to the end, they will receive the crown from the Lord—the crown of victory.  
What we see now is that there is not much fruit being borne, and over the centuries, this seems to have worsened.  
How do I know this? We can judge from the mission work we do. This is just one aspect. For example, in many countries I visit—in Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia, or Asia in general—there is a lack of mission efforts.  
It is obvious that more could be done. It is not impossible. Yet, for centuries, either no one has gone there, no one wants to go, or someone began the work but did not finish, leaving it abandoned.  
There are all kinds of situations. In other places, we find churches where 15-20 priests are assigned to one place, yet their role is limited to saying a single phrase during the entire service.  
That’s it. Everything is stable, everything is fine, and they receive their paycheck. Why bother doing more?  
This is just one example, a small illustration. We can see this everywhere—not only in mission work but also in ascetic life. There are not many great ascetics today.  
Even in regular parish life, the efforts in spiritual growth, studying the Gospel, and participating in church life are minimal and limited.  
Even in educating their own children, many people are unwilling to put in the effort to raise them in faith.  
So the question arises: Why does this happen? What can we do about it? And what mistakes are being made?  

First, let me clarify what kind of fruits we are talking about. There are different types of fruits, which are interrelated but distinct.  
There are three main types. The first is ministry to the Lord through self-sacrifice.  
This ministry can take many forms. For example, our dedication and service within our families.  
If we are Christians, we sacrifice ourselves in this ministry—raising children, caring for our spouses, and fulfilling all family responsibilities as an offering to the Lord.  
This is not driven by a sense of obligation, emotional sentiment, or societal expectations.  
It must come from the heart—a Christian heart filled with love for Christ.  
Our labor, whatever we do, becomes ministry to the Lord when done in a Christian spirit.  
This is the most common form of ministry. Many people are focused on this, or are supposed to be, but often do it half-heartedly.  
I am speaking of Christians here.  

There are other types of ministry as well. Pastoral or teaching ministry involves educating others, helping them gain knowledge or salvation through the Lord.  
There is also the ministry of students studying or researchers conducting research.  
Other forms include writing books, composing music, or creating art—not for personal glory, but as a ministry to the Lord, done in a spirit of self-sacrifice.  
Serving in parish life is another form of ministry—spending time chanting, assisting with parish needs, or engaging in social work within the church.  
Even caring for our health can become ministry if done with the intention of better serving the Lord—not for ourselves, but so that we may be healthier, our minds sharper, and our service more effective.  
Even our rest, when done in moderation, can be part of this ministry. You might ask, “When do I rest?” Yes, we need rest, but it should be balanced and purposeful.

*Antum quantum*, as the Romans used to say in Latin—just as much as needed, not more, not less. And even this must be done to glorify the Lord.  
As the Apostle Paul tells us, "Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God."  
This is the most common and general form of ministry—ministry to the Lord. But there are two other types of ministry that are more specific yet equally necessary for every Christian.  
The first is mission work—testifying about our faith. The second is asceticism—spiritual life, prayer, fasting, reading the writings of holy people, and, above all, reading the Gospel.  
These are essential. Without them, our other ministries will be impossible.  

Now, the question is: Why don’t we bear these fruits? The answer is quite straightforward. The primary issue is that we fall prey to the devil’s deceit, seduction, and various hindrances.  
What does the devil want? He wants one of two things: either for us to become great sinners, serving him and Mammon, in which case he grants us the power to achieve worldly success, or, if we resist that path, to trap us in addiction to sin, making us incapable of breaking free.  
He uses these addictions to "hack" us, rendering us ineffective in serving the Lord.  
If we resist being seduced or hooked, he then seeks to suppress our will—through bad moods, depression, fear, spiritual and physical imbalance.  
He aims to make us nervous, pessimistic, or broken in spirit, thereby weakening our resolve.  

This hacking of humanity is happening gradually. If the devil acted too quickly, people might turn back, but he seeks a stable, irreversible outcome.  
For example, the entire Western Church was once Orthodox, but over centuries, the devil planted a virus in the minds of people—both leaders and laypeople—slowly pulling them away until they split into heresy.  
Now, he is doing this on a global scale, pushing subtly day by day.  
We often focus on the future, wondering how crises will resolve or how new technologies might improve our lives.  
We watch the news, waiting for something to happen, but we fail to notice that the devil is working daily, causing us to drift further from God.  

To reverse this, we must unlock the immense spiritual potential within us.  
We see this potential in the lives of the saints—their eagerness, their boldness, and their willingness to undertake extraordinary acts for the Lord.  
Whether through mission work, asceticism, or other forms of service, they were champions of faith. We must learn from their example.  

As an analogy, consider the development of capitalism from the 16th and 17th centuries onward. This period saw a massive expansion of technology and industry, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, which transformed the world.  
Today, if you look out the window, the landscape is entirely different from what it was 300 years ago.  
Yet, for thousands of years before that, life remained largely unchanged—people lived in small houses, rode horses, and experienced little technological progress.  
This analogy, though imperfect, illustrates how significant change can occur over time, both for good and for ill.  

In the same way, we must recognize the gradual but profound spiritual shifts happening around us and respond with urgency, unlocking our potential to serve the Lord faithfully and bear fruit for His glory.

And they thought, "Well, that’s life. That’s how it is. We can’t do much." But suddenly, so much change happened.  
Capitalism found a kind of key to unlock potential—not that people before couldn’t have done it, but they didn’t. They thought they were incapable. Yet, at some point, this key was discovered, leading to an explosion of progress and expansion.  
I’m not saying whether this is good or bad—that’s another discussion—but in a similar way, we need to find the key that unlocks the potential of our souls.  
Of course, this can only happen with the Lord’s help and blessing. We can make these profound changes in our spiritual lives and in the ministries we undertake, bearing the fruit that Christ is waiting for.  

So, how do we do it? Capitalism, driven by Mammon, unlocked material progress. The desire for comfort, prosperity, enjoyment, and consumption fueled this expansion.  
While not all of it was bad—scientists sought truth, and talent played a role—Mammon was a significant driving force.  
The driving force behind our spiritual transformation must be entirely different. Unfortunately, some so-called Christian churches operate under delusion.  
They become fanatical about certain ideas, but their actions lack the spirit of repentance and humility. This is not healthy, nor does it come from Christ.  
We must avoid slipping into such errors.  

The key to bearing fruit is deep repentance.  
We see this in the lives of the saints who went to the ends of the earth to preach the Gospel. Many of them experienced a profound turning away from sin.  
To prove their love for the Lord and their gratitude for His gift of salvation, they sought to bring as many people as possible to faith and salvation.  
This zeal and eagerness to preach and do mission work stemmed from their repentance.  

The same is true for ascetics like Saint Mary of Egypt. Before her conversion, she was a great sinner.  
But after her repentance, she embraced extreme asceticism as a way to prove her gratitude for the Lord’s forgiveness.  
She served the Lord with even greater zeal than she had once served the devil.  
For most ascetics, repentance is the key factor behind their eagerness and dedication.  

Our repentance, however, is often shallow. We might think, "Oh, maybe a month ago I said something unkind," but this is not true repentance.  
True repentance is recognizing that we are living in a state of spiritual death, betraying the Lord, and enslaved to our passions.  
It is a deep, heartfelt sorrow for our sins and a desire to change.  
Only then can the Lord heal our souls and enable us to bear fruit.  

In the parable of the sower, only one type of soil bore fruit—the good soil.  
The seeds that fell by the road, on rocky ground, or among thorns did not bear fruit because the people did not value the word of God.  
They did not make it a priority in their lives. When temptation came, they withered away.  

To bear fruit, we must value the gift of salvation and make it the central focus of our lives.  
We must cultivate deep repentance, humility, and a burning desire to serve the Lord.  
Only then can we unlock the spiritual potential within us and bring forth the fruit that glorifies God.

So, this is so important: we must prepare our hearts and souls to be good, deep, and nurtured soil—free from thorns, weeds, and distractions—so that they can bear fruit manifold.  
Mission work and asceticism should be part of every Christian’s life. Even if these are not the primary focus of our ministry, without them, we cannot effectively serve in any other capacity.  

Let us work toward this goal—unlocking the spiritual potential within us by the Lord’s grace and help—so that we may bear much more fruit than we do now.  
The Lord will guide us in how and what kind of fruit we should bring.  

May the Lord help us in this time of weak faith, when examples of zeal and eagerness in mission work and asceticism are scarce.  
This scarcity places a great responsibility on us. If there are not many people striving for holiness, that is no excuse for us to conform.  
The Lord is watching to see if we can set a different trend and bear fruit, even as darkness seems to prevail and many are overcome by depression, sin, or other distractions.  

May the Lord grant us His grace, revelation, and wisdom, and guide us to walk in the footsteps of the apostles and all the saints who pleased Him.  
God bless.
