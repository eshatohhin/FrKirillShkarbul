# How to follow Christ in times of political turmoil

Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Church has entered into Passion Week. We have entered together with Christ into Jerusalem. We just celebrated Palm Sunday with palms and branches. We were greeting the King of the Universe as He entered this Holy City of God, the city of Jerusalem, to reveal and accomplish His mission. His mission was the mission of the Messiah, taking upon Himself the sins of the whole world and rescuing us from the bondage of death and slavery. This was done in a very strange way because He did not possess power, He did not take influence or a throne, and He did not call people to form a political party. Instead, He was surrendered, betrayed, beaten, humiliated, crucified, and He died. Then He rose, He resurrected on the third day, conquering death and sin. 

When we recall these events, we also remember that on the same day the Lord entered Jerusalem, Pontius Pilate, the governor of that region of Palestine, came from Caesarea, which was the capital at that time. He also came to Jerusalem. Perhaps he came to address the issue of the revolt led by Barabbas, who had killed someone and was imprisoned. Maybe he came because of the approaching Pesach, the Jewish feast of Pascha. We do not know exactly why he came, but he also entered Jerusalem, possibly through different gates. 

This makes us reflect on how we relate to political issues and power. The world is currently in turmoil. We know that with the so-called "Great Reset," it is said that for about five years, perhaps more, the world will be shaken by all kinds of political turmoil, revolts, rallies, and revolutions. We saw this begin last year in the United States, and there will be much more due to social tensions that are spilling over, among other factors. As soon as the quarantine and regulations are lifted, people will begin to act in all kinds of unpredictable ways. This requires us to think deeply about whom we support, whom we criticize, and which side we take. 

We need to reflect deeply on this because we will discover that if we identify ourselves as socialists, capitalists, democrats, republicans, or members of any particular party, we have not yet fully understood the meaning of the Christian faith. For a Christian, God and Christ come first. A Christian takes everything that comes from Christ as absolute truth, while recognizing that everything that happens in this world is relative. Satan uses politics to divide people in order to conquer the world. If we divide ourselves by saying, "I am a democrat," or "I am a republican," or whatever, we are essentially being used by Satan in his schemes. 

However, this does not mean that we should not care about politics. Some people say, "I don't care about politics at all," but this is not the Christian way. Today, we will discuss this topic. About a month ago, I made a video on this subject, and I recommend you watch it if you haven't already. Today, we will approach it from a different angle.

First of all, we see that every political turmoil that occurs brings some people to prison, some to death, breaks families apart, and causes a great deal of suffering. This is what happens when we enter into the game of politics. We need to understand that this is a game with its own rules, and if we choose to participate, we must play by those rules. For example, if you support a particular party, and that party comes to power, it will have to deal with its political opponents. It may exile some, imprison others, or even resort to killing as a form of punishment. Even if it does not carry out such actions, it must be prepared to do so in its heart. The decision to act violently, if necessary, is already present. 

Moreover, to attain power, violence and bloodshed are often required. If you choose to play this game, you must be ready to see it through to the end, and you will inevitably engage in these actions. This is a 100% cynical game. You must adopt a different logic—one where your political opponent is your enemy, and you use every means available to destroy them, politically or even physically. There is no room for love or the commandment Jesus gave us to love our enemies. It is akin to being in a yard where everyone is kicking each other, and the last one standing wins everything. If you are thrown into that yard, you either kick others or get kicked yourself. There is no middle ground. You cannot appeal to higher values or moral principles. It is a brutal game, even if it is disguised with polite words and appearances. 

If we truly seek political influence, this is the game we must play. However, this does not mean we should not participate at all. Our participation must be different. 

Another important point is that no political system or ideology—whether capitalism, communism, socialism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, or any other -ism—holds absolute truth. These are all tools of the devil, designed to pit people against one another. Some may believe one system is more true, while others believe in another, and they fight endlessly. In the end, Satan wins and rules the world. We must not mistake any of these systems for absolute truth. They are all relative. We need to understand them, but we must also recognize that none of them embody absolute truth. 

For example, we may support democracy, but we see it can become authoritarian. Conversely, we may support authoritarianism, only to find it used to promote anti-Christian agendas, such as LGBT rights. The devil is clever and can use any system to his advantage. No matter what we support, we risk losing if we become too attached to any ideology. This is why I say that if you identify yourself with any -ism, you have not yet fully grasped the essence of the Christian faith. 

We must maintain a distance from these ideologies while still understanding them. The goal is not to be used by them but to use them wisely. I will elaborate on this shortly. 

As Christians, our primary task is to grow spiritually and deepen our spiritual lives. This is what sets us apart and enables us to make a difference. By doing so, we detach ourselves from the seduction of political ideologies. When a political event occurs, we must not rush to support or oppose it impulsively. Instead, we must approach it with discernment, rooted in our faith and spiritual maturity. 

In summary, while we cannot ignore politics entirely, our engagement must be guided by our faith and spiritual growth, not by the divisive and destructive rules of the political game.

And we will make mistakes and fall into the devil's trap. However, with spiritual wisdom, we will not become overly attached to worldly things—such as social programs, agendas, or policies that are often debated. We will not be as entangled in these matters because our worldview is fundamentally different from theirs. This detachment is a fruit of a deep spiritual life, where we truly follow Christ. 

Another thing we can do is to observe and understand what is happening in the world. We need to grow in awareness of the various ideologies, the people behind them, and their agendas. However, our perspective on these matters must differ from that of the world. We must see them through the lens of faith, not through the lens of political or social ambition. 

Thirdly, we must not fall into the trap of thinking, "I need to do something, I need to act." In terms of politics, we should trust that Christ can use us when and if He needs us. There have been saints whom God used to bring about significant political changes, even leading entire empires to Christianity. However, it is not our role to pursue such outcomes aggressively. The Lord knows how and when to use us. If He does not call us to such tasks, our conscience remains clear because our primary goal is to seek His kingdom in our hearts and to be His witnesses, not advocates of any ideology. 

Lastly, and most importantly, as we have been chosen by Him and have stepped onto the path of being Orthodox Christians, our lives become exceedingly precious in His eyes. We cannot waste our lives on things that are unimportant or relative, such as political agendas. If we rally for a cause and end up imprisoned, our time and freedom are taken away, and we lose the opportunity to testify for Christ. If we are killed in a rally, our lives are lost for something temporal, not eternal. The Lord will not necessarily protect us in such cases because we have chosen to prioritize something other than Him. 

We must not waste our lives, time, or freedom on political agendas. Yes, we should be ready to die for our friends if their lives are in danger. Yes, we should be ready to die for Christ and for bearing witness to Him. But we should not be ready to die for a political cause. This is a crucial distinction. 

Therefore, let us ask the Lord to grant us wisdom and knowledge on how to act and what to do. We must remember that witnessing about Him is the most important goal in our lives. Nothing else compares in significance. May the Lord bless each of you and grant you wisdom and discernment. Amen.
