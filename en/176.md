# Mobilization in Russia war against evil or self destruction

Dear brothers and sisters, this world is slipping into chaos.  
Just a few days ago, we heard about partial mobilization in Russia, which means that the war between Ukraine and Russia is going to get worse. There is an even greater risk that other countries will become more involved, and there is a threat of nuclear war.  
So, where is this going?  
What do we choose in terms of whom we support?  
These are questions we ask ourselves, and we ask the Lord to help us make decisions.  
As Christians, we should not rely solely on the news or the opinions of analysts who tell us, "Okay, this is the truth."  
We need to ask the Lord to give us answers and to help us find our own role in all this chaos that is going on.  

Today, I want to share with you my own understanding of what is happening and what we should do.  
What should Orthodox Christians do in this situation? How should we face it?  
What is going on in Ukraine and Russia?  
This is the biggest question, and I have been in this conflict, in Donbas, quite a few times. I know more than many people.  
So today, I will say some things that many people may not like, but I have to say them because this is the truth as I see it. There is no more time for political correctness or using vague phrases. We need to speak the truth because we are witnesses of Jesus Christ, and He is the truth.  

For a few days after this happened, I was depressed, similar to when this war began in February. I couldn’t say much, and I was trying to figure out what the right words to say were and what is actually going on.  
Now, after a few days, I can share with you my feelings, my opinion about what is happening, and I will also try to answer the question of whether people should be mobilized, whether they should go to war or not. This concerns people who are members of the Church—Ukrainians, Russians—and the Russian Church covers both Ukraine and Russia, and not only in those countries but also around the world. In fact, many other faithful of all nationalities are affected, even here in Taiwan, where we have Taiwanese, Americans, Filipinos, and many other nations.  

Now, there is this big question: Should we support one of the sides, or should we not? What should we say to those who ask us? By answering this question, I hope that you can also gain a deeper understanding of what is going on, especially the spiritual reasons behind it, and what the true reason, the true goal of this war is.  

First of all, I want to bring up the parable of the cancer.

When there is a cancer cell in the organism—I’m not a doctor or medical scientist, so I’ll explain in simple terms—the healthy cells will try to fight it, and this struggle creates a tumor. Eventually, because of this growing tumor, the person will die. Paradoxically, it is the reaction of the healthy cells that leads to the death of the organism. This is what happens.  

Something similar is now being orchestrated by the devil in Russia—in "big Russia," as I understand it, which includes Ukraine and Belarus. Let me explain this further. I myself am partly Ukrainian and partly Russian, though I believe this is not so relevant because, in Christ, our primary identity is Christian. However, I can understand the dynamics because this is one family in terms of nationality. I know Ukrainians, I know Russians. If you are neither Ukrainian nor Russian, this is not your war. Try to distance yourself from it, avoiding taking sides. Even if you are Russian or Ukrainian, you should strive to understand what is truly happening.  

As a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, it is our responsibility to understand what is happening and to guide people on what to do from a Christian standpoint. In my view, the healthy understanding is that there is the concept of *Rus*. What is *Rus*? *Rus* was formed from many different tribes and small kingdoms, all of which were united under the idea of the Kingdom of Heaven and the Orthodox faith. We are one Christian nation, with the goal of the Kingdom of Heaven as our ultimate aim—not just for a single nation, as we understand it today, but for an entire civilization. This is what we call *Holy Rus*.  

This goal, this grand project, was carried out under the guidance of the Lord, and many saints emerged within it. Although the reality never reached the point where most people became Christians or saints, this was the overall direction. Until now, those who remain faithful to this project are, in my opinion, the "healthy cells." These people—both in Ukraine and in Russia—who desire to unite Russia and Ukraine under one project, one direction rooted in the Orthodox faith, are the healthy cells. They are a tiny minority, but they are crucial.  

The Antichrist, or rather the spirit of the Antichrist—perhaps not the final Antichrist, but the spirit that has always existed, as the Holy Fathers tell us—has made his move. This spirit uses reality as its starting point. It has its own "truth." For example, the Marxists used economic and social realities to bring about revolutions. The liberals used their own version of truth to support the collapse of the Soviet Union during Perestroika. Every major change in the world, from the French Revolution onward, has used some objective reality to divide people into opposing camps, each with a fragment of the truth.  

Now, we see this division in the Ukrainian truth and the Russian truth. Both sides have some truth, as does the collective West, which supports Ukraine in this war. The truth on the Ukrainian side—not the West, but the Ukrainians themselves, including those Russians who identify as Ukrainians—has its own validity.

Because I am convinced that it is one nation that was divided—not ethnically, but as one civilization, one people. This division has now led to a situation where part of this Russian people, the Ukrainians, have been convinced—most of them—that they are the true Russians, and that they will have a free, autonomous, sovereign country. They see Russia as totalitarian, Bolshevik, and fascist. They reject Putin and everything associated with him. The biggest mistake here is that they no longer consider the Russians in Russia to be their brothers; they see them as enemies. This mindset is the cancer cell. This idea, this rhetoric, is in itself a fascist ideology.  

This is what has happened to the mentality there. And of course, even if Ukraine wins this war, it will not become an autonomous country. Where do you see an autonomous country in today’s world? Everything is merging into the postmodern, post-Christian, globalist agenda. It is all part of what we call *Leviathan*. We can see this in the propaganda and events that have unfolded in Ukraine since 2014, especially as it increasingly aligns with the globalist, anti-Christian agenda.  

On the other hand, we have Russia, which also has many of these issues but is still trying to oppose some of the post-Christian, modernist agenda. People there are called to fight against the enemy, which is portrayed as invading. In the last speech, it was declared that they would fight to the death to prevent the West—this post-Christian, evil West—from conquering them. They are willing to fight to the last Russian.  

This rhetoric appeals to the holy ideals implanted in the minds of many Russians, especially those who care not about their own lives or prosperity but are willing to die for ideals, for their country, for God, and for the Orthodox Church. These are the healthy cells. But now, these healthy cells are being called to go and die, and in doing so, they may destroy Russia for good—just as the healthy cells in an organism can lead to its death.  

At this point, it may be too late for these healthy cells to fight in a way that will cure the whole organism. The Antichrist has brought everything to this stage by depriving people of faith.  

Recently, I was reading a book by Eugenia Diakova, a Russian immigrant in Paris, who witnessed the horrors of the Soviet Union in the 1920s. Those years, the 1920s and 1930s, were when the Bolsheviks blew up churches, incited civil war, and caused famine. Hatred was implanted into the people. Diakova saw all of this and recognized that the Antichrist was at work in Russia. Her book, *Shade of Antichrist*, provides a very insightful perspective. As a woman, she saw many things that men often overlook. She describes the realities of how children were made to suffer, how people slipped into sinful lives, and how these conditions brought about suffering, torture, and death—both spiritual and physical—to the people and to the whole of *Rus*.  

At that time, there was no division between Ukraine and Russia; it was all one big *Rus*, still called the USSR, but it was still *Rus*. What I see now is that the shade of the Antichrist has not abandoned that land. What we are witnessing is the next step in the Antichrist’s plan. People have become puppets in his hands.

And even church leaders—not all of them, but many—have been brainwashed. They have become victims of propaganda, believing they are preaching for a noble and divine mission, a holy mission. In reality, they have become instruments in the hands of the Antichrist. This is what is happening behind the scenes in Russia and Ukraine. I have been there, and I have seen many things.  

The question then becomes: What do we say to the young people who are now being mobilized, told they must serve in the army for their country? What do we tell them? And what do we say to their mothers, their relatives? Should we support this? There is mobilization happening in both Ukraine and Russia.  

On the level of nations, I cannot give an answer. I am not Putin, I am not the Patriarch, I am not Zelensky. If I were in their place, perhaps I would have ideas or decisions, but I do not want to speak in hypotheticals. I want to address real things—real people, real individuals.  

This is about the human level, the individual level. It is about the people who are listening to me now. Maybe you are not directly involved in this situation, but you might have Russian or Ukrainian friends. You yourself may be seeking understanding. Many people support Ukraine. Others love Russia and feel there is some truth behind the Russian stance, wondering if they should support Putin and this war.  

In any case, I will say this: To those who are called to war, my blessing is *not* to go—whether you are Ukrainian or Russian. As a priest, I do not give my blessing for going to war, even if this goes against the law. Even if you face jail, or if your life or livelihood is threatened by your decision, as a Christian, do not go. Tell your son not to go. Forbid him from going.  

In Matthew 26, the Apostle Paul said to Peter, *"Put your sword back into its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."* This is not just pacifism. In some wars, you can and should go, but in this war, no matter which side you fight for, you will die—and you will die for the Antichrist. He will have the victory. No matter which side wins, no matter what happens next, you will not see it because you will die. Your death will not bring salvation; it will serve the Antichrist, not some noble cause.  

Even if you hear this being said by a church leader or anyone else, remember: Our leader is Jesus Christ, and no one else. This is my opinion, and this is my blessing as a priest: Do not go. Do not take up arms. Do not go to war. And do not support anyone who goes to war—not in your words, not in your actions, not in your donations. If you do not want blood on your hands, no matter which side you are on, do not support this war.  

What should we do instead? First, we must pray to the Lord to save people from deceit and from falling into the hands of the Antichrist. The whole world—not just Russia and Ukraine—is slipping into this darkness unless the Lord performs a miracle in response to our prayers and actions.  

Second, if you are able, there are many other things you can do. In Russia, Ukraine, and other countries, there will be countless orphans, refugees, wounded people, and soldiers in need of care. True Christians can serve and heal these people. There is so much we can do to relieve the pain, to help those suffering from the outcomes of war, bombings, and economic consequences. This will be our ministry to the Lord.

This will be our contribution to what is happening—a contribution far more precious than taking up weapons and going out to kill people. This is the great opportunity the Lord is giving us to prove that we are true Christians. This is what we should do.  

I am not calling people to be selfish, to avoid service, or to turn against their country and lose their patriotic feelings. I am calling people to sacrifice themselves for the right cause, not for the Antichrist.  

What will happen after this? I am not offering advice for entire countries. If I were to give advice to nations, it would be to repent. To repent. But I know that not many will hear my words, and I do not see a solution for Ukraine and Russia at this moment. The Antichrist has brought this situation to a point where there seems to be no solution. No matter what you do, you lose. That is the reality.  

So, I am not providing advice for governments or nations. My call is on the individual level. We must witness love and truth. Do not get caught up in quarrels or political debates, supporting one side or the other. This will not bring any good. It will only spoil your inner peace and damage your relationships with others—all for the joy of the Antichrist and the devil.  

Instead, let us pray for everyone who is suffering, for those who are deceived, and for those who feel they have no choice. Let us pray for them. May the Lord be with them. May the Lord give us wisdom and guidance so that we can serve Him, hinder evil in this world, and hold fast to the true faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. May our lives bear fruit and testify to Him.  

God bless.
