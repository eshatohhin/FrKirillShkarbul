# To avoid delusion we need spiritual guidance

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about a spiritual superior or leader who can help us on our path of faith toward the kingdom of heaven. These days, many people complain that there are not many individuals who can guide them on this journey. To help us love Christ, we need to encounter someone who also loves Christ and is deeply devoted to Him. However, such people are so rare that we sometimes become disheartened and think, "Well, the Christian faith is just about believing in something, praying, maybe going on a pilgrimage to holy places, reading books about faith and theology, and that's about it." But the Christian faith is about being set apart from ordinary life, forgetting about ourselves, and yearning for the kingdom of heaven from morning till night. It is about being so eager to seek Christ in everything and being willing to exert tremendous effort to bear more fruit and accumulate greater treasures in heaven.

To achieve this, we need a truly good example—someone who already lives this way. We need to observe how they view things and how they handle the everyday problems of life so that we, too, can learn to manage these challenges. Some people say, "I don’t need a spiritual leader because I have the Bible, and that is enough. I learn from the Bible and from Christ directly. I don’t need anyone else." The problem, however, is that there are many different groups, even large ones, each with their own interpretation of the Bible. If we read the Bible on our own—five times, fifty times—we will eventually reach a limit in our understanding because it will be confined to our own mind. We will not become the kind of person I described earlier—someone so consumed by love for Christ. Instead, we might think, "Okay, I’ve read it many times. I know what Jesus said and what He did, and that’s enough." Without guidance, we risk becoming lukewarm in our faith or, worse, falling into heresy by believing in strange ideas or fantasies of our own making. We may end up cool in our faith, rather than fervent and passionate.

So, we can see from the history of the Christian Church, from the very beginning, that Christ Himself was the example for the apostles. They had His words in their ears, they saw Him, they saw Him after the resurrection, and He spoke to them the words of truth. They received the Holy Spirit, which also taught them directly the wisdom from God, and they went to the ends of the world, witnessing and testifying about Christ. They lived with this faith from morning till night—this was the content of their lives. They testified to others, and this was the second generation of Christians. For example, Saint Peter taught Saint Mark, and Saint Paul taught Luke, Timothy, Titus, and others. They learned to love Christ through these powerful spiritual apostles and leaders whom they saw before them and with whom they had a personal relationship.

Then came the third generation. For instance, Saint Apostle John belonged to the first generation, and the second generation included Saint Ignatius of Antioch, the Bishop of Antioch, who became a martyr. Saint Ignatius, in turn, became a teacher and spiritual leader for Saint Polycarp, the Bishop of Smyrna, representing the third generation. We see from the writings of Saint Apostle Paul that he says, "Remember your teachers in faith and try to follow their example in loving Christ, in ministry, and in testifying to this faith." This was very important—to have someone who helps you stay connected with Christ, someone who does not draw attention to themselves but to Christ, and who truly opens up this way of life, living for Christ and with Christ. This is the goal of a spiritual leader that we need and seek.

It is not about placing our responsibility upon them. Some people are afraid of taking responsibility, so they want someone to tell them, "Do this, do that," and then they say, "Well, my spiritual father told me, so it must be from God, and I will do it like that. It’s not my responsibility." This way of escaping responsibility is not the purpose and is, in fact, harmful. We need to be able to take full responsibility for what we do, what we choose, and what we decide. The purpose of a spiritual father is not to take away our responsibility but to open up within us an eagerness, a drive, and a strong motivation for following Christ, putting Him at the center, and teaching us how to view other things. If we have such a heart, we can avoid mistakes and avoid having our attention dragged away by something else.

The Church has existed for 2,000 years, and we have a great wealth of spiritual treasures. We have profound prayers, many saints, holy relics, beautiful liturgies, and deep theological discourse. All of this is very helpful and important, but sometimes, because of such abundance, people lose focus. The focus must always be on Christ. To avoid losing this focus, we need a spiritual leader, a spiritual father. But what do we do if we cannot find one? In modern times, we do not find Saint Polycarp, Saint Ignatius, or Saint Apostle Paul alive. We can read their books, but we do not find them living in our modern situation. Essentially, we need two spiritual guides to help us find Christ—the purpose is always Christ Himself. All of this is only to keep us grounded in the holy Church, the body of Christ.

One of these two guides should be a living person—someone in the Church who has strong faith, is grounded in Church life, and can always help us avoid being dragged away by distractions. There is always a risk, especially in our modern world, of losing focus. Therefore, having a spiritual guide who can keep us anchored in Christ is essential. The other guide is the collective wisdom of the Church, found in its teachings, traditions, and the lives of the saints. Together, these two guides help us stay on the path toward Christ and the kingdom of heaven.

Just reading books, even if it is the Bible, is not enough. If we only read books, we can be led astray, and we will be led astray. We need someone physical—someone we know, someone we trust, someone with whom we can communicate and talk about our lives. We need to see their life, their example, and learn from them to avoid major errors in faith. However, this alone may not be sufficient because, in our modern times, it is very difficult to find someone who is completely consumed by Christ—someone who, from morning till night, thinks and works for Christ. It is rare to find individuals like those we see in the apostolic age or even in later centuries. Therefore, we also need to find a saint—a second spiritual guide. This saint should be someone who has written extensively, so that we can read their spiritual books and literature. These writings will help us learn how to love Christ in everything, how to approach life in a Christian way, and not just through our own limited understanding.

We are fortunate that such spiritual guides are not entirely absent. For example, in ancient times, we have Saint John Chrysostom, who wrote 12 volumes of works. He discusses many issues, and from his writings, we can draw motivation and see how deeply he loved Christ. He saw Christ in everything and was driven by Christ in his life. In more modern times, we have saints like Saint Ignatius Brianchaninov and Saint Theophan the Recluse, two great Russian spiritual teachers from the 19th century who wrote extensively about the spiritual life and how to view the world through the lens of faith. In the 20th century, we have saints like Saint Nicholas of Serbia and Saint Luke of Crimea, a doctor who also wrote many profound works. There are others as well, but it is enough to find at least one saint whose writings resonate with you. Even if the reading is not always easy, you will feel that their words are coming from God, that they are teaching you to love Christ without distortion or error.

Therefore, we need two spiritual guides: one, a living person in our current life whom we can interact with and trust, and the other, a saint whose writings can guide us. Together, these two can help us build a stable and fruitful spiritual life, teaching us how to truly love Christ and avoid becoming lukewarm in our faith. This is the greatest risk—becoming neither cold nor hot, but merely warm. Christ Himself warned us: "If you do not lose your life for My sake, you will not gain it. And if you try to save your life, you will lose it." We must learn how to lose our life, how to sacrifice ourselves for Christ. He said, "Whoever does not hate this world and even his own life cannot be My disciple." We need to understand what it means to "hate this world," and the saints can teach us this. With the grace of God and His mighty hand, we can achieve this in our hearts and lives.

May the Lord help us. Do not make modern priests or YouTube blogger priests your primary spiritual leaders. While they can sometimes be helpful, what truly grounds us is a saint who has already walked this path, who has conquered the devil and all passions. We modern people still struggle with many passions and sins, so while we can offer some help to one another, a saint who has achieved holiness can guide us far more effectively. Let us seek their wisdom and example as we strive to love Christ with all our hearts, souls, and strength.

Indeed, a saint can truly help us immensely, and we can also ask for their prayers. May the Lord guide you on this path, grant you wisdom, strength, and a deep motivation and eagerness to follow Christ in your life. May God bless you abundantly.
