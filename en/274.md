# Absurdization of the Truth A beloved twist of Leviathan

Dear brothers and sisters, my second-to-last video was about fake traditionalisms, and today I want to talk about something that applies to the modern world and is a significant issue right now, okay? Almost any news you hear now is related to this, and we will examine it from a biblical perspective using the concept of "Leviathan." I have also made videos about "Leviathan" that you can revisit, okay? But in a nutshell, "Leviathan" represents the cooperation between the devil—this evil spirit, or Satan, who is against God—and people and systems, okay? These systems can be governments, organizations, social norms, or whatever else serves the purposes of this evil spirit.

Okay, so this is seen on both individual and institutional or social levels, okay? This might sound like a very abstract idea, but it is something that is very real, okay? This is, if you will, the world we read about in ascetic literature—this evil force that represents the darkness of this world. This is what the Apostle Paul was referring to when he said that our fight is against these principalities of darkness, not against flesh and blood. So, it is more spiritual than physical, but it eventually has its physical manifestations, okay?

So, "Leviathan" is inspired by the devil, okay? The devil is depicted as a snake in the Holy Scripture because it is twisting, binding, and not moving straight, okay? You cannot really say it is here or there because it is always winding back and forth, okay, trying to escape the truth. There is no truth in the devil; he is the liar and the father of all lies. So, whenever there is an agenda that the devil is pushing, he will also have something seemingly opposing this agenda so that he can switch back and forth at any time. This is why Marxists and socialists love the idea of dialectics—materialistic or historical dialectics—which come from Hegel, Kabbalah, and the concept of the winding snake, the Ouroboros, if you will. All these things are related.

To simplify, okay, we can say that there is outright evil being propagated mainly through ultra-liberal and post-Christian values, and it is being imposed on all societies, okay? Wherever they can do it easily, they do so, knowing that not everyone will agree. In some countries, the reaction to these things is weak, and therefore, on a national level, that agenda has been accomplished, including in Taiwan, for example. In 2019, same-sex couples gained legal approval. And this is just the tip of the iceberg; it is not all about same-sex relationships, okay? There is a whole big agenda against gender, against the family, okay, advancing all kinds of satanic ideas—re-abortion, euthanasia, and many other things, okay? It all boils down to what they say is right, not what the Bible or your conscience tells you, okay? So, there is no sin if they say there is no sin, okay? All kinds of immoral lifestyles are acceptable if they are legal or allowed by them, okay? They shape your mind, your conscience, and it all becomes very unchristian, very hedonistic. It can take different shapes and forms, okay? Let's leave it there for now.

So, they know that not everyone is going to be supportive, so what do they do about that? Well, first, you know, every one of us, when we encounter someone who does not live by Christian faith—someone with postmodernist values or a secular, so-called progressive mindset—if you tell them anything about chastity, Christian family values, Christian education of children, or the Christian role of women, they will twist it in a way that makes you sound absurd, like a clown, okay? They will say, "Oh, you believe in some old guy in the sky who created everything in a second? You believe what? That there’s no science? You’re against evolution? You’re against everything? Maybe you think the earth is flat?" They will make you sound stupid and make you feel like a fool, especially if it’s in front of others. 

Or they’ll accuse you of being against women, okay? A good example is if you weren’t supportive of all those procedures they were pushing three years ago, or if you had doubts about why everyone had to wear certain things. They’d say, "You’re against life, you’re a looter, you’re an enemy of society, you came from the caves, you don’t believe in science or progress. We’re saving humanity!" And it sounds super persuasive because all the media, everything, is pushing that narrative. They’ve been brainwashing people. These examples are more on an individual level, okay? Just to give you a sense of what I’m talking about. 

But on a global level, what’s happening now? There’s a big twist by Leviathan, and what is this twist about? It’s about eradicating basic moral values or anything left of Christian faith and morality—to sweep it away for good, okay? Not just on an individual level. If there are a few individuals, he can tolerate that; it’s not a big danger. But if there’s a group or a country where the majority still holds to these values, which don’t fit his plans, he needs to do something about it. So now, by splitting the world, he’s trying to achieve that, okay? 

How does he do it? He radicalizes two things. On one side, he radicalizes the liberal agenda, making it look aggressive, ugly, and pushy—like we saw in the opening of the Olympics in Paris, which was a blasphemy against Christianity and all basic moral values. On the other hand, he says, "You don’t want that? Come here." Where? You know where, right? All these rightists—be it in Russia, certain parties in Europe, the so-called Global South, or even China, which is supposedly left but now seems more right—he can play around with all of them. 

So, what does he do? He tells you, "You value family, traditional values, faith, and you’re anti-globalist? Come here. We’ll protect you, we’ll push your values, okay? But we’ll add something else to it." Like what? Like war. You’ll have to go to war to protect us. Or fascism—you’ll have to accept a fascist dictatorship or something like that, okay? So, you either go there or come here with us. And they’ll make it so ugly that eventually, everyone will be against it. In their plan, they hope this won’t survive.

This is similar to what happened in Germany, okay? In Germany, before the Second World War, there were traditional values, stronger families, culture, German ideals, spirit, and things like that. These were exploited by whom? Well, by the devil, okay, but Hitler just happened to be his instrument, okay? And this group that came to power—actually, Hitler’s rise to power was facilitated by sodomites, okay? This is historical fact. They had riots and essentially eliminated anyone who opposed them through their storm squads, okay? These squads were headed by figures like Ernst Röhm, okay, and many of them were sodomites. You can research this story, but that’s not the main point. 

The main point is that they presented themselves as though they were bringing true values, okay? Before their rise, they said, "You see, the German nation is being perverted. We have capitalism, people are only seeking profit, they’re trading, they’re so lowly, so earthly. We will give you ideals, the future of the German nation. We are like neo-gods, the whole Reich, okay? It’s coming—a thousand-year Reich. It will be so great. We are inspired and ideological." Many people believed this. They thought, "These guys are heroes, okay? Not like those bankers who are just exploiting people financially." So, people said yes, and what did it lead to? 

It led to massive war, the Holocaust, okay? That’s another story—killing so many people, not only Jews but also gypsies, Poles, and many others. They said, "This is what you wanted." The whole world was horrified when they saw the monster that emerged from this. And later, when Hitler was defeated, the German nation was essentially destroyed. They were reprogrammed, brainwashed, and became unable to maintain any culture or strong morals, okay? It was all ruined. They had to accept the new world order—liberal, cosmopolitan, and essentially capitalistic, earthly, hedonistic values—and merged into this Western post-Christian, liberal framework.

So, similar outcomes would be achieved if their plan succeeds, okay? They want to radicalize all those who oppose this liberal agenda, and now it’s not just Germany—it’s the whole world, okay? It’s not just Russia, of course; it’s the entire world. Whoever is still against these values and this agenda, they say, "Come here, okay? We will fight, we will resist." But eventually, it will become so ugly, so monstrous, that no one will want anything to do with it, okay? It will all be processed and absorbed into the new world order they aim to build, which won’t necessarily be liberal or capitalist or anything like that, okay? It will be something else entirely. It will be ruled by Apollyon, this spirit who will become the god for all. This is what they want—for everyone to listen to him, to accept what he says as truth and value, okay? There will be no more strong convictions or beliefs tied to Christianity or even Islam, okay? The Muslim world will also be ruined, but for them, it’s already marginalized, okay? Islam and all its traditions are seen as local, limited, and lacking the potential to influence the entire world, okay?

So, this is what’s happening right now. Today, I don’t want to talk about politics or geopolitics or war. I just want all of you to keep in mind, okay, that Leviathan is wise, and the Antichrist is called the genius of geniuses. We must remain detached from any propaganda, manipulation, or attempts to involve us in movements or causes, okay? They will try to stir up our emotions, to make us feel like we have to fight, to go somewhere, to do something. But the greatest thing we can do is to improve our spiritual lives. If we can save someone’s life, okay, we do that, but we must not become part of this deadly game of Apollyon, who seeks to destroy human souls and bodies. 

May the Lord give us wisdom and peace in our hearts so that we are not overwhelmed by what’s happening. He is not God, okay? He is trying to do his thing, but every day we are given is a great treasure. We can still use this day, and every day we use rightly—if we avoid falling into passions, if we bear witness to Christian love—we spoil the plans of these evil forces. The greater the darkness, the greater the achievements each of us can have, and these will be pleasing to the Lord. They will bring great spiritual benefit to us, to those around us, and perhaps even to people far away. 

May the Lord strengthen our prayers, give us wisdom and strength, and preserve us in every tribulation, deception, and temptation. God bless you, brothers and sisters.
