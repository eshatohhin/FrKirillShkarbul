# Mission in Sri Lanka what happened since my last visit

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am in Sri Lanka, and I want to share with you a little about the development of the mission here.  

If you recall, the last time I came here was in January 2022. At that time, five people were baptized in Sri Lanka—the first baptisms ever to take place in this country. Since then, ten months have passed. We had planned to send priests here in March and then again in the summer, but unfortunately, no one was able to come. As a result, there was a great need, and so I have come now. I will share more about my trip next time.  

Today, I want to tell you about what has been happening here over these past ten months and the progress of the mission.  

You may know that Sri Lanka has faced significant challenges. When I last visited, the country was grappling with COVID-19, and there were many travel restrictions. I was coming from Russia at the time, and there were numerous forms to fill out and other complications. Now, however, there are almost no restrictions.  

But the country has undergone major political changes. A new president was elected, and there have been widespread riots and a severe economic crisis. The cost of oil has risen sharply, and there are shortages of power, groceries, and other essentials. The country is facing many difficulties.  

One of the reasons I came this time was to help provide basic necessities. We initiated a humanitarian relief project to assist displaced families and those in disadvantaged situations who had to move from one place to another. This was one of the key efforts we undertook.  

Despite all these challenges and changes, the mission here has continued to grow. Last time, five people were baptized—five Sri Lankans, one from the south and four from the central town of Kurunegala. This town is now home to the first Orthodox community.  

This community was originally part of a charismatic sect. Their pastor, whose baptismal name is Makarios (his Orthodox name), came to realize that they were part of a sect and that the true Church—the original faith—is the Orthodox faith. He was baptized along with his family and his helper, Elijah, in a lake.  

Over the past ten months, this entire community has been preparing for baptism. They have become catechumens, learning to conduct services in the Orthodox way. They have also been learning how to bake prosphora (offering bread) in the Orthodox tradition, as it was done in the past.  

Additionally, they have organized a youth group for students, holding classes and activities, as well as forming a sisterhood. They also started a summer school. All of these developments have taken place since January.  

With the Lord's help, they have also found a new and larger place for their church. Unlike their previous location in a rural area, this new place is in the center of Kurunegala. More people are now coming to the church, and the government provided this space at a very low cost—about three to five times cheaper than the market price. This was truly a blessing from the Lord.  

Thank you, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon.

These are some wonderful developments. In addition to the progress mentioned earlier, they have been actively engaged in ministry. Makarios, the former pastor and now our missionary, has been visiting homes regularly—teaching, talking, praying, and helping people. This outreach has been fruitful.  

They have also been translating services. The Typika service for Sundays has been translated, and I printed copies in Taiwan to distribute here. The community is learning to chant, though it doesn’t yet sound fully Orthodox. Still, they have formed a chanter group or choir, which is a positive step.  

The mission has also expanded to other areas. They have traveled to different regions, such as the south, including the Skol area, and other places. Several pastors have shown interest in Orthodoxy and are now open to meeting with Orthodox missionaries and considering conversion. This was another reason I needed to come.  

However, there have been challenges as well. In the north, which is a Hindu-majority area inhabited by the Tamil community (who have their own language and religion), we had a pastor who was very active. We had an agreement with him, but another heretical group offered him a substantial salary, and he left. He abandoned his journey toward Orthodoxy to join them. This is a reminder of how mammon—wealth and material resources—can be used to pull people away from the true faith.  

The mission here is full of challenges and hardships. For example, one of our Orthodox members, Andrew (a former pastor), has a son named Aaron who fell ill and had to undergo surgery. Please keep Aaron in your prayers.  

Despite these difficulties, the mission is developing and growing quickly. This is why it was necessary for me to come. In October, Taiwan lifted its quarantine restrictions, making travel easier, and I was finally able to make this trip.  

Please pray for this mission, for the Orthodox Sri Lankans, and for the upcoming mission in India. Next time, I will share more about what I have done and where I have been. Hopefully, we can also create a short video to show everything happening here.  

May the Lord help us, bless us, and give us strength and unity. Let us ask Him to guide us in spreading the mission to everyone on this planet. God bless.
