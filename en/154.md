# Ascension He sends us to fight Leviathan

Dear brothers and sisters, today we celebrate the Ascension of the Lord. After forty days of appearing to His disciples, the resurrected Christ ascended to the heavens. He promised them that He would send the Holy Spirit, who would bring them the promise of the Father, the blessing of the Covenant, this chosenness. They would be baptized with the Holy Spirit and receive power from on high so that they could be witnesses of His passion and resurrection to the whole world.  

Today, we receive this mission. We are commissioned by the ascended Christ to go to the ends of the world, beginning from Jerusalem, to every nation, and bring this testimony. Very often, however, we do not feel this commission. We do not feel this mission. We are lazy apostles—sent, but unwilling to go.  

One reason for this is that when we discover ourselves in this mission, we are lazy. We are shackled by our own lifestyles, our own selfishness, and our own ideas. We do not move; we are handicapped. We do not even understand this commission. This happens because there is a power called evil that is out there. As soon as you try to follow Christ on this path and undertake this mission, you will encounter great obstacles.  

Today, I want to speak about these obstacles because the main battle we face is a spiritual one. If we do not fight, nothing will happen. This spiritual battle also has a material, physical component to it. From the Ascension, we learn that there is no real separation between the spiritual and the physical, for the physical Lord—with His wounds, with His body—ascended to heaven. Right now, there is no separation between the two. He says, "I will be with you till the end of the age, until my second coming."  

Of course, all these things are mind-blowing and difficult to understand. But one thing we can grasp is that there is no real separation between the two worlds. What we do now in this physical, material world may have spiritual value and significance. In the same way, this evil power also uses the material world to achieve spiritual goals.  

So, what is this power? Who is behind it? The main figure behind it is the devil. We do not know what the devil is, where the devil is, or who the devil is. Usually, when we think about evil, we think of evil people—those who wage wars, commit genocide, kill, murder, steal, and deceive. All of that is evil to us. But we need to have a deeper sense of this evil. We can talk about its spiritual side and its spiritual significance.  

First, beginning with ourselves, we need to see evil within us. We need to see the antichrist within us. Only then can we recognize it in other places. There is a tendency among people to either say that everything is evil, that the antichrist is everywhere, leading to paranoia and fear, or to deny the existence of evil altogether, claiming that it is just about people, ideas, and that we need not worry. "Just read the Bible," they say, "learn how to love people. Don’t think about evil, the devil, or the end of the world. Just don’t think about it." This is like a spiritual lullaby, lulling us to sleep, telling us to stay asleep, to remain unaware, and to ignore any threats.  

But as soon as we truly desire to fulfill our mission, as soon as we genuinely want to do something for Christ, we encounter this power. Something can be said and known about this evil force that exists. From the Book of Job, in chapters 40 and 41, we read about Leviathan. Leviathan is not a crocodile, as some might think. It is a metaphorical representation of the devil himself.  

Let’s read a few verses. I recommend reading all of chapter 41, but to keep it brief, I will select a few verses, starting from verse 9.

"Shall not one be cast down, even at the sight of him?"  
He is so mighty, so powerful, that "none is so fierce as to dare stir him up.  
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.  
Who can discover the face of his garment?  
Or who can come to him with a double bridle?  
Who can open the doors of his face?  
His teeth are terrible all around; his scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.  
They are so near to one another that no air can come between them.  
They are joined one to another; they stick together and cannot be parted.  
By his sneezings a light shines, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.  
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.  
Out of his nostrils comes smoke, as from a seething pot or cauldron.  
His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.  
His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.  
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of his crashings they purify themselves.  
The sword that reaches him cannot avail, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin.  
He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.  
The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned to stubble for him.  

This passage describes how fearsome and awe-inspiring this beast is. At the end, it concludes: "He beholds every high thing; he is king over all the children of pride."  
So, he is the king of all those kings and queens, all those great masters of this world who are driven by pride, vainglory, greed, and the lust for power. This is a description of the devil.  

Of course, we must not promote the idea that the devil rules the world. By no means does he. He tries to pretend that he has great power, that he is a god. But he is not. He is merely mimicking, pretending to be god. It is all a facade. Just as you can chase him away by calling on the name of the Lord, by repenting, and by attaching yourself to the truth, you can cast him out of any place.  

Only spiritual weapons can overcome this enemy. We see that no armor, no material instruments, nothing can truly harm him. It is only spiritual force that can overthrow him. This is the highest level of power in the spiritual battle.  

Very often, we ask, "Who is ruling the world?" We need at least some understanding. What we see is not what we read in the newspapers. China, America, Russia—they are all trying. This is a very simplistic understanding. Conspiracy theories often claim that there are people behind the scenes who truly rule the world. While this is partly true—there are indeed people with more power than presidents—it is more complicated than that.  

It is not just about people; there are also processes at work. There is an objective reality unfolding—what Marx described as material conditions. We have different countries, nations, economic relationships, technologies, and so on. These have their own logic and ways of developing. This is also part of the reality that exists, and it is not directly controlled. It can be shaped and guided in certain directions by those in power, but it is not merely a tool they can use however they wish.  

Once a process begins—for example, a war starts somewhere, or a figure like Hitler rises to power, perhaps with the help of those in the shadows—it develops its own logic. It cannot be entirely predicted or controlled.

And there is also the information sphere, which some call the "digital Leviathan," that seeks to control people's minds and hearts—their values—through gadgets, social networks, media, and similar tools. When I speak with people in various countries—whether in Europe, Russia, or the United States—I see that many are guided in their thinking. They believe they are free and that their ideas are their own, but in reality, those ideas were designed by others and implanted into the minds of the population.  

This digital Leviathan has many ways of controlling people's feelings, emotions, actions, desires, and dreams. For example, many people know little about their own country but are convinced that another country, like Iran, is entirely bad. They are fed a worldview, told who is good and who is bad, and what is happening in the world. This is not just the work of individuals; there are entire institutions dedicated to shaping opinions, behaviors, and mass movements. They have a vast array of tools at their disposal.  

But above all of this lies the spiritual battle between Leviathan—Satan, the contender, the antagonist of God—and the forces of good. This is not a game; it is real. Satan is called the deceiver, the thief, the supplier of all sorrows and weeping in this world. He is a betrayer, betraying nations and breaking every promise he makes. He is busy, with thousands of years of experience deceiving humanity, and he never sleeps. He is always on guard.  

Yet, despite all this, we still have freedom in Christ. We can chase him away by relying on Christ. Satan tries to deceive everyone, flattering them, telling them they are brilliant, creative, and powerful. Many world leaders and industry leaders are driven by this deception. To those who love sin, he gives them over to sin—perverts, degenerates, and those with psychological disorders or complexes like a Napoleon complex. He uses ideologies—socialism, fascism, capitalism—playing them like instruments whenever it suits him.  

He tries to mimic God, like a monkey imitating its master, pretending to be a dictator with power and glory. But we must understand his logic: he does everything opposite to what the Lord does, working from behind the scenes. This evil is an objective reality, as tangible as the material world. He seeks to destroy everything holy, good, and pure, building a pyramid of control over the world. Our task is to break that pyramid, to undermine it.  

This is why it is so important to recognize the evil within ourselves first. Only then can we see that we are commissioned, that we are apostles sent by the Lord on the day of His Ascension. We are called to wage war against this evil. Some say, "We agree, but we can only pray. We are small people; we cannot influence anything." This is an attempt to hide and avoid responsibility. We have our safe havens, our little rooms, where we stay warm and comfortable.  

But we must move beyond that. We must act. Prayer is essential, but it is not enough. We are called to do something physical, to take action in the world. We cannot simply hide and hope for the best. We are part of this mission, and we must fight this spiritual battle with both prayer and action.

We need to be brave and proactive, knowing that each of us can play a significant role in this war—this apocalyptic battle. We must go out and take action, casting out this Leviathan. Let us be wise and pray that the Holy Spirit is with us, guiding us, empowering us, and filling us with eagerness to serve the Lord. Let us do everything for Him, overthrowing all selfishness and limitations, and bringing victory to Christ.  

May it be so. A blessed Ascension of the Lord to you all. Amen. God bless.
