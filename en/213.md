# Are we ready for the worse Fears vs. Fantasies.

Dear brothers and sisters, I have returned from my mission in Sri Lanka. By the grace of God, it was very successful. In the following video, I will share more about the situation there and what transpired. Today, I want to share some thoughts with you—thoughts on the current state of affairs, the spiritual condition of the Church, and where we are headed as a community of faith. I also want to reflect on how we should face these challenges.

From what I observe among Church members and in the broader context, it seems we are standing on the edge of a precipice. Significant upheavals are approaching. The Lord Himself foretold that there would be wars and rumors of wars, and news of future conflicts. Yet, we must not be afraid, for all these things must come to pass, though they do not signify the end. We have already witnessed wars, epidemics, and economic crises, and there will be more to come—perhaps even worse than what we have experienced before.

The faith we see in the Church today is not the same as it was in the early days of Christianity. Back then, there was a profound sense of brotherly love within communities. Believers were willing to sacrifice everything for Christ, placing their complete trust in the Lord. They devoted themselves to prayer, often praying through the night. Sadly, we do not see such devotion today. 

What do we see instead? Even among us Christians, faith has grown weak. We are reluctant to let go of worldly attachments—our pursuit of wealth and comfort. We shy away from prayer and asceticism. The brotherly love that once defined us has faded, and our resolve to serve the Lord has diminished. Even within monasteries, including the most esteemed ones, faith is faltering.

The Lord Himself asked, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?" This suggests that faith will become so scarce that it will seem almost nonexistent. People will continue with their lives—building houses, marrying, and pursuing earthly endeavors—but faith will be absent. Materialism, self-interest, and worldly pursuits will dominate. People will become entirely consumed by this earthly life, leaving no room for spiritual devotion.

The Church today is in a dire state, both spiritually and in its operations. There is an ongoing effort to reprogram the Church, to transform it into an "anti-church." We have seen similar patterns in history—for instance, when the Old Testament Church devolved into Talmudism and practices of idolatry, or when the Roman Catholic Church strayed from its true purpose, becoming an entity opposed to the spirit of Christ's true Church. Now, we are witnessing attempts to drag the Orthodox Church into this same anti-church framework.

What do I mean by "anti-church"? I mean a Church that becomes a tool for the agendas of the New World Order. It becomes an instrument of propaganda, serving not the Kingdom of God but the interests of a global system. This agenda is already unfolding on a national level and will eventually extend globally. The Church will be subjugated to this agenda, with its teachings and language superficially resembling the Gospel—speaking of humility, love, and sacrifice—but its core message will be the opposite. It will promote self-indulgence, heresies, and humanism, all cloaked in traditional, church-like packaging.

This is the reality we face, and it is a call to vigilance and steadfastness in our faith. Let us not be deceived by appearances but remain rooted in the truth of Christ's teachings.

And of course, we believe in the one, holy, true, Catholic, and apostolic Church. The Church will endure until the end of time. I firmly believe that the plans to undermine it will ultimately fail. However, these plans may take on such distorted forms that, at some point, even true Christians may become disoriented and uncertain about what is true. This is where the responsibility of us, the pastors of the Church, comes into play. We must first understand where the danger lies, recognize it, and then guide the flock to avoid it.

So, what is this danger, and where does it come from? To begin with, there are two extremes that often emerge in such times. The first is apocalyptic thinking—an overly negative outlook. People may say, "Everything is falling apart; the world is ending. Evil is triumphing, and people are turning away from God. Things are only getting worse, and there’s nothing we can do." This mindset leads to passivity, as individuals feel powerless to influence the situation, believing that the Lord has allowed it to happen. Such pessimism breeds despondency and a lack of initiative, causing Christians to falter in their spiritual battles. If we adopt this attitude, we are destined to fail as soldiers of Christ.

The second extreme, which is even more common, is an overly optimistic outlook. People may say, "Everything will be fine. Yes, bad things are happening, but the Lord will turn them around for good. The good guys will win, and everything will work out in the end." While this may sound comforting, it often leads to complacency. Believers may think, "We don’t need to do anything; everything will resolve itself." This is a form of escapism, a refusal to face reality. It reflects a naive belief in predestination—that everything is already decided and will turn out well without any effort on our part. This attitude ignores the Lord’s call to vigilance and action.

The Lord warns us to be vigilant and not to fall asleep. He cautions us that people will rise against us, dragging us before synagogues and judges to condemn us, but we must bear witness to His name. He also warns that the day of judgment will come suddenly, like a net cast over everyone living on earth. This is not only about the final judgment but also about the sudden trials and temptations that can arise in our lives. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world almost overnight, changing life as we knew it. Similarly, the advent of the internet transformed society in a short span of time, bringing both positive and negative consequences. Major shifts, like the Industrial Revolution, have also reshaped the world suddenly. We must be prepared for such events, as they can come upon us unexpectedly.

Today, I want to reflect with you on how we should respond to these challenges. There are two unhelpful approaches I’ve mentioned: one is fear—being consumed by negativity and fear of the Antichrist—and the other is fantasy—believing that everything will magically work out in our favor. Some people place their hope in the idea of an Orthodox Tsar who will overthrow the Antichrist. Others believe that common sense will prevail or that we, as Christians, are clever enough to outmaneuver the forces of evil. These are fantasies, not grounded in the reality of our spiritual struggle.

Instead, we must adopt a balanced approach—one rooted in faith, vigilance, and action. We must recognize the dangers around us, remain steadfast in our devotion to Christ, and actively work to strengthen our faith and the faith of others. Let us not be swayed by fear or lulled into complacency by false optimism. The Lord calls us to be watchful and prepared, trusting in His guidance while taking responsibility for our spiritual lives. Together, with His grace, we can navigate these turbulent times and remain faithful to the end.

This mindset is very immature. For us, as Christians, we must be prepared to face each day as if it were our last. Today could very well be the final day of my life, and that is why I have no fear about tomorrow. The Lord Himself said, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own." Instead of fearing the future, we must focus on the tasks before us today. What can we do today? We must do the works of the Lord—bear witness to His name, serve Him, and seek His kingdom in truth. This is what we should be concerned about.

Our attitude toward our ministry as Christians, whether it is missionary work, serving others through our jobs, caring for our families, or overcoming our own passions, is crucial. These are our tasks, and we must approach them with confidence. The task should fear us, not the other way around. For example, imagine you are a chef in a restaurant tasked with preparing meals for a hundred people. If you are afraid of the workload, if you doubt your ability to complete it, you will likely fail. But if you approach the task with determination, saying, "This is what needs to be done, and I will do it," the work itself will yield to your efforts. The same principle applies to our spiritual lives.

Our task as Christians is to overcome evil—to chase away the demons within us, to conquer our old selves, our passions, and the influence of the Antichrist in this world. We are here to overthrow these forces, not to cower before them. The Antichrist should fear us, not the other way around. This is the attitude we must adopt toward evil in this world. Of course, this boldness and assurance do not come from our own strength. We are not superheroes capable of defeating the Antichrist on our own. It is only because we are with the Lord that we can overcome any demon, any passion, or any evil.

Many people live in fear of their passions, as if they are snakes that can strike at any moment. But we should not fear these passions; rather, they should fear us. Only then can we trample them underfoot and rid ourselves of their influence. As the Apostle Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 3:17, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." If we are afraid of the future, afraid of the Antichrist, afraid of crises, wars, or pandemics, we are not living in the freedom of the Spirit. Fear indicates a lack of trust in God's presence and power.

No matter what crises may come—whether tomorrow, next month, or years from now—we must be ready. These challenges should not weaken us but should instead make us stronger and more alert. For example, if you have ever been robbed or had something important stolen, you likely learned a lesson from that experience. You became more cautious, more aware of how to protect your belongings. Similarly, if you have ever overeaten or consumed something harmful and become ill, you learned to be more mindful of what you eat. These experiences teach us to be vigilant and prepared.

In the same way, the trials and crises we face in life should awaken us spiritually. They should remind us to stay close to the Lord, to rely on His strength, and to remain steadfast in our faith. Let us not be paralyzed by fear or lulled into complacency. Instead, let us face each day with courage, knowing that the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and in Him, we have the freedom and power to overcome all things.

When you experience sickness or hardship, you learn from it. You realize what not to do and become more cautious. In the same way, when the devil strikes or challenges arise, we must not fall into despondency or depression. Instead, we must grow stronger and more alert. These trials should awaken us, not weaken us. This is the mindset I want to emphasize today.

If you’ve been following global events, you may have noticed that things are deteriorating. However, as Christians, we should not become overly obsessed or consumed by these developments. Our primary concern is to remain with Christ during these dark times. In times of temptation, we must stand firm in our faith. As the Apostle Paul reminds us, we stand in the grace of the Lord. We must be vigilant, aware of the dangers, and ensure that we do not fall away. Let us put in the effort to stay close to the Lord and grow stronger, even as faith grows weaker around us—even in the most respected monasteries, where faith has become feeble.

The Church is undergoing attempts to be reprogrammed into an "anti-church," but in these dark times, we must become beacons of light and pillars of faith. We must remain unshaken in the face of temptation and challenges. May the Lord bless you, strengthen your faith, and protect you from all evil and temptation. Devotion is key. God bless.
