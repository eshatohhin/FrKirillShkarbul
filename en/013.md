# What are “the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven”

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about a fundamental question: What are the keys to the kingdom of heaven? In Matthew 16:19, Jesus tells the Apostle Peter, "I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." These words are very mysterious, and many thinkers and holy people have pondered and discussed this topic extensively.

We know what a key is. We need a key to enter a house, to open a computer program, or to access a computer with a password. The notion of a key is significant because the kingdom of heaven is portrayed as a castle with gates, and to enter this castle, you need these keys. What are these keys, and how do we obtain them? We also recall Christ's words that the path to the kingdom of heaven is very narrow and difficult to walk. Very few people find this path and follow it, as some find it but choose not to walk it. However, many walk the wide path, which leads to destruction. How do we find this narrow path? The Lord says that on the day of judgment, many will try to enter the kingdom of heaven. No one wants to go to hell at that point, but they will not be able to enter. Therefore, let us think deeply about this question, seek this path, and have the will and desire to walk it.

First, we need to look at the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, priests had the authority to declare someone clean or unclean ritually. For example, if someone touched a dead body, interacted with pagans, committed sins, or even went to the market, they would need a ritual of purification to be cleansed. Minor impurities could be addressed by individuals themselves using containers of water called mikvahs, where they would cleanse themselves. However, more serious issues, such as diseases like leprosy and other plagues, required examination by a priest. The priest would determine if the person was clean and could rejoin society or if they were still unclean and needed to be quarantined and separated from the community. This authority was a form of key, granting freedom to return to normal life. However, this was a prophecy of the fullness that would come with Jesus Christ.

To understand what Christ is saying about the keys to the kingdom of heaven, we must consider another teaching. The Holy Fathers, such as Saint Macarius the Great, tell us that the Word of God is a key to the human heart. This key opens the heart, enters it, and transforms the person, bringing forth fruit in faith. Why do we have these locked doors in our hearts? Saint Macarius explains that when Adam and Eve sinned by disobeying God, these doors were closed.

The devil, through sin, entered into the hearts of Adam and Eve, closing the gates of their hearts. As a result, they became blind, separated from God, and unable to receive the blessings they would have otherwise received. This is what happened to Adam and Eve, and it is what happens to each of us. When we sin, that sin enters a gate of our heart, closing it and festering inside like a virus, a sickness, or filth. Over time, our hearts become increasingly selfish, driven by desires, passions, and vices. We grow indifferent to the opinions and needs of others. This is why we often say, "An adult cannot change; they are already set in their ways." By the time a person reaches adulthood, they have committed so many sins that their heart becomes hardened. The doors, windows, and even the smallest cracks of their soul are sealed shut from the inside. Sin has blocked all paths to their heart, making it difficult to form deep friendships later in life. Both individuals have closed hearts, and finding a key to someone else's heart becomes a challenge.

This is the reality we face. However, the Word of God has the power to open these sealed and closed doors of our hearts. It can enter, cleanse us from within, and transform us completely. This transformation is possible if we allow the Word of God to bear fruit, penetrate our hearts, renew us, and fill us with light and true life. This is the first key.

To enter the Kingdom of Heaven, it is not enough to merely know the Word of God or understand the direction we must walk. We must also bear fruit. The Holy Fathers teach that it is our deeds—actions based on our knowledge of God's will and His commandments—that become the key to entering the Kingdom of Heaven. Of course, we do not accomplish this on our own; God helps us. But we must actively participate. This path is not automatic; it requires effort. We must walk through thorns, face challenges, and overcome obstacles. Only by persevering in this way can we enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

We also remember that the Lord gave the keys to the Apostle Peter after his confession. Peter declared, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus responded that this understanding was revealed to Peter by God the Father, not by flesh and blood. This confession—acknowledging that Jesus Christ is our Savior, the Son of God, and the source of our life and meaning—is the key that can bring us into the Kingdom of Heaven.

In addition to this, the Church has been entrusted with the keys to bind and to loose. This is the authority that Christ Himself possessed, as He had the power to forgive sins. Before His ascension, He promised to give this power to His disciples after His resurrection. After rising from the dead, He granted this authority to His disciples, empowering them not merely to restore ritual cleanliness but to lead people to eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven. This ministry, which Christ began in Jerusalem, was expanded to the entire world through the Church. The Church now carries the authority to bring all people into the Kingdom of Heaven, particularly through the sacrament of confession.

We cannot simply say, "It's just me and God, and that's enough." The Church, established by Christ, is essential to our salvation. We are saved not merely as individuals but as members of the Church, united with God the Father in the mystical body of Jesus Christ. Let us remember this truth and live in repentance and virtue. Our deeds grant us access to Christian virtues. By performing virtuous acts, we grow stronger in those virtues. For example, by giving to others, we cultivate charity, love, and compassion. Sometimes, we must even force ourselves to act virtuously to transform our hearts. Let us strive to live in this way, free from sin. Sin binds us, making us unfree and unable to move forward. It is a self-imposed bondage that hinders our spiritual progress.

The Church does not impose restrictions to limit us but to protect us. It warns us that certain actions and thoughts will bind us, harm us, and leave us spiritually handicapped. The Lord desires for us to live righteously, in truth, walking on the waters of faith. He wants us to reject sin and passion, allowing them to bounce away without taking root in our hearts. May the Lord grant us such a heart, filled with courage, and may He lead us into the splendor of His glory.
