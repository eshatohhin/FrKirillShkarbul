# How covid changes people

To your brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about how these pandemics have influenced people and how we are changing.  
It has been over a year since this began all over the world, and we can already draw some conclusions.  
By observing what is happening, we can try to become stronger, avoid some of these negative influences, and help others around us to do the same—strengthening their faith instead of being broken.  

The first thing that is obvious is that people have become alienated from one another.  
Social connections and interactions between individuals have weakened or been broken.  
While we communicate through Zoom, Skype, or the internet, it is very different from face-to-face interaction.  
There are many things we wouldn’t say over the phone. We need to meet people, socialize, share a cup of tea, and talk with them.  
Now, this has become impossible for many or occurs very rarely.  
Some people are locked down in their rooms, isolated and divided.  
Others are perceived as a source of threat, disease, or even death.  
As a result, we have become afraid of one another, more selfish, and our instincts—our egoistic instincts—have come to the surface.  
Some think, “I have my own castle here in my room, and if others die, it’s their problem.”  
This mindset has grown.  
Some people have even become sociopathic, avoiding others out of fear.  
These psychological problems have emerged.  

Of course, the devil seeks to divide people, and we can see this happening.  
Most of what I will discuss today is not conspiracy theory but an objective look at what is happening and its spiritual implications for Christian life and church communities.  

We also see that fear is being propagated.  
People’s will is being broken.  
Fear is everywhere—people are afraid of the future, of being stuck, of having no way out.  
Many are experiencing depression and other psychological issues.  
Families are facing intense quarrels and domestic violence.  
There is a widespread loss of purpose in life.  
People ask, “Why do I live? All my plans are ruined.”  
Many have turned to alcoholism or drugs.  
I know you are aware of these issues, but today I want to summarize them.  

One important observation is that people are losing their identity with the use of masks.  
They have become like shadows walking around.  
While we can never fully know a person’s soul, their face often gives us a sense of who they are.  
Now, however, everyone is hidden, and it feels like a world without identity—a world of mass culture and mass thinking.  
People are less likely to think for themselves.  
This trend existed before, but the pandemic has worsened it.  
You are no longer seen as an individual.  

Additionally, people are becoming less reliant on their own abilities and talents and more dependent on government subsidies, restrictions, and laws.  
They seek salvation not from the Savior but from external sources.  
This dependency is growing, and many of the freedoms and democratic values that the developed world once strived for are being forfeited.  
It is a tricky situation—presented as being for your benefit, but in reality, it diminishes you.  
Small businesses and the middle class are being slowly destroyed, leaving most people deprived of property and rights.  
Only a select few will thrive, while the majority are pushed to a lower level.  

These are the challenges we face, but by recognizing them, we can work to strengthen our faith, support one another, and resist the forces that seek to divide and weaken us.

And now, transportation is limited—where you can go, where you can travel.  
These restrictions are becoming normalized, and people are growing accustomed to them.  
Similarly, people are also becoming accustomed to total surveillance.  
As I discussed in my last video about AI, every contact and movement is monitored, and people are accepting this as normal.  

Another critical issue is that people are being pulled away from the church.  
They are becoming alienated from it.  
For over a year, many have not attended church or have gone only a few times.  
Now, they are being told, “It’s the same thing. You don’t really need to go. You can watch services on TV, and that’s good enough—maybe even better, more comfortable.”  
But the fundamental principle of Christianity is that we gather together as a church.  
Only then are we the body of Christ—not as individuals, but as a collective.  
This truth is becoming less important to people, and the idea of “God in my heart” is growing more popular.  
This is heretical and far from the truth. It is not the real God but something else.  

Additionally, people are being taught that prayer is useless and that Holy Communion has no value.  
They are told, “You went to church, but it didn’t help. You’re still stuck, and your relatives are sick or dead. So, why bother praying? Focus on money instead—that will save you.”  
This mindset is spreading.  

Sin is also being facilitated.  
When locked down in their rooms, people turn to the internet for entertainment, often indulging in sinful behaviors.  
The devil finds it easier to break individuals one by one than to break families or churches.  
He finds a way to exploit each person’s weaknesses.  

Laziness is becoming widespread.  
People are growing accustomed to not working or working only minimally online, on their own schedules.  
They feel more powerful because they can push a button and have food delivered, avoiding the need to go out.  
This convenience is making them lazier, yet they feel more in control.  

Electronic money is prospering, seen as safer and more convenient.  
Cryptocurrencies, like mining, create money “out of nowhere.”  
In the secular world, money has become a substitute for grace—a source of pleasure and fulfillment.  
People no longer feel the need for grace; they find comfort in prosperity and material pleasures.  
But these are fake, coming from the devil, not from God.  

People are also being separated from nature.  
In nature, we feel the real world and often hear God’s voice.  
It provides spiritual help and support.  
But now, locked in rooms, people are broken and disconnected from this source of strength.  
Instead, they turn to their laptops and the internet for everything.  

The digital world is becoming increasingly dominant.  
Everything is being digitized, and this poses a danger.  
The digital realm can replace many human and spiritual aspects of life.  
Virtual reality is even more dangerous because it is not real.  
In the time of the Antichrist, people will live in virtual reality, further distancing themselves from truth and God.  

We must be aware of these trends and resist them.  
We must hold fast to our faith, gather as a church, and seek God’s grace rather than the false comforts of the world.  
Let us not be deceived by the illusions of convenience, digital dependency, or material substitutes for spiritual fulfillment.  
Instead, let us remain grounded in the truth and connected to one another as the body of Christ.

We can see from the Book of Revelation that the world is moving toward a more virtual existence.  
Machines will provide artificial pleasures, and people will believe they are experiencing reality—traveling, doing whatever they desire—but it will all be virtual.  
This trend already exists, but it will intensify as a result of the pandemic, the duration of which remains uncertain.  

As this happens, people will become increasingly disconnected from true knowledge.  
Genuine knowledge cannot be obtained solely from the internet.  
It requires real-life communication with professors and fellow students.  
Distance education is weak in comparison.  
Without discipline—such as the structure of being in a classroom at 8 a.m.—learning becomes fragmented and ineffective.  
This lack of discipline and connection will lead to a decline in education and knowledge, akin to slipping into a new dark age.  
The less knowledge people have, the easier they are to manipulate.  

We are witnessing these developments unfold daily.  
In response, we must become oases of different mindsets and ways of life.  
We must rely on Christ, drawing energy and revelation from Him.  
By doing so, we can help others overcome these challenges, remain strong, and avoid being broken or led astray.  
We must resist becoming enslaved by the emerging system—the so-called "new world order" that is being constructed.  

Let us stand firm, wise, and steadfast in our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  
May His grace and blessings be upon you. Amen.
