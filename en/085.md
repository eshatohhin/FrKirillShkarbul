# Orthodox Faith in Canada. Part 1.

Dear brothers and sisters, today I am recording this video in Toronto, Canada, and I want to talk about the Orthodox faith here in Canada. I was ordained as a priest in Edmonton at the Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church quite a few years ago and served in farm parishes in Alberta. The tradition of Orthodox testimony and mission is growing and developing. Today, we have more than 30 parishes just in Toronto alone. But how did the Church come to these lands? How did this happen? The earliest arrival of missionaries to North America was in 1794. It was a mission by the monks of Valaam Monastery in Russia, led by Saint Herman of Alaska. They arrived at the end of the 18th century in Alaska and preached to the local nations, the Aleut people, both in Alaska and on the Aleutian Islands. From that Orthodox stronghold, the faith spread across North America. We see accounts of Orthodox witness in Quebec as early as the 1860s and 1870s. Tsar Alexander II presented a reprinted copy of the Codex Sinaiticus in 1879 to a college in Lennoxville, Quebec, due to the strong cooperation between the college and the Orthodox Church. At the time, priests from New York would come and serve in those Orthodox communities. However, the first officially documented Divine Liturgy was held in a place called Vostok, Alberta, in June 1897. It is now June again, just as it was in June 1897, over 100 years ago—124 years ago, to be exact—when the first liturgy gathered 600 Orthodox faithful, already a significant number. These were farmers, Rusyn by nationality, essentially Russians from Western Ukraine, specifically the region of Galicia. They were skilled farmers, well-trained in crops, and they were pioneers, developing the vast valleys and forests of Canada in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, starting in the late 19th century. These people were deeply rooted in their faith and passed on the Orthodox tradition to their children. They also witnessed to other immigrants who came from all over the world. At that time, missionaries, primarily from Alaska, were active. In the 1860s, there were perhaps only six priests in all of North America, Canada, and the U.S., excluding Alaska, where there was already a strong Orthodox presence. Across the rest of North America, there were only a handful of priests, and even later, there were not enough to cover the vast distances between farms and communities. When I was serving in Alberta, there were 18 parishes that had to be served by just one priest. The priest had to travel to different farms and villages on a schedule, with a different church every Sunday. This required a strong missionary spirit, quite different from the traditional model where a town or village has one priest and one community, like a family. In Canada, it was different. This missionary spirit is the true essence of Christianity, reflecting the way the apostles traveled to many places. We need to cultivate this spirit, especially in the vast context of North America, where distances are immense, population density is low, and the number of people who believe in God is even smaller.

So there is a great need for active ministry and testimony about faith. In those days, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Orthodox parishes were all united under one jurisdiction, one family. It was called the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church under the jurisdiction of the Russian Church. That was its full name—one entity that embraced people of all nations: Arabs, Greeks, Russians, Ukrainians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Romanians. All of them were united together, as it should be. They were led by Saint Tikhon, who at the time was the Archbishop of New York. Later, he became the Patriarch of Russia during the Bolshevik era and the civil war in Soviet Russia. But earlier, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, he served here on American and Canadian soil. In one of the parishes I served in Alberta, there is still a letter preserved from the consecration of a small church, a farm parish chapel, that was signed by him. He wrote it as a blessing for this place in 1904, and they still preserve it. Nothing has changed. The descendants of those who established this church over 100 years ago are still there, still Orthodox, and still engaged in ministry and testimony about Christ and their faith. Let us pray for the mission in Canada, that God may send more ministers and priests to this area. In the following video, I will discuss the present situation of Orthodox mission and ministry here in Canada. May God bless every one of you. Amen.
