# Orthodox Christian Mission in Asia-Pacific

Dear friends, welcome to the mission channel of the Orthodox Christian Church in Taiwan.  
I'm Fr. Kirill Shkarbov, and we are now at the Exaltation of the Holy Cross Church in Taipei.  
If you are not yet Orthodox, you can learn more about the authentic faith of the Churchâ€”the Church of the Apostles, which has preserved the true faith in Christ for 2,000 years.  
We will talk about Orthodox spirituality and prayer. If you are already Orthodox, you can also learn how to become a stronger soldier of Christ and overcome evil both within and outside yourself in this world.  
We will discuss modern world issues in light of the Gospel.  
We will learn about prayer and how to avoid the deceptions of the evil that exists in this world.  
Let us be united. Let us pray for one another, for we need to be together, as Christ has instructed us.  
Let us learn together how to carry out mission work and bear witness to the Word of God in this world, with God's help and for His glory.  
May God bless you.
