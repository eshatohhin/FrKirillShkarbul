# Mission on Guam. Part 1

Dear brothers and sisters, I'm on a mission in Guam right now, thanks to COVID, because all of Asia is closed, and we cannot visit the mission in Papua New Guinea or the mission in East Timor due to quarantine and lockdowns. Guam is the only place I could go this year, which is why I decided to explore any mission opportunities here, to assess the situation and find any Orthodox Christians already present. That is the purpose of my visit.

As you may know, Guam is part of the United States, belonging to the U.S. as part of the Mariana Islands archipelago. The largest island is Guam, which is geographically in Asia but politically part of the United States. It is quite close to Taiwan, just a three-hour flight away, and is somewhat isolated, being a seven-and-a-half-hour flight from Hawaii. It lies in the middle of Oceania, near the Mariana Trench, the deepest trench in the world. This volcanic series of islands comprises over 100 islands, but only four are of significant size and population: Guam, Saipan (which I hope to visit in a couple of days), Rota, and Tinian. These four islands are the larger ones, and I hope to have the opportunity to start a mission on each of them during this trip.

Currently, in Guam, there are some Orthodox Christians who are Russian. I have already met with them. They are essentially stuck here due to visa issues, as some intended to go to the United States. We hope their problems will be resolved, but some may stay here permanently. If we can form a community here, it could serve as a starting point to introduce Orthodoxy to others. Ideally, this would create a place where everyone living in Guam, Saipan, and the other islands could come to learn about the Orthodox Church, pray, and discover more about the authentic faith of the apostles.

Historically, the Pacific region was first developed by Orthodox missionaries in the 18th century. Missionaries arrived in Hawaii at the end of the 18th century, and later, Saint Innocent of Moscow (Veniaminov) established a mission in the Aleutian Islands, located north of the Pacific near Alaska. Churches from that mission still exist today. In Hawaii, there is also the miracle-working Iveron Icon of the Mother of God. While the mission spread to this region, it did not reach Guam for quite some time. In fact, I am not aware of any Orthodox mission ever being conducted here. As they say, better late than never, so hopefully, we can begin this mission now. We have a strategy and priorities to develop it, and I will dedicate one of my later videos to discussing our mission here, our goals, and any successes we achieve. Please keep an eye out for that.

Today, I want to share a few words about Guam and its indigenous people, the Chamorro, who have lived here for thousands of years. The Chamorro are a Micronesian ethnicity with their own language. While most people on Guam speak or at least understand Chamorro, the younger generation tends to understand only some of it, whereas the older generation is fluent. On the less Americanized islands, even small children speak the language quite well. There is a growing movement to revive and promote the use of Chamorro, with some schools now teaching it. The Chamorro culture is rich and welcoming. Although the people are somewhat Americanized, their distinct character and cultural values remain strong. They are a different nation, with values that resonate deeply with Christian teachings.

For example, the concept of *mamalo* in the Chamorro language means to be shy or humble. As we know, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5). Humility is a cherished virtue among the Chamorro. Another important value is *inafa'maolek*, which means to do good or to make things right. This aligns closely with the Christian emphasis on kindness and righteousness. The Chamorro people are known for their respect—for others, for nature, and for life itself. Their culture is humble, peaceful, and deeply connected to the natural world, having coexisted with it for centuries. This makes Guam fertile ground for the Gospel.

Guam was under Spanish rule for about 400 years, which led to the widespread adoption of Catholicism. However, today, although most of the population identifies as Catholic, many no longer attend church or practice their faith. Disillusionment with religion has left room for various sects and cults to thrive. Yet, the people remain inherently religious, and I hope that the true faith—Orthodox Christianity—can take root here with God's help.

The population of Guam alone is around 170,000, which is twenty times larger than that of the Aleutian Islands. This makes Guam a significant priority for the Church's mission efforts. I sincerely hope that the Church will send a priest here permanently, as well as missionaries to develop the faith on Guam, Saipan, and the other islands.

The history of Guam is marked by sorrow. After Spanish rule, the island changed hands multiple times—American, German, Japanese, and eventually American again. During World War II, Guam and Saipan were the sites of fierce battles, resulting in immense loss of life. Many locals, influenced by propaganda, tragically jumped from cliffs, believing the Americans would kill them. The 20th century brought great pain and bloodshed to Guam, shaping a people who understand that life is not easy. Such hardships often prepare hearts for Christ, fostering humility, a search for truth, and a concern for eternal life and fundamental values.

I am hopeful that the mission here will succeed and that, in time, there will be many Chamorro Orthodox Christians, as well as Orthodox believers from other nations. Guam is home to a diverse population, including Americans, soldiers, Russians, and people from all over the world. Everyone here should have the opportunity to experience the Orthodox Church, to pray, and to witness Christ to others. May the Lord guide us on this path. Please pray for the Mariana Islands, for the mission here, and for all the Orthodox Christians in this region. Thank you very much, and God bless.
