# Why God allowed pandemic Will we have Dark Ages again

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to invite you to reflect on a significant issue. I will not provide straightforward answers; instead, I want all of us to contemplate where we stand as humankind.

This year, we have experienced—and are still experiencing—a pandemic. We have seen that many things we once took for granted, such as air travel and access to hospitals, have nearly disappeared. In many places, hospitals are overwhelmed, leaving people unable to receive proper medical care and forcing them to seek treatment at home. Similarly, education has been disrupted. We can see that things can deteriorate far beyond what we are accustomed to. This is not merely an economic cycle or even a depression; it may be something worse.

Most of us have not experienced events like the Great Depression, World War II, or any other global crisis of that magnitude. Today, we have the opportunity to reflect on what this means and where it might lead us.

Some people predict that things will worsen, suggesting that the current virus will pale in comparison to a potential computer virus that could collapse all systems. A future world war, if it were to occur, would be even more devastating. We can now at least imagine what such scenarios might look like—scenarios that affect everyone and are profoundly dire. I do not wish to frighten anyone, but I want us to consider these possibilities because Christ Himself spoke of various disasters and wars for a purpose.

The question arises: Is civilization, as we know it—with its advanced technology, communication, and economy—truly beneficial? Is it inherently good, or is that not necessarily the case? Often, people criticize the Church, claiming it is regressive, dragging us back to the Middle Ages, and that we need progress and modernity. However, this is not true. The Church advocates for human development in all its forms. It has always promoted education, literacy, and the sciences. The Orthodox Church, the Christian Church, has consistently supported technological advancement and research. The Church is not opposed to progress; in fact, it actively encourages it.

Yet, there are aspects of our civilized world that we must critically examine. For instance, as a missionary, I have observed that in developed countries—such as those in Europe, the Americas, and even Mexico—our efforts to spread the Gospel are often less effective. Fewer people are interested in discussing religion, prayer, eternal life, or the Kingdom of Heaven. Many are more focused on comfortable living, business, entertainment, and healthy lifestyles.

In contrast, when we visit developing countries like the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and parts of Africa, we encounter a significant number of people eager to listen to the Word of God. This is not because they seek financial gain—though that does occur—but because they are genuinely interested in faith. Despite having little to no material possessions, they are willing to invest time and resources in prayer, attending church, and participating in mission work. This is deeply encouraging.

We must ask ourselves: Why is this the case? What makes these individuals more open to religious and spiritual life? By exploring these questions, we can draw valuable insights.

Indeed, we can observe parallels between the present and the early days of the Church. Those who persecuted the Church were primarily the Romans, especially the educated, noble, and civilized elite—the intellectuals of their time. Similarly, among the Jews, it was often the more educated, such as the scribes, Pharisees, and priests, who opposed Christianity. These were the most civilized and learned individuals of their era. Why, then, was there such hostility toward the Christian message, the Gospel, the good news?

The Apostle Paul provides insight, warning that knowledge can lead to arrogance and pride. Those who consider themselves knowledgeable, developed, high-class, or educated often believe they have all the answers. They may resist the humility required to accept the Gospel. Of course, this is a broad generalization, but it highlights a danger inherent in education and societal advancement: the risk of pride and self-sufficiency. This pride can distance people from God, leaving no room for Him in their hearts.

This may also shed light on why God allows disasters—wars, revolutions, or societal collapses—to occur. When people become saturated with material comforts, achievements, and self-reliance, they often forget their need for God. This spiritual emptiness can lead to calamity, as humanity's moral and spiritual foundations erode. Such disasters serve as reminders, shaking us out of complacency and redirecting our focus to what truly matters.

However, this does not mean the Church promotes a return to barbarism or a lawless, anarchic existence. A life governed solely by base instincts and devoid of civilization is equally perilous. Without moral and spiritual guidance, humanity's sinful nature takes over, leading to cruelty, selfishness, and chaos. History and post-apocalyptic fiction alike depict such societies as brutal, where only the strong survive, and human life loses its value. The Church does not advocate for this kind of existence.

Instead, we must ask: Is a civilization devoid of spirituality, God, and moral values better or worse than barbarism? I believe it is worse. A godless yet technologically advanced society is akin to giving a nuclear bomb to a madman or a knife to a child—it is a recipe for disaster. Without God, humanity misuses its advancements, exploiting others, fostering selfishness, and creating a fragmented, atomized society. Such a civilization becomes prideful and arrogant, blind to its own moral decay.

This is why the Church warns against the dangers of a godless, morally bankrupt civilization. It is not progress or development that is inherently evil, but the absence of spiritual and ethical foundations. A society that prioritizes material gain over moral integrity risks self-destruction. The disasters we face—whether pandemics, wars, or societal collapses—are not God's will, but they may be permitted as a consequence of our collective choices. If we fail to change, both individually and as a society, these crises will persist and worsen.

Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for whatever may come. Above all, we must remain steadfast in our faith, walking with Christ. With Him, we need not fear any disaster. We must seek His wisdom and guidance, learning from the lessons of the past. Only by grounding ourselves in faith and humility can we navigate the challenges of our time and build a civilization that honors both God and humanity.

We must use this pandemic as a lesson to reflect deeply on who we are, where we are headed, and what we can do to prevent things from worsening. Let us turn to the Lord, asking Him to grant us wisdom and love, so that we may pray more fervently and dedicate ourselves more fully to serving Him. He calls us to deepen our spiritual lives and to put greater effort into living according to His will.

May God help us and guide us, preserving our civilization and enabling us to achieve higher levels of economic, social, and moral development. May He bless each one of you and grant us the strength and faith to navigate these challenging times. Amen.
