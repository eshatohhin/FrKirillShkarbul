# Ascension of the Lord - Are we still waiting for the Second Coming

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen! We have arrived at the end of the 40-day period during which the resurrected Christ appeared to His disciples and taught them the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. However, it seems they did not fully understand everything, as we can see from the Bible. Let us examine how the ascension occurred, and then we will discuss its significance for the Church today and how relevant it is for us.

Let us turn to Acts 1:6-11:  
*"When they (the disciples) had come together, they asked Him, 'Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?' And He said to them, 'It is not for you to know the times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.' Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.'"*

First, a clarification: the English translation often states that Jesus "was taken up," but this is not entirely accurate. The original Greek and Syriac texts, particularly the oldest Syriac manuscripts, use an active form, indicating that He ascended Himself. This is an important distinction. Many translations make this error, though some correctly render it as "He ascended."

Now, let us examine this passage more closely. The disciples asked, "Will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" This was their primary concern. Despite spending 40 days with the risen Christ, they still did not fully grasp His teachings. They gathered together, about 500 disciples—those who were connected to the Lord, cared about His mission, and had faith in Him. This group of 500 represented the fruit of Jesus' ministry and the efforts of His disciples throughout Judea and Galilee. Though Jesus had fed 5,000 (or even more), only these 500 remained faithful and gathered to witness His ascension.

The disciples asked, "Is this the fulfillment of what we have been waiting for? Is this the restoration promised by the prophets?" Jesus replied, "No, the times and seasons are under the authority of God the Father. It is not for you to know these things. Instead, focus on the mission I am giving you: to be My witnesses, proclaiming My resurrection, teachings, love, and sacrifice. You will carry this message to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. For now, return to Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Spirit, who will empower you for this task."

Jesus redirected their expectations. Instead of anticipating an earthly kingdom of Israel, they were to await the coming of the Holy Spirit and the promise of His return. This was their new focus. As Jesus ascended, a cloud enveloped Him, and the disciples stood gazing into the sky. Two angels appeared and said, "Why do you stand looking into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you, will return in the same way."

Sometimes, we may think the purpose of faith is simply to pray, contemplate, and experience Heaven. However, Jesus' ascension reminds us that our mission is active and outward-focused. We are called to be His witnesses, empowered by the Holy Spirit, until He returns. This is the relevance of the ascension for us today: it calls us to live with purpose, sharing the Gospel and anticipating His glorious return.

In the divine service, it is not enough to remain in a state of prayer alone. While prayer is essential, it is also a means to receive the commission to go forth and carry out the work of the Lord until He returns. The Messiah has accomplished everything necessary for all to participate in the celebration, in this divine symposium, this banquet He has prepared for us. The fullness and completion of this will occur at His second coming. Thus, there is a gap—a period between His first ascension and His second coming. We live in this gap, which is why it is referred to as the "latter times" or the "last times." This era spans from His first ascension to His second coming.

During this time, the two angels appeared and delivered a message directly from the Lord. Angels do not speak on their own; they convey only what they receive from God. Their message was clear: "Why do you stand gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven." His second coming will be similar—on the clouds, on the final day of this world, the day of the great judgment. On that day, all will be resurrected, and those still alive will be transformed. All nations will gather to face this final judgment. 

The notion of a "rapture" or a millennium of earthly happiness with Jesus is a heresy. We await the second coming of the Lord, the end of this age, and the establishment of the new heaven and new earth. While the exact nature of this new reality remains a mystery, we know it will come to pass.

Now, let us consider the disciples. After the ascension, Jesus instructed them to wait in Jerusalem for ten days. They were to remain there until the feast of Pentecost (Shavuot), when many would gather. They did not return to Galilee but stayed together in one house, praying fervently. The most holy Theotokos, the Mother of God, was with them, as were others, including Mary, the mother of Jesus. They prayed intensely, perhaps throughout the day, for one purpose: to receive the Holy Spirit. This was their primary petition, their deepest longing—to see the Lord's promise fulfilled.

This raises a question for us: How many of us pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit? How many make this the central focus of our prayers? Not many, I fear. Yet, without the Holy Spirit, we are not truly Christians, nor are we Orthodox. We may call ourselves whatever we like, but unless the Holy Spirit dwells within us, guiding, enlightening, and giving us life, we are not disciples of Christ. This is why the early disciples prayed so fervently—to be worthy and capable of the mission entrusted to them.

The New Testament, the new covenant between God and humanity, is established at Pentecost through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. If we do not have the Holy Spirit, we are outside this covenant. This is of utmost importance. The Holy Spirit is not a mere fantasy, nor is it about stirring up emotions or indulging in the delusions promoted by many sects. No, the Holy Spirit is love, meekness of heart, faithfulness to Christ, bearing witness to Him, and sacrificing ourselves for His sake and for others. These are the marks of the true Holy Spirit. It is about the transformation of our hearts and our commitment to serving Him and His people. 

Let us, therefore, pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit, that we may be filled with His presence and empowered to fulfill the mission Christ has given us. This is the essence of our faith and the foundation of our life in Christ.

The asceticism of the saints, their willingness to endure hardship and toil, stems from their deep craving for the Holy Spirit. They sought to mortify the flesh so that they might receive the Holy Spirit and be empowered to fulfill the Lord's will. All heresies, schisms, worldliness within the Church, and spiritual sicknesses arise from a lack of the Holy Spirit. This deficiency comes from people's departure from the path of communion with God, as they become entangled in worldly concerns.

The Church awaits Christ's second coming. In the early days, the disciples would gather annually on the Mount of Olives, gazing into the sky, praying, and expecting His return. For them, it was clear that He would come soon. However, "soon" in human terms differs from "soon" in God's timing. He did not return in their lifetime. Decades passed, Jerusalem was destroyed, the Church was dispersed, and most of the early disciples died. Centuries turned into millennia, and the temptation arose to think, "He is not coming in my lifetime, so why should I care?" This mindset leads us to focus on other things, losing sight of the mission entrusted to us by Christ. When we no longer anticipate His coming, we sever our connection with the disciples who received this mission. We cease to be true Christians.

For us, the proper worldview is this: Christ's first coming, His second coming, and the great task we have in between. Though He is physically absent, He remains present in the Church, unseen by the world but a reality we witness and proclaim. The world, however, has seduced many into a delusion: that God, the Creator, established natural laws but does not intervene in our lives. According to this view, our task is simply to live according to these laws, creating a dualistic separation between the divine and the human. Others fall into pantheism, equating God with nature, leading to New Age movements, occultism, and paganism, which often devolve into satanism by justifying evil as a means to good.

The Holy Spirit, however, reverses the division of Babel. This will be explored further in the context of Pentecost, which stands in stark contrast to the false unity of ecumenism—a modern-day Babel. The problems within the Church today, such as Orthodox killing Orthodox or priests blessing such actions for political, nationalistic, or imperialistic goals, stem from a loss of focus on Christ's return and the mission He entrusted to us. We have been brainwashed by worldly ideologies, becoming deists rather than Christians. We misunderstand the gap between Christ's ascension and His return, treating it as a separation between two worlds. This leads to worldliness, where people support evil lies, believing them to be truth, and in the name of God, they commit the works of the devil.

To reclaim our identity as Christians, we must recenter our lives on the expectation of Christ's return and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Only then can we fulfill our mission, bear witness to His truth, and resist the seductions of the world. Let us pray fervently for the Holy Spirit, that we may be guided, enlightened, and empowered to live as true disciples of Christ, awaiting His glorious return.

Let us detach ourselves from the delusions of this world, especially during these sacred days and always. Let us pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit to descend upon us, to fill our hearts, guide us, and grant us meekness of heart and selfless, sacrificial love—love for our neighbors and even for our enemies, if we have any. Let us abandon all agendas that are not motivated by the Lord, that lack truth, and that are rooted in falsehood and sin.

May the Lord grant us His grace. May He send down His Holy Spirit upon each of us. A blessed Ascension of the Lord to you all! We will celebrate this feast for eight days, beginning this Thursday (or Wednesday night) and continuing through the following Thursday. May the Lord bless you, and may His grace be with you. Amen. Christ is with you!
