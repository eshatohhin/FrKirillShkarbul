# Why the Lord does not immediately punish evil doers

Dear brothers and sisters, we look at the modern world, and it seems that the Lord has departed from this world. We see that in the Old Testament, the Jews were sinning, worshipping false gods, and then there was the judgment of the Lord. Calamities came, they repented, and things got better. Even when they rejected Christ, soon Jerusalem was destroyed, the Temple was destroyed, and all the Jews were dispersed. This was the manifestation of the Lord's wrath upon the former people of God. Similar things happened later in Church history when people turned away.

But recently, it seems that there is no such correlation. There is more and more evil in this world, and there is no clear retribution, better to say, coming from the Lord. Actually, we see in the Psalms that the evildoers, the wicked, or the ungodly will be punished severely, even in this life. For example, we look at Psalm 1, verse 4: "The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away." Okay, Psalm 37, verse 10: "For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be." And many other places, such as the idea that the man of blood and wickedness will not live to half his days. In many other places in the Testament, we see that this tribulation is imminent; it's coming.

And now we see those politicians who destroyed millions of people, for example, in Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and many other places. Those politicians live for over a hundred years, and everywhere—whether in capitalist, socialist, or communist countries—most of those big butchers, those murderers, live on, and nothing happens to them. The whole world is going in some ungodly, crazy direction in terms of lifestyle and thinking. Just consider people in the past: it was normal to understand that living with someone without marriage was adultery. But now, no—there is no adultery, there is no sin. Just do what you want, with anyone you like. This is just a small example. There are many, many more examples of how the world is growing increasingly chaotic these days, and nothing really happens.

Yes, there are some floods, but usually, they happen in countries that are not so perverse. They often occur in places like Southeast Asia, where there is still some concept of family, or in South America. They usually don't happen in countries that are now the propagators of this Babylon, of these post-Christian, post-modern values—if you can even call them values—garbage values. Why does this happen? Why is the Lord not punishing this? Why is He not stopping this from happening? As a result, many people lose faith and say, "The Lord has abandoned this world. Where is He?"

I recently visited some Western countries, and the churches are empty. You find exhibition rooms, condominiums, clubs, and other things in the churches, but no one is willing to pray there. These are old churches, historical churches, but now they are completely refurbished inside. The population in those towns is about ten times larger than it used to be, but the number of churches remains the same as it was 100 years ago. With ten times more people living there, they don't need these churches—even those that are already built. People don't need them.

All of this tells us that the spiritual state of modern humanity has degraded greatly. Not many people are willing to follow Christ now—much worse than it used to be. It was always a small number, but now it seems to be truly dire. At the same time, we see a great revival of all kinds of sects: New Age, yoga, Buddhism, neo-Buddhism, neo-Hinduism, fetishism, paganism, astrology, and all sorts of superstitions that are now welcomed and propagated. What has happened? What is going on? And where is the Lord? Our question is: Where is the Lord in all this mess?

To understand this—or to try to understand it—we need to look at the times that were prophetic for what is happening now. I am referring to the period after the resurrection of Christ until the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem. The slaughter of perhaps over a million Jews at that time, and the enslavement of the rest, was prophetic for what will happen at the end of the world. Of course, there are other prophetic times, such as the times of Noah and the flood, or later during the Justinian plague. But today, let us focus on the time of the apostles after the resurrection.

We can see that the Jews committed a great sin. They listened to the Lord for three years, yet they rejected Him and sought a different lord—the Antichrist. That is why they destroyed Him. Even though they committed such a grave sin and had a clear understanding of what they were doing, they were given 40 years until the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. Why is this so? The Holy Fathers tell us that the Lord, in His longsuffering, waited for their repentance for 40 long years. During this time, He did not punish them directly for what they had done. However, the longer the Lord waited, the harder their hearts became, and the more steadfast they grew in their evil deeds.

We can imagine that some of them did repent. We know that after Peter’s sermons in Jerusalem, there were two significant moments when thousands converted—5,000 and then 3,000. Even some of the leaders converted. However, the majority did not. Moreover, the Lord allowed these Jews to persecute the Church. For the first 40 years, there was great persecution, primarily instigated by the Jews, including the massive persecutions in Rome, where thousands of Christians were burned alive. These persecutions were often incited by the Jews. Of course, I am not being anti-Semitic, nor am I blaming all Jews for this. I am speaking of what happened historically, particularly among those Jews who were responsible. There were also holy Jews who became disciples of Christ.

So, what is happening now? The Lord is watching everything that is going on. He knows the heart of every human soul, and He is allowing this time for evil to manifest itself to the fullest extent. If people choose to pursue evil, He permits it. The times we live in now are of utmost importance in the eyes of the Lord. He wants the faith of Christians to be crystallized and purified, like gold refined by fire. We must be purified through the temptations, hardships, and seductions that come from the Antichrist, as well as the delusions, heresies, ecumenism, and all the other garbage that surrounds us. We must become stronger and firmer in our faith and dedication to the Lord. By enduring these trials, we can reach salvation.

And at the same time, the Lord allows this so that all those who reject Him will have no excuses, saying, "We didn’t have enough time," or, "We thought we were doing the right thing. Maybe if we had more time, we would repent or understand what was going on." No, He wants them to go to the very end. There is a concept in the Bible that we see quite often: the measure of the Lord’s longsuffering—or, better to say, the measure of sin—can be fulfilled. If it is not yet fulfilled, the Lord waits. But once it is fulfilled, judgment comes immediately. 

We can say that the world has not yet reached that point of no return, that final point of destruction. But we are approaching it. This day is coming, and we must put all our effort into strengthening our faith and bearing witness to our Lord. In Revelation, chapter 13, verse 10, and chapter 14, verse 12, we read, for example, in 14:12, "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." I am paraphrasing it in my own words. 

Who are the saints? They are those who keep the commandments of God and maintain their faith in Jesus. If we want to be among those saints, we must keep the Lord’s commandments every day of our lives and place our full trust and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. This faith must be true faith, rooted in Holy Communion and union with the body and blood of Jesus Christ—a union rejected by all heresies. 

May the Lord grant us this faith and the gift of loving Him. May He help us avoid all delusions, temptations, and selfishness, and bring victory to His glory. May the Lord be with all of you. Amen.
