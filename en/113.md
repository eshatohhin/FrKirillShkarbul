# QR-codes = digital slavery

Dear brothers and sisters, this week one subscriber asked me about QR codes. It's getting more and more of them, especially with this COVID agenda. I'm recording this video not because I think it's important. I think QR codes themselves are not that important. But we can see, even in minor things, if we look at them from a spiritual point of view, we can see some important aspects. This whole topic will be related to the digital era and digitalization. There is digiphobia, which is quite common among faithful people in the church. I've recorded a couple of videos about it, but today I will say a little bit more about how QR codes are similar and how they are different from other things that we have.

Well, first of all, I can say that my own attitude towards this is that I'm not afraid of the QR code itself. A few years ago, we already had this brochure to give out. There is also one at the entrance to the church. You can see there are QR codes here. These are QR codes for Facebook that you can easily scan and go into the Facebook page of the parish, which is another digital thing. But at the same time, I also said that if you ask me to have a QR code that will be absolutely necessary for people to come into the church, or if you say people have to have a QR code to enter the church, I will not allow this to happen. You can crucify me here on this iconostasis, but I will not allow this to happen. This is going beyond the line that I drew.

And why such a different approach? Aren't they all QR codes? Well, I can talk about four different applications or areas of use of QR codes, and my attitude is different in each area. Before talking about that, I want to say something about digitalization and digiphobia. We have had many problems with this. Some people are not willing to have a passport, and then they get detained in some country. They cannot go anywhere because they don't have a passport. They are stuck. They go to prison. There are people who are afraid of barcodes. For example, this marker has a barcode. The person would look: does it have one? When we ask him to write something, if there is a barcode, no, he won't use it. He's afraid of the saying, "It's the mark of the beast," and things like that. That is sick. We have a saying in Russian: ask a stupid, dumb person to pray, and he will break his head. He will be hitting the floor, bowing, and he'll break his head. Basically, we are all dumb. We are all stupid. That may be a surprise for you, but in some respects, every one of us is stupid, and every one of us is a sinner, even though we think that we are fine, that we are perfect.

So, this is one thing. I'm against this digiphobia. I think this is sick. But to be careful, to be thoughtful about things related to this digitalization, is a wise approach. Because when you give a knife to a child, you'll think twice before doing that. Maybe he'll cut himself or somebody. When you give guns to former criminals, and even to the general public, you will do all kinds of research on that person to see if he's alright to have a gun. Even in a country, you will think twice before giving this country a nuclear weapon. Usually, you don't give it to anyone, not because you don't want to, but because it's dangerous for the world. So, it doesn't mean that a gun is something from the devil. We cannot use any technology for that matter because it can hurt you. Then we would not even use stones because we can hit somebody with a stone. So, we need to be knowledgeable about this. We're not techno-pessimists. There are people who are against progress, any kind of technical progress. We're not against it. We should not be against it. But we need to know that any technology will lead a sinner to a greater sin. If somebody had a sin of "I want to buy many things," let's say, shopping, shopaholic, and you give him a credit card, of course, he'll buy even more.

And he'll get stuck. His whole life may be ruined because you gave him this credit card, this ability. His sin, his passion, will harm him even more, his family, and maybe his life will be destroyed. So, some kind of sin, some kind of virus, is in every one of us. Sin is like a thief. It comes, it breaks in, and it conquers you in some way. From Adam and Eve, when they committed the first sin, that's when Satan came and broke in. They lost their contact with God, this direct union with Him in love. They lost immortality. They lost paradise. They lost many things as a result of this sin coming in. And these kinds of viruses come into us, and we have a whole bunch of them. That's why many people are fat—at some point, this addiction became too strong. Many people are lonely. That's also some kind of situation that made them depressed, lonely. Nervous disorders, some neurological issues, some thoughts—these always come. Even the reliance on music—people always have to have music to listen to. Of course, drinking, drugs, social media—you always have to go on Facebook, check everything, stuff like that. Games, computer games—everyone has a different kind of brokenness, this breach that happened.

Husband and wife also help each other because they're broken in different ways. The husband wants to drink a lot, and the wife tells him, "Don't do it." But the wife wants to buy too many things, and the husband tells her, "No, don't do it." And they help each other to overcome these things. It's just an example, of course. The internet makes you addicted. This is another picture. The devil is willing to accomplish two tasks. He is willing to break in, to have an easier way to break in. And what does he do to break in? Let's read Mark chapter 3, verse 27. The Lord said that no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, take away, or steal, unless he first binds the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house. This is also in Matthew. So, this is the goal. He is willing to bind us first. This is the first thing Satan wants to do—to be able to attack and to plunder, to take things from us, to make us weaker. All those viruses that come in, they are binding us, making us weaker and weaker. And then the second task that he has is to control, to preserve this situation as long as possible. He broke in, and he wants this to remain that way. He doesn't want you to recover from that sickness.

So, this digital stuff is helping the devil in this way, possibly. For example, you want to seduce somebody. Let's say we think like demons. You want to seduce somebody, but you can't just tell them to go do this thing because they won't do it. But you can create a situation that will make it easier for them to do it. For example, you give them a lot of money. And you know that they have some weaknesses. If you tell them to go do it, they won't, because they know that you know, and they have a conscience. But when they have this money, at some point, they will say, "Oh, I have money, I have everything, I'll go do it." There will be a fluctuation in their mood. At some point, they feel lonely, and they go and do things—things they would not do otherwise in another circumstance. So, this is the strategy of the devil also. All of this digital stuff that we have—I've already talked about credit cards and different things—because how are QR codes different? Well, they have those abilities. You can pay with a QR code. You can also have digital money to pay with a credit card. You are controlled, where you are, and you are traced and tracked through your QR code system. But you can also be traced and tracked through your cell phone. So, that was already there. You can do authentication. Did you know which websites you go to and which things you like? But you could do it without a QR code. They could do it if they wanted to.

The roots. I forgot to mention the roots of these fears. The basic root, of course, is that there are some people out there—maybe Satanists, fascists, occultists, capitalists, or some really bad individuals—who control the whole world, and they know everything about you. Where you go, what you do, how they educate you, how they brainwash you, how they manipulate everything about you. That's the main fear. Another fear is that this QR code has some magical power from Satan or something, and you are defiled or controlled spiritually through receiving this power that is in the code. I’ve already said that for a Christian, this is nothing. We don’t worry about this. Even if Satan himself wrote this QR code for you, saying, "Satan, Satan, you belong to me," and he gave this thing to you, it doesn’t matter to us. As long as we are with Christ, we are fine. We just use it for our purposes. If Satan made this QR code, we say, "Thank you, Satan. I’ll use it for my goals." So, we don’t care about that fear. But the other one—we do care.

Now, barcodes. We used to have barcodes for products, for scanning, and for passing through certain places. The QR code isn’t that much different. It’s just using more of those things combined. So, what might be the problem with QR codes? Let me talk about four situations that I think are quite different, even though they are interrelated—areas of using QR codes. 

The first one is relatively safe: when we need to scan a QR code to visit a website or pay for something, like an account or a service. It’s very convenient. You don’t need to fill in all that information or type out a website address. It saves you time and energy. That’s a good thing. But there’s also the issue of becoming lazy. That’s the same with any technology. You have a dishwasher, and you become lazy to wash dishes because you rely on the machine. It’s not a huge problem, but if, for example, you don’t know how to cook because you just push a button or order food, and everything is brought to you, that’s not ideal. Any technology that makes you more reliant on something has both good and bad sides. But if you feel something is really important, you can still say, "No, I want to learn how to cook," and you can become a good cook. So, I don’t think it’s a massive problem, though on a general scale, it’s making humanity more relaxed, lazy, weak, and less skilled. That’s one thing—relatively safe.

The second area is where I start to feel worried. We should avoid this as much as we can, but sometimes we can’t, and then we just need to be careful. These QR codes are with us, and maybe in the future, they will develop into something more advanced. Eventually, they might evolve into the "mark of the beast" mentioned in scripture—something placed on the hand or forehead. The same goes for credit cards—they’re also a kind of pre-mark of the beast. But this isn’t the mark of the beast yet, of course, and we shouldn’t be afraid of it by itself. The area that worries me is how QR codes help gather all kinds of information about you: where you go, what you like, who you meet, your location, your biometric data, and everything else. It’s easier to collect all that information using the QR code system. It can even be used to educate or manipulate you. For example, when you search on Google, it doesn’t show you everything—it shows you what it thinks you should see, based on algorithms. It’s guiding you, subtly shaping your thoughts and actions. That’s where the danger lies.

This artificial intelligence, which operates through algorithms—I’ve also talked about this—will at some point fall into the hands of the Antichrist, perhaps in the future. It will enable total control, giving them complete information dominance. I think it’s a bit too much to hand over all our information to a central data collection system. The third concern, sometimes referred to as an "electronic concentration camp," is that you are electronically hooked, monitored, and controlled. This system is training people to accept having their own mark—a unique identifier that grants permissions, sanctions, and access to everything. Over time, this mark will become attached to you in some way. It’s conditioning people to accept constant supervision, with no privacy and full control over their lives. When everyone becomes accustomed to this, it paves the way for the Antichrist to emerge. This is another area of concern. Whenever QR codes are tied to such systems, I would try to avoid them as much as possible.

The fourth area is one I would outright reject. I would not allow anything related to QR codes to infringe on fundamental freedoms. For example, closing churches or denying entry to people without a QR code is outright Antichristian. It’s a policy we must oppose at all costs. Similarly, forcing people to undergo vaccinations or other medical procedures under the threat of withholding a QR code is an infringement on personal freedom. If something is universally agreed upon by all doctors and experts as necessary, then perhaps it can be mandated. But if it’s questionable or pushed by a minority without democratic consensus, it cannot be forced on anyone. Additionally, if a QR code system hinders mission work—preventing me from meeting people, traveling, or spreading the Gospel—that is also Antichristian. I would do everything in my power to resist and dismantle such a system, as it may very well be a tool of the Antichrist.

These are the four areas, and each requires a different approach and attitude. We must be wise, rely on Christ, and rid ourselves of all spiritual viruses. QR codes can act as traps, making us reliant on them and ensnaring us in sin. To avoid being caught, we must fight not against the QR codes themselves but against our sins and passions. We must learn to live with Christ. Let us ask for His help and salvation, for salvation comes from Him alone—not from codes, vaccines, or advanced technologies. These things may be helpful or harmful, but true salvation comes from the Lord. We need His guidance, His wisdom, and His living power of resurrection to be with us, to strengthen us, and to lead us. Amen.

May the Lord help you and bless you. Amen.
