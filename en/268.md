# “The Mystery of Lawlessness” is expanding.

Dear brothers and sisters, many people have been asking me about what is happening in this world—wars escalating, the risk of larger conflicts, and other crises, whether economic, political, or otherwise. I am not a politician, nor am I an economic analyst. However, as Christians, we live in this world, though we do not belong to it. We must guard against worldliness and the spirit of this age, which seeks to draw everyone's attention to its own agenda. Yet, we cannot ignore what is happening, especially as clergy and pastors of the church. We cannot simply say, "Just pray and read the Bible," because people are hurting. They have worries and concerns about real-life issues—what is happening now and what may come. Therefore, we cannot turn a blind eye to these matters. For this reason, I decided to record this video to share some of my thoughts on the spiritual meaning behind these events and what we should do.

Recently, just last week, the war between Russia and Ukraine escalated further. Ukraine has now reclaimed parts of Russian-occupied territory, making the situation even more chaotic. This war is becoming increasingly dangerous and harmful, not only for the nations involved but also for the church and its mission. Both countries have significant Orthodox populations, but we must not assume that these nations are Orthodox in their governance or the majority of their people. Perhaps only 3-5% of the population are truly committed to the church. This is something I will address later.

First, let us examine the state of the world and what is happening globally before turning our attention to ourselves. It is evident that the world is descending into chaos. Many countries are currently engaged in direct warfare, and the number of such nations is increasing. Thousands of lives are lost daily, and millions are affected—displaced, their families torn apart, their futures destroyed. They have lost everything, including hope, and some have even lost faith in the Lord. Other countries may not be as directly impacted, but if you are fortunate enough not to have bombs falling on your head, praise the Lord. Still, you likely feel the tension gripping the world. There is a palpable sense of unease.

In the United States and the Western world, many are anxious about upcoming elections, internal divisions, the erosion of democracy, economic troubles, trade wars with China, and the looming threat of a third world war that so many are discussing. There is talk of a "great reset," potential future pandemics, social unrest, refugee crises, and political strife in Europe and beyond. In the Middle East, the crisis continues, with the possible involvement of Lebanon, Iran, and others. Even in relatively peaceful regions, there is widespread turmoil and danger for most of the global population. This deterioration has been ongoing since at least the 2008 economic crisis or the 2011 war in Syria, and it continues to worsen. I will later discuss the Apodion, the destroyer, the spirit behind this chaos—how it operates and how it is driving these events.

The second point I want to address is the blindness that has overtaken so many people. Most individuals today place their trust in bloggers or align themselves with a particular political stance. They are entrenched in a specific narrative, often brainwashed by it. For example, some believe that the greatest danger comes from Putin, viewing him as the ultimate villain. Others argue that the real threat lies with NATO and the United States, casting them as the antagonists. This polarization and division are part of the broader spiritual battle we face.

And you believe some narrative, some propaganda—let’s call it what it is. But you think it’s your own opinion, and everyone else is the same. Almost everyone you meet today is listening to some kind of blogger, subscribing to a particular mindset—left, right, pro-this, or anti-that. It’s almost impossible to have a meaningful conversation with them unless you share their views. This phenomenon is widespread in our time. You can see it in the people around you. They are blinded, like zombies, incapable of independent thought. They are influenced by others, yet they believe these are their own opinions. They are part of a swarm, like flies or drones all flying in the same direction. Or like the herd of swine in the Gospel, where 2,000 pigs rushed off a cliff and drowned in the sea. This is what is happening in the world today. Let us not become part of this spirit of the world.

The third issue we see is the profound crisis within the church. The church is the most evident manifestation of the mystery of piety. There is the mystery of lawlessness and the mystery of piety, and they are in constant conflict. The mystery of piety is that God became man and established the holy church so that people could receive the kingdom of heaven, become children of their Heavenly Father, and have the kingdom of heaven live within them, transforming them. This is the presence of God in the world—direct, physical, and incarnate. The body of Christ, which is the church, reveals the mystery of piety. Yet, we see that this is in crisis, and the situation is worsening. Since 2018, there has been a significant split within the Orthodox Church, the true church, and this division is not a healthy sign. Additionally, there is the problem of politicizing the church, using it to advance national agendas or even blessing wars as though they are sacred, reminiscent of the Jewish wars for the promised land. The Lord never blessed such things. These issues—divisions, wars, and worldliness within the church—are causing many to stumble. It has become a scandal, leading people to leave the church. There are two reasons for this: one is the poor example set by the church, and the other is people’s increasing attachment to worldly things, to mammon. I see this clearly. For example, we have many channels where I share information about the church, spiritual life, and prayer meetings—nothing political. Yet, some are losing interest because they are consumed by worldly concerns. They no longer care about what is divine, about prayer, or repentance. The devil is pulling people’s hearts away from the body of Christ.

The fourth issue is that society, including Christians, is becoming increasingly pitiless. The moral boundaries that once restrained us are being removed. People now speak openly about things that were once unthinkable—mass murder, the use of atomic weapons, or other cruel acts. They justify it by saying, “It’s war,” or “They’re the bad guys, so we can do whatever it takes.” This hatred and lack of compassion are growing, fueled by the movies people watch, the games they play, and the news they consume. These influences are desensitizing people, eroding their capacity for empathy and mercy. This is a dangerous trend, and as Christians, we must resist it. We are called to be salt and light in the world, to reflect God’s love and compassion, even in the face of evil. Let us not be swept away by the spirit of this age but remain steadfast in our faith and commitment to Christ.

These are the four key points I wanted to highlight about the state of the world. Now, what is behind all of this? Some people attribute it to rulers, conspiracies, or specific individuals like Putin or other "bad guys." Others argue that it’s because people are sinners, and as a result, we are slipping into chaos. Both perspectives hold truth. The reality is that there are few genuine Christians in positions of power, and even among the general population, many who claim to be Christians are weak in their faith. This lack of strong, faithful leadership and widespread spiritual apathy allows the mystery of lawlessness to expand. Behind this is not merely some secret world government—though such entities may exist—but rather the spirit of Apollyon. 

The name "Apollyon" comes from the Greek verb *apolio*, meaning to destroy or annihilate. Apollyon is the destroyer, the annihilator, the one who demolishes not only lives but also the souls of people. He drags humanity into the abyss of apostasy, sin, and lawlessness, breaking all boundaries and restrictions. This is his nature—he thrives on chaos and destruction. The four issues I mentioned earlier—escalating wars, societal blindness, the crisis within the church, and growing pitilessness—are all manifestations of this spirit. They represent the breaking of moral, spiritual, and societal boundaries. 

For example, the recent expansion of the war into Russian territory is unprecedented since World War II. This is another example of boundaries being crossed, of lawlessness spreading like a cancer. Whether it’s Russia invading Ukraine or Ukraine reclaiming territory, the area of conflict and lawlessness is expanding. This is the domain of the Antichrist, a spiritual cancer spreading across the world. 

However, let us not be deceived into thinking that Apollyon or the devil is all-powerful. He is not God. We, as Christians loyal to Christ, must despise him, mock him, and laugh at his works. The devil is nothing to us. We should not fear him or his schemes, but we must remain vigilant and aware of what is happening. Ignorance is not an option. We must be brave, informed, and spiritually alert, avoiding naivety or a rosy view of the world. At the same time, we must not deify evil or give the devil more power than he deserves. He is garbage, and we must treat him as such. 

Now, let’s turn our attention to ourselves. Each of us is slipping into routines, busyness, and distractions. By "routine," I mean being consumed by agendas from morning to night—work, household responsibilities, entertainment, or even idleness. We are always running, always chasing something, but rarely stopping to reflect on our lives, our relationship with God, or our need for prayer and repentance. This constant busyness or slothfulness makes time fly by, leaving us spiritually empty. 

It is crucial to pause, even for just five or ten minutes, to reflect on our lives, to pray, and to repent. These moments of stillness and connection with God are fundamental. Without them, we risk being swept away by the spirit of this age, losing sight of our true purpose as Christians. Let us not allow the distractions of this world to pull us away from the Lord. Instead, let us remain steadfast, vigilant, and rooted in our faith, knowing that Christ has already overcome the world.

The direction of our lives can shift dramatically when we pause to reflect deeply on who we are and where we are headed. This is why practicing spiritual life and prayer is so essential. It teaches us how to find stillness in a world that is always rushing, always chasing the next thing. In these chaotic times, having peace in our souls and maintaining an eternal spiritual dimension in our lives is absolutely critical. Without it, we risk being swept away by the noise and distractions of this world.

Another significant challenge we face is the constant bombardment of information—news, social media, chats, and endless conversations. We are constantly plugged into platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube, listening to bloggers and influencers who often lack spiritual and psychological stability. Many of these individuals are spiritually and morally degenerate, and their influence can distort our own thinking and emotions. This flood of information and the passions it stirs blinds us spiritually, leaving our inner lives in chaos. Our hearts and minds become overwhelmed, and we lose sight of what truly matters.

This is why fasting and spiritual discipline are so important. Fasting helps us detach from the noise and refocus on what is eternal. If you find your heart unsettled, turn to prayer—especially the Jesus Prayer—and separate yourself from the turmoil of the world. Calm your mind and soul, and seek the peace that only God can provide. We must be mindful of what we allow into our hearts and minds, for these influences shape us more than we realize.

The spirit of Apollyon, the destroyer, is cunning and strategic. He operates gradually, not rushing his plans, because he knows that slow, steady corruption is harder to resist. The recent escalation of war in Russia and Ukraine is just one example of his methodical approach. He seeks to expand chaos and lawlessness over the long term, like a cancer spreading through the body. But we must remember that the real battle is not in Ukraine, Russia, or Israel—it is in our hearts. Apollyon’s ultimate goal is to conquer our hearts, especially those of Orthodox Christians or anyone on the path to Christ. If he succeeds in breaking through our spiritual defenses, we lose far more than any earthly war could take from us.

Therefore, brothers and sisters, we must guard our hearts with vigilance. We must become strong soldiers of Christ, warriors who resist the devil and cast him out. When we are victorious individually, our victory ripples outward, inspiring and strengthening those around us. Our faith becomes alive, and we bear the fruits of love, humility, self-sacrifice, and prayer. This is a great threat to the devil and a profound joy to Christ. Let us remain steadfast, protecting our hearts and living as faithful witnesses to the light of Christ in a dark and troubled world.

This is why Christ came into the world—to bring light, life, and victory over darkness. May He grant us the strength, motivation, and inspiration to bear witness to His truth, to walk in the company of saints, and to follow in the footsteps of the apostles. As the Apostle Paul said, *"Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ"* (1 Corinthians 11:1). We are called to live Christ, to manifest Him to the world through our words, actions, and very lives. 

In the midst of turmoil, danger, and the encroaching darkness that seeks to envelop the world, may the Lord sustain us. May He give us consolation, joy, and unwavering faith. Let us be children of light, shining brightly in a world that desperately needs His truth and love. May the life and resurrection of Christ work powerfully in our hearts, transforming us and those around us. 

God bless you, brothers and sisters. May we remain steadfast in our faith, courageous in our witness, and ever faithful to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
