# When is it necessary to fight, and when to keep off

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about war.  
There are different types of war, and there is a lot of war going on in the world right now.  
People are even talking about World War III, nuclear war, and many other things.  
We also know about information wars, economic wars, and all kinds of wars.  
But for a Christian, the most important war, of course, is spiritual warfare—the spiritual struggle.  
This spiritual struggle can also manifest itself in the physical world.  
For us, it is the most significant war there can be, and it is one that we cannot avoid—we must not avoid it.  
We cannot keep away from it.  

So, let me first speak about this war.  
Even though it may seem less important compared to the large-scale conflicts we see—where people wear camouflage gear and such—it has even become popular in a way, like in computer games, tank battles, or Star Wars movies. Action movies, which people love to watch, are everywhere. The world is very aggressive.  
The Lord said that great wars are coming, and you will hear about wars and rumors of wars, but do not be afraid, for that is not the end.  

I will say a little about the wars happening now, especially the Russia-Ukraine war, which is causing suffering worldwide, though Russia and Ukraine are suffering the most.  
Before delving into that, let me speak about the most important war: the spiritual war.  
It is crucial to distinguish this, because some people claim that certain wars are "holy wars."  
For example, both sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict frame their struggle in spiritual terms.  
Russia claims it is fighting against the West, against what it calls "anti-Christian values," and says it is battling the devil.  
Ukraine, on the other hand, claims that Putin is the embodiment of evil and that they are fighting for democracy, human rights, and freedom, believing they are on God's side.  
Both sides are deeply mistaken in framing the conflict this way.  

This is a separate issue, and I will address it in the second part of my message today.  
First, I want to emphasize that the spiritual war is a war against evil—evil within us, evil outside of us, and the forces of darkness.  
As the Apostle Paul says, we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the powers of darkness.  
This war has external expressions, such as heresies, schisms, apostasy, and worldliness within the Church. These are areas where we lose ground in the spiritual battle.  

On an individual level, spiritual warfare involves ascetic practices, prayer, fasting, acts of mercy, and following Christ daily.  
Spiritual reading, education, Christian enlightenment, evangelization, and mission work are all expressions of spiritual warfare.  
When we go to places or people living in darkness, bound by false ideas and demonic influences, and with the Lord's help, we break those chains and liberate them—this is spiritual warfare in action.  

Any form of Christian virtue or ministry in the Church is part of this spiritual battle.  
When we minister to others, we minister to the Lord. Pastoral ministry, helping in the Church, sponsorship, and all forms of blessed ministry are expressions of spiritual warfare.  
Of course, there are false or fake ministries, and even good ministries can sometimes be driven by wrong intentions, such as pride, vainglory, or careerism.  
But when our ministry is righteous, virtuous, and free from such motives, it becomes a true expression of spiritual warfare, visible in the material world through the work being done.  

However, some aspects of spiritual warfare remain unseen.

This is the fight against sin, against evil, against temptation, against passions, and against the self.  
Much of this battle is unseen. It cannot be perceived with carnal eyes.  
It takes place in the hearts and minds of Christians.  
This is spiritual warfare.  

Having said that, we cannot run away from this warfare.  
The Lord will judge those who hide, who lack the courage or vision to engage in this battle.  
Consider the parable of the talents: the master gave five talents to one servant, two to another, and one to the last.  
The first two servants invested their talents and earned more.  
The last servant buried his talent in the ground. He did not waste it or misuse it—he simply preserved it and returned it to the master in full.  
Yet, the Lord condemned him, sending him to the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.  
This teaches us that without bearing fruit, our faith will condemn us.  

We may believe in Christ, but if we do nothing with the talents, education, abilities, time, or connections He has given us, we are failing.  
If we say, "We are weak; we just want a simple life, our own little world," then we are not truly Christians.  
If we do nothing for the Lord, our lives are meaningless, and we will be condemned—more severely than pagans or even satanists.  
Let us reflect deeply on this.  
Let us not deceive ourselves with false humility.  
A Christian is a warrior of Christ, and a warrior must go to war.  

Now, let me speak about the wars fought with guns, rockets, and missiles.  
We must always remember the Lord's words: "Whoever lives by the sword will die by the sword."  
In the Old Testament, we also see that whoever sheds the blood of others will have their own blood shed, for humans are created in the image of God.  
The meek, as Scripture says, will inherit the earth.  
We must keep these words in mind.  

On a personal level, I would not encourage a Christian to go to war, especially in the current context.  
What is different now?  
In the past, when a country went to war, everyone was mobilized, and it was considered a duty to fight.  
Refusing to serve meant breaking the law and betraying one's people, family, and country, as the enemy could invade, kill, and enslave.  

Two hundred years ago, the situation was clearer.  
The government's interests often aligned with those of the people.  
Monarchs and governments sought to protect their nations from invasion and ensure prosperity.  
However, with the rise of empires, wars became more about expansion, power, and colonial gain.  
The First World War, for example, was an imperialistic conflict where many soldiers did not fully understand what they were fighting for.  
They were told it was for nationalism—for France, Germany, or Russia—but deep down, they sensed they were fighting for other, less noble interests.  

Since then, the situation has grown even more complex.  
Today, governments often wage wars for motivations and goals that differ from what is proclaimed in newspapers or on TV.  
Propaganda obscures the truth, and the interests of those in power may not align with the well-being of the people.  

As Christians, we must discern carefully and remember that our ultimate allegiance is to Christ, not to any earthly power.  
We are called to be peacemakers and to seek justice, but we must also recognize that not all wars are fought for righteous causes.  
Let us pray for wisdom, courage, and the strength to engage in the spiritual warfare that truly matters, while remaining steadfast in our commitment to the Lord's teachings.

No matter which side you support in the Russia-Ukraine conflict—whether it’s Russia or the West—both sides are driven by propaganda.  
The stated goals are often lies, and the real motivations are hidden.  
This applies not just to this conflict but to many others involving nations like China, the United States, and others.  
The concept of a nation or country has changed.  
Those in power are often not directly tied to any single country.  
Global corporations, international financial capital, and other hidden forces operate behind the scenes.  
No one will openly reveal the true goals of these wars.  

If you don’t know the real purpose of a war, participating in it becomes a sin.  
How do you know if the war is being waged for the sake of the Antichrist?  
If you don’t understand the true motivations and goals, you could be fighting and dying for purposes that oppose God’s will.  
Therefore, I strongly advise you to stay as far away as possible from such conflicts.  

I cannot openly call for disobedience to the government or encourage breaking the law by avoiding conscription, as that would be illegal and could even lead to imprisonment.  
But on an individual level, I urge you to think carefully before participating in any war.  
Especially if it is not clear that your home is being invaded, your property destroyed, or your family harmed.  
Even in such cases, prayer may be far more powerful than taking up arms.  

The same caution applies to information wars, which are now widespread.  
Even priests have become brainwashed, taking sides in these conflicts.  
By supporting one side or the other, they are essentially calling for more bloodshed, more fighting, and more destruction.  
This is just another form of warfare, and I advise against participating in it—whether it’s an information war, a hot war, or any other kind of conflict that isn’t spiritual warfare.  

History shows us that the stated goals of wars and revolutions often differ from the real ones.  
For example, many who fought for the Russian Revolution believed in its ideals, but the Bolsheviks’ true intentions were different.  
Those who supported the revolution were eventually killed by the very leaders they helped bring to power.  
This pattern repeats in many wars, where the real goals are political and hidden.  

We must stay as far away as possible from such conflicts.  
Even in our conversations, we should be cautious and avoid getting entangled in these matters.  
The news, the noise, the constant updates—they are distractions, pulling us away from what truly matters: spiritual warfare.  

Let us focus on our spiritual lives and the work of bringing Christ’s message to the world.  
This is our true calling.  
You may be surprised to find how many people around you are searching for Christ but have never heard the truth.  
They may be right next to you, waiting for someone to share the faith with them.  

May the Lord guide us in our ministry, protect us from mistakes and delusions, and help us remain steadfast in our spiritual warfare.  
May He be with you always.
