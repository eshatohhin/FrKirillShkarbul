# How are anger & other passions rooted in the Apostasy

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
The Holy Church celebrates Pascha, the resurrection of Christ, for 40 days, until the Ascension.  
During these 40 days, we greet one another with "Christ is risen!" and respond, "Indeed, He is risen!" or "He is truly risen!"  
We wear red clothes and chant the "Troparion of Pascha."  
These days are filled with brightness and draw us into a closer relationship with God.  
The sense of separation between the earthly world and the divine heavenly world fades, for the Lord appeared to His disciples for 40 days after His resurrection. He came to them many times, explaining the prophecies, revealing the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and outlining the mission they were to accomplish.  

For the disciples, these 40 days were a miraculous time when their Teacher was still present among them. He appeared suddenly in closed rooms, demonstrating supernatural abilities, yet His body remained physical. This was a mind-blowing experience, as He was no longer bound by mortal life but was still with them. This was a foretaste of the Kingdom of Heaven, which descended upon the apostles, giving them a profound experience of divine reality.  

This unity of heaven and earth is a constant reality for the Church, but it is especially palpable during this time. These 40 days are the most blessed and miraculous period of the entire year.  

However, there is a great risk, particularly for Orthodox Christians, of becoming complacent. After fasting for 40 days (actually seven weeks), it is now a time of celebration—praising the Lord, rejoicing in His resurrection, and proclaiming His victory. Yet, it is easy to lose spiritual vigilance and fall back into old passions and sins.  

The Holy Fathers warn that after Pascha, our spiritual life must not diminish; rather, it should become even more active. Our hearts have been transformed, and we feel the joy and support of the resurrected Lord. This is a time for prayer, repentance, and the Jesus Prayer, not for indulgence in food, drink, or relaxation.  

With this in mind, I want to address some spiritual passions today, as they often go unnoticed. While carnal passions like gluttony or lust are easier to recognize, spiritual passions are more subtle and harder to detect, especially within ourselves.  

The Greek term *idipathia* combines *idone* (pleasure) and *pathia* (passion). It refers to finding pleasure in satisfying a passion. This is straightforward when it involves physical desires, but the same principle applies to spiritual passions, which are far more insidious and difficult to identify.  

Each passion warrants extensive discussion, but today I will focus on a few, particularly anger.  

First, let us turn to the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter 1, verses 25-26. He speaks of the Gentiles, saying, "They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions." Paul goes on to describe various carnal and perverted behaviors, but this principle applies to all passions.

We truly slip into passions when we separate ourselves from God. This alienation, this distancing from the Lord, opens the door for passions to take hold. Often, we think that having a passion or sinning is simply due to personal weakness—whether it’s a struggle with alcohol, inappropriate desires, or anything else. We assume that the problem lies in our inability to overcome these weaknesses. However, this is merely a symptom, not the root cause.  

As the Apostle Paul explains, the root cause is our separation from the Lord. When we distance ourselves from God, we become vulnerable to these passions, which then dominate our thoughts, bodies, and hearts. Whoever sins becomes a slave to sin. Therefore, the solution lies in addressing the root cause—our disconnection from God.  

This is why the spiritual life and the Jesus Prayer are so vital. They help us maintain continuous unity with the Lord, fostering a repentant heart and a constant awareness of His presence. We must take up our cross and follow Him daily. To achieve this, we need the prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, and a wholehearted dedication to God. Our love for the Lord must remain alive and fruitful. Otherwise, passions will inevitably arise, like dust accumulating in an uncleaned room or weeds growing in an untended field. Without nurturing our relationship with God, these passions will take root.  

This principle applies not only to pagans but also to the Israelites of old, as we will discuss shortly, and to Christians today. We, too, fall into sin, and it is not enough to merely list our sins in confession. We must identify the root causes, many of which lie in spiritual passions that often go unnoticed.  

There are many such passions: selfishness, despondency, ambition (in a negative sense), love of power, greed, accusation, vainglory, pride, anger, and more. These spiritual passions are subtle, but if we examine ourselves attentively, we will see that we often derive sinful pleasure from them. This is also a form of *idipathia*—finding pleasure in satisfying a passion.  

It may seem puzzling why submitting to passions feels so pleasurable, while fasting, praying, and pursuing virtue often feel difficult. This is due to our fallen nature. We are alienated from God, and as a result, we struggle to find joy in righteousness, holiness, and virtue. Yet, this is our ultimate goal—to rediscover the joy that comes from living in union with God.  

Passions can be categorized not only as carnal and spiritual but also as psychological or soul-related. These belong not to the spirit but to the soul. For example, the passion for excessive communication—spending hours chatting, joking, or indulging in gossip—falls into this category. Such passions, though less obvious, still distance us from God and hinder our spiritual growth.  

Therefore, let us strive to remain vigilant, nurturing our love for God and seeking His presence through prayer, repentance, and a life of virtue. Only then can we overcome the grip of passions and experience the true joy of the Kingdom of Heaven.

It’s narcissism—constantly looking at yourself and thinking, "I’m so nice." Anger is another example. Of course, it’s not always easy to draw clear lines between what is carnal, what is soul-related, and what is spiritual. These categories are not rigid or scientific; they are simply tools for understanding. For instance, spiritual passions might include blasphemy or the spirit of the Pharisees. The Pharisees pretended to be righteous, but their holiness was fake, and they often didn’t even realize it. They thought they were holy, yet they destroyed others’ lives through accusation, judgment, and hypocrisy.  

One passion I want to focus on is anger. Often, we only notice our anger when it flares up, but in reality, we carry it with us all the time. It manifests when we judge others, complain about the weather, get irritated by someone on the subway, or react to a show or the news. When we read or hear news and say, "Oh, these are bad people," we are feeding into hatred. In fact, much of the news we consume—whether on TV, YouTube, or elsewhere—is a dissemination of passions. It fuels vanity, judgment, praise, and false hopes. It offers fake salvation, fake pleasure, and fake values. In the context of true salvation and grace, most of what we find in the news is empty. It replaces grace with money, making mammon the central religion of our time.  

This worship of money, or mammonism, is even worse than the paganism of old. Paganism at least had some connection to human nature, but mammonism dehumanizes people, reducing them to mere functions, obstacles, or economic agents. It strips away love and compassion, leaving people disconnected from their humanity.  

The news propagates anger in various forms—war, economics, politics, sports, and entertainment. Depending on your interests, you might be drawn to one area or another. Some people are consumed by war issues, taking sides and harboring hatred for one group while glorifying another. Others are obsessed with sports, hating rival teams and idolizing athletes. The same applies to entertainment, where people worship celebrities as idols. Politics is no different, with constant battles and enemies. All of this is rooted in anger, and it’s so attractive because people find pleasure in it. This is why people become addicted to news, gadgets, and social media—they are feeding their passion for anger, which blinds them to the truth.  

Let us turn to Isaiah 6:9-10, where the Lord speaks to Isaiah:  

*"Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.' Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return and be healed."*  

This passage reminds us of the danger of spiritual blindness. When we allow passions like anger to dominate our hearts, we become unable to see, hear, or understand the truth. We must guard our hearts and minds, turning away from the distractions and false pleasures of the world, and instead seek the true grace and salvation found in Christ. Only then can we be healed and restored to a right relationship with God.

This passage from Isaiah speaks not only to the Israel of that time but also to the new Israel of our days—the Church. It is a critique of us. The Lord says, *"Go and tell these people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.' Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return and be healed."* (Isaiah 6:9-10). These words are echoed by the Lord Himself in Matthew 13:15, emphasizing their importance.  

This is about us. We often refuse to listen to our conscience. We replace living faith and love with empty rituals, secular activities, and superficial practices. People see through this façade. They recognize that there is no real love, no genuine relationship with the Lord. Sadly, many so-called Christians—including priests, monks, and bishops—fall into this trap, which poses a great risk to the Church, not as an institution, but as the body of Christ.  

Let us consider the consequences if we fail to address this. Isaiah asks, *"Lord, how long?"* And the Lord responds, *"Until the cities lie waste without inhabitant, and the houses without people, and the land is utterly desolate, and the Lord removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump."* (Isaiah 6:11-13).  

This passage speaks of desolation and destruction. Everything will be wiped away, but a remnant—a tenth—will remain. These are the holy ones, those who remain faithful to the Lord to the end. They are the ones who preserve their hearts attached to the Lord, filled with joy, love, and a relentless search for truth. They will be preserved, while everything else will be swept away.  

Today, people speak of famine, pandemics, wars, and other calamities. These will come on a large scale, not because of the actions of presidents or the existence of weapons, but because people have turned away from the Lord. The greatest problem is not the world at large but the Christians who are abandoning the Lord. They bear the greatest responsibility, especially Orthodox Christians.  

Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, let us repent. Let us seek the Lord with all our hearts and remain faithful to Him, no matter what. Let us receive the grace of His resurrection, stand firm in His holiness, and bear witness to His love until the end of the world. Amen. God bless you, dear brothers and sisters.
