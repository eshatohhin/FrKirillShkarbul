# Why wars and chaos The world loses its meaning

Dear brothers and sisters, many of us are surprised that we have entered the 21st century, yet we still face wars, famine, and various other problems in this world. Now, we are witnessing a significant reset taking place, with plans to build a new and better world. 

We are also experiencing numerous natural disasters. While these events may seem to have different natures and origins, there is one important underlying reason for them. This reason was indicated by the Lord Himself. He said that these are signs of humanity's apostasy and the second coming of Jesus Christ. 

These events share a common thread: they result from deceit and the wrong choices made by mankind. These choices prioritize earthly well-being, prosperity, and enjoyment in this world, while disregarding spiritual matters. Over the centuries, humanity has gradually shifted from idealistic values to more materialistic ones.

Today, I want to provide an overview of how we arrived at this situation and relate it to the problems we are currently facing, such as the recent global sickness, the ongoing great reset, and the wars that are happening now. I also aim to draw some conclusions about what we can expect on a broader scale and how we should confront or respond to these changes in the world.

To understand these changes, we need to look back at least 400 years, to the 17th century, following the Thirty Years' War—a series of religious conflicts in Europe. These wars were a sign that people still cared deeply about faith and religion, to the point of being willing to die for their beliefs. Although their actions were misguided, they held higher values in high regard.

After these wars, there was a great disillusionment with truth, authority, and the idea of God's presence and guidance in the world. This disillusionment led to significant changes. In politics, we saw the collapse of monarchies, as people no longer believed in the divine origin of royal power. They no longer saw anything supernatural in it. There was a shift toward rationalistic thinking in philosophy, science, and other areas.

This period also saw a great expansion of trade and industry, as people became more focused on production, consumption, and improving their material conditions. This down-to-earth approach led to 300 years of capitalism. I am generalizing here, focusing more on Europe than the United States, but similar processes of materialism occurred in China and Russia as well. Societies became increasingly focused on production, military strength, and empirical sciences.

I am not suggesting that these developments are fake or that science is invalid. Rather, I am highlighting the shift in focus. Over centuries, societies and individuals became more and more engrossed in earthly matters. Within this materialistic world, new socialist ideas emerged, aiming to take materialism to the next level. These ideas are entirely materialistic, with no room for the spiritual or supernatural. Everything is determined by physical and social processes, and many people believe in this worldview.

I can also tell you that today's capitalists, particularly those involved in inclusive capitalism, operate with a mindset that resembles a form of Kabbalistic materialistic mysticism. Some compare it to Spinoza's thinking, where God is equated with nature—essentially a form of pantheism. Even today, many people believe in various mystical powers, astrology, and New Age ideologies.

In summary, the world has undergone a profound shift from spiritual and idealistic values to materialistic and earthly concerns. This shift has led to the challenges we face today, and understanding this transition is crucial as we navigate the changes and uncertainties of our time.

All of this can also be called materialism, even when it involves beliefs in unseen powers or forces. It suggests that there is something beyond the tangible, scientific world—something we cannot see, akin to magic. People believe they can harness these powers through certain methods, making it seem spiritual, but it is not truly so. 

Another point to consider is that some claim we still have spirituality through concerts, classical music, art, and movies depicting ancient aristocracies and cultural themes. However, much of this is superficial. We watch movies about heroes, but we do not live by the values those heroes represent. These portrayals are often fake, existing only on screen, disconnected from our real lives. Alternatively, some experiences are purely emotional, stirring feelings of pity, sorrow, excitement, or other sensations. This is particularly prevalent in Catholic countries and Catholicism, though not exclusive to it. Such emotional experiences are often mistaken for spirituality, but they are merely reactions of the soul, not the spirit. True spirituality is connected to the absolute, to ideals—whether right or wrong, materialistic or spiritual—that are not relative but absolute. 

In materialism, as taught by Marx, everything is relative and grounded in a down-to-earth approach. Today, this mindset prioritizes economic growth, environmental concerns, and physical well-being. People focus on tangible issues like pollution, war, and material stability, but few are concerned with spiritual life or living according to the Gospel. This shift allowed Marx to propose his socialist theory in the 19th century, as society had already drifted far from spirituality. Materialism became the dominant lens through which societal events and phenomena were explained. 

Now, the situation has worsened. The Lord asked, "When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?" True faith has become exceedingly rare, as materialism dominates every aspect of life. We are preoccupied with bills, food, clothing, entertainment, and earthly fears—losing jobs, facing uncertainty. We lack trust in the Lord, neglect prayer, and fail to live by or even read the Gospel. We are enslaved by the world and its material concerns. 

This enslavement enables those in power to manipulate society further. They can predict and program behavior, allowing them to orchestrate resets, wars, and other events to build a new world—a world ruled by mammon and the prince of this world. As the Lord said, this ruler has nothing in Him and is hostile to everything Christian. 

The religion of the future will likely be a fusion of all existing religions, serving the new world order and its materialistic mindset. It will be entirely enslaved to the values of mammon, devoid of true spirituality. In this context, we must remain vigilant, holding fast to our faith and the absolute truths of the Gospel, even as the world around us shifts further into materialism and away from God.

This future religion will not embody true Christianity or the values that come from God. Instead, it will be entirely rooted in the worldview and order being constructed by this materialistic age. The true enemy of Marxism and all materialistic ideologies and policies is genuine Christianity—the Church of Jesus Christ. This is why there were such severe persecutions in the Soviet Union in the past, and why there will be persecutions in the future for those who remain faithful to the Holy Gospel and refuse to compromise with false values.

Many false values—nationalistic, ideological, or otherwise—are used to manipulate people, fueling wars and conflicts. When we recognize how all-encompassing this materialistic mindset and world order have become, the question arises: What do we do? What do we give up? The answer is simple: we give up nothing, because we are not slaves to this world. As long as we maintain our spiritual life, live according to the Spirit, and place our trust in the Lord, we can overcome all fears and the conditioning imposed by this materialistic world. 

We become like David, who, with the Lord's blessing, overthrew the giant Goliath. For a Christian living according to the Gospel, the external world—with its fears, wars, economic oppression, and relentless brainwashing through media, gadgets, or even brain chips—is like a giant looming over us. But with faith in the Lord, we stand unafraid, knowing that loyalty to Him enables us to overthrow all these forces.

Such faith, however, is now exceedingly rare, almost absent. Even among Orthodox Christians, true faithfulness is scarce, and other denominations are often deeply enslaved—mentally, ideologically, or emotionally—by the materialistic world. They have already been brainwashed and subdued by its influence.

Therefore, let us not fear, no matter what comes—war, pandemic, famine, or even nuclear conflict. We must remain steadfast in the Lord, loyal to Him, strong in prayer, and unwavering in our testimony of love. We must continue to love our neighbors and even our enemies, living by values entirely contrary to those the world teaches. 

May the Lord grant us His strength, guidance, and blessings. God bless you all.
