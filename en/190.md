# The prince of this world is behind governments on both sides of the war

Dear brothers and sisters, I have returned to Taiwan from Sri Lanka and India.  
The mission there is developing and progressing.  
If you are interested in the mission in India, leave a comment, and I will also record a video about India.  

Now that I’m back, I want to share some thoughts with you about what’s happening in the world.  
People are becoming more and more brainwashed, and there’s the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.  
Where are things heading, and how do we prepare for what’s coming or what might come?  

First of all, I want to clarify that when we talk about the Antichrist or the agenda of the devil,  
it’s not about conspiracy theories or fake fantasies.  
The Apostle Paul says that the mystery of lawlessness is already at work—it’s a process unfolding.  
The Lord Himself refers to the devil as the “prince of this world.”  
Where is he? It’s not always evident.  
So, when we discuss these things, it might sound conspiratorial, but this is spiritual reality.  

Another mistake people make is assuming that evil is almighty—that it controls all governments and everything.  
But no, it’s not almighty.  
For over 2,000 years, evil has been unable to achieve its ultimate goal.  
In fact, it’s been much longer than that.  
From the beginning of humanity, the devil has had the idea of controlling the whole world, and he has inspired people to pursue this.  

This spirit of Leviathan, this monstrous force, has been present everywhere, including here in China.  
Qin Shi Huang, the emperor who unified China, also embodied this spirit.  
He killed wise people, implemented legalism, and promoted the philosophy that only power can solve all problems and control everything.  
This is similar to modern technocrats who want to use AI to control the world.  
Qin Shi Huang had this idea over 2,000 years ago, around 200 BC.  

Yet, despite all these years, they have not achieved their goal.  
Will they succeed in our lifetime? Maybe, maybe not.  
But the main question isn’t about them—it’s about us.  
What will become of each and every one of us?  
What will we contribute to this world?  

If the Antichrist comes during our lifetime, what will we be like at that time?  
Will we be spiritually strong, united with Christ, filled with peace in our hearts, and love for everyone?  
Right now, even when we talk about evil, many Christians react with anger, hatred, or even violence.  
This alienates us from Christ. If we don’t have love in our hearts, we are separated from Him.  

What about our health?  
Will we be ruined by our lifestyles, leaving us unable to resist the new systems or governments that may arise?  
The big question for each of us is: What will become of us at that time?  
I don’t know how many years from now that might be.  

If we don’t live to see that day, it’s crucial that we pass on our experience, wisdom, and spiritual legacy to our children and those around us—  
to those who will face these delusions and realities in the future.  
This is what the Lord expects from each of us.  

To achieve this, we must remain united with God through prayer and the Holy Community—not just by reading the Bible.  
Yes, we read and believe, but if we’re not united with Him, we risk being deceived and becoming just another heresy among the thousands out there.  
Many claim to believe in Christ, but without true unity with Him, it means nothing.  
For the devil, such superficial faith is no obstacle.  

Those who live in delusion fall into syncretism, ecumenism, and eventually the one-world religion of the Antichrist.  
Let us stay vigilant, rooted in love, and united with Christ, so we may stand firm in the face of what is to come.

So, that raises another question.  
Even though evil is not almighty, it seems to be making progress.  
It’s getting closer to its goal.  
What are the signs of this?  

One sign I’ve already mentioned is **total brainwashing**.  
People are easily manipulated.  
For example, many were convinced that the threat of the virus was catastrophic, and they accepted it without question.  
Now, with the war, half the people believe one narrative, and the other half believe the opposite.  
Both sides are brainwashed, which is why they fight.  
Many are even willing to die for their beliefs.  
When you realize that both narratives are forms of brainwashing, you’ll see the world as a kind of “zombie land.”  
This is a sign that people have been “hacked” and are ready to accept whatever they’re told.  

Eventually, when the world seems so bad, a “Savior” will appear, offering peace, health, and solutions.  
Why wouldn’t people accept this new system?  
This is another sign that we’re not far from that reality.  

Another sign is the role of **governments**.  
Most governments, if not all, are instruments of the Antichrist—willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly.  
Behind them is the spirit of the Antichrist.  
Sinners often act without understanding why; they’re driven by forces beyond their control.  
Many leaders are occultists, seeking inspiration from mystical, dark sources.  
They don’t have to be geniuses—though the Antichrist himself will be a genius among geniuses.  
Those involved in this “big game” are often driven by sin, passions, or being “hacked” spiritually.  

In the current conflict, both sides are likely playing the same game.  
There may even be collusion behind the scenes—I believe there is, based on what I’ve seen in war zones.  
But whether or not that’s true, the Antichrist is behind both sides.  
There’s no clear “good vs. evil” here—both are part of the same system.  

The third sign is harder to grasp: the creation of **anti-reality**.  
This is a reality that feels real but is opposed to truth.  
It’s not true, but it’s real.  
The Antichrist shapes world processes—economic, social, technological, and informational—to push everything toward his kingdom.  
This anti-reality becomes more and more pervasive.  

In the past, propaganda and ideology drove people—like under Nazi rule or other regimes.  
People were swept up in a collective spirit, believing lies as truth.  
This is why, throughout history, Christians who followed Jesus were often rejected by their families and societies.  
Their families would say, “You’re crazy! This is fanaticism!”  
That’s because the world lives in a delusional reality—real to them, but not true.  

Now, anti-reality is advancing even further.  
With modern technology and information systems, the Antichrist’s influence is stronger than ever.  
We must recognize this and hold fast to the truth, even when the world around us embraces lies.  

(Sorry for the noise—it might be a garbage truck outside.)  

In summary, the signs are clear: brainwashing, corrupt governments, and the creation of anti-reality.  
We must stay vigilant, rooted in truth, and united with Christ to resist these forces.

That was one of the manifestations of this **anti-reality**.  
People, once brainwashed, do crazy things.  
We’ve seen this in the Soviet Union and many other places.  
Now, this phenomenon is becoming global and increasingly totalitarian.  
People are losing their own will, and it will only get worse.  

We’re moving toward the **metaverse**, virtual reality, and other technological advancements.  
Neuralink, for example, is rapidly progressing in this direction.  
I’m not against technology itself, but I am against its use for the agenda of the Antichrist.  

The **spirit of delusion** is everywhere—just look around.  
If you can see that what’s reported in the news, regardless of which side it supports, is fake,  
it’s likely because you’re either discerning or aligned with Christ.  
The Spirit of Christ reveals the truth and warns, “No, that’s fake.”  

The Antichrist will present himself as a savior, much like Christ.  
He will appear to offer solutions and salvation.  
But only those with the gift of discernment from the Lord will recognize, “There’s something wrong with this.”  
Most people will embrace him, thinking, “This is great! This is it!”  
They’ll accept his mark—whether a tattoo on the hand or ear—and believe they can live freely, buy, sell, and do as they please.  

But a few will resist, saying, “No, this is fake.”  
These individuals will be willing to sacrifice everything to avoid accepting his system.  
However, they will be few in number, and many will become martyrs.  

So, we must prepare ourselves.  
Let us remain steadfast with the Lord, cultivating spiritual opposition to all delusion and deception.  
We must not be tricked by politics, economics, sustainable development agendas, ecological movements, or any other tools of manipulation.  

May the Lord grant us His peace, wisdom, and blessing.  
May He help us overcome all forms of delusion and evil.  
Lord, bless us and keep us strong in the truth. Amen.
