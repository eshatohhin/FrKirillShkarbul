# “The Great Reset” as an Anti-Baptism

Dear brothers and sisters, today we live in a world of ecumenism and the ongoing phenomenon of the "great reset," and I want to clarify a few things.  
Regarding ecumenism, I have already addressed this in a couple of videos in the past. The problem is that people perceive blessings in Buddhism, in the church, in Muslim deities, and so on. There is fasting in Buddhism, fasting in the church, temples in Buddhism, Taoism, and the holy church. There are priests, rituals, holy objects, and scriptures. Many things seem similar, leading to a strong tendency to say, "Well, it's all the same. Everyone is seeking truth, and they are trying to find it through different paths and understandings." Essentially, it’s all about being a good person, fostering a sense of holiness, and living in peace with everyone.  

This mindset paves the way for a world religion. In ancient times, various cults attempted to mimic or copy the holy church, adopting very similar rituals. The holy fathers and apologists recognized that this was the work of the devil, as the devil seeks to mimic God. He is like a monkey of God, trying to wield the same power over the world and pretending to be God. These cults, originating from the devil, aim to resemble God and the holy church, leading people astray.  

For example, the cult of Mithra even had something resembling Holy Communion, with bread and water. They broke bread and shared water, imitating the Holy Communion of the church. The holy fathers pointed out that while one comes from God, the other comes from demons. God liberates and grants freedom, whereas the enemy enslaves. God justifies and forgives sins, ensuring you are not condemned. But the enemy, already condemned himself, cannot free you from condemnation.  

The Lord heals and provides cure, while the enemy seeks to kill and destroy. God grants truth, wisdom, and knowledge, but the devil deceives, lies, and ensnares. God supports and acts for your good, knowing what is best for you. The enemy, however, obstructs your growth, spoils your plans, and offers only counterfeit gifts. The Lord saves and rescues you from danger and death, but the devil ensures your destruction.  

God is gracious and gives to His creation, but the devil is a thief who steals. This is what you encounter in these false systems and outside the holy Church of God. The deceit and harm from the devil are unavoidable if you make false choices.  

Now, I want to say a few words about baptism—how we enter the Church, what we gain, and what the so-called "great reset" pretends to offer. It presents itself as an anti-baptism, offering something not just to individuals but to the entire world and society globally.  

These parallels can be drawn with any major revolution, such as the Russian Bolshevik Revolution, the Chinese Communist Revolution, or the French Revolution—any significant social upheaval.

Okay, I’m not talking about industrial or technological revolutions but rather about significant social changes driven by ideological shifts that completely transform society.  

So, what do we gain in holy baptism? We gain true life from God. In contrast, the so-called "great reset" promises a new life in a new future, contingent on undergoing certain procedures. It claims that by following these steps, you will gain this life and avoid the fate of those who refuse. Holy baptism connects us with God, our Lord, while the "great reset" offers a connection to a digital, data-driven world—a realm of advanced technologies, often referred to as the "digital Leviathan" or the AI-driven future. This new world is presented as the source of all knowledge, health improvements, products, and abilities. It is an alternative to the life offered by God.  

In holy baptism, we receive enlightenment through the light of God. However, the "great reset" claims to offer its own form of enlightenment. Those who embrace it are portrayed as enlightened, while those who reject it are labeled as uneducated, backward, or stuck in feudal times. This narrative of enlightenment is not unique to the current era; it echoes historical movements like the European Enlightenment of the 18th century.  

Baptism grants us victory over demons, freeing us from their power. Similarly, the "great reset" promises victory over various challenges: viruses, ecological crises, economic and social issues, and even poverty through "inclusive capitalism." The Holy Fathers warn that the Antichrist will present himself as a savior of the exploited and the miserable, much like Lenin claimed to save the proletariat. This pattern repeats in the promises of the "great reset."  

Holy baptism brings us into the kingdom of God, the heavenly kingdom. The "great reset," on the other hand, envisions a "beautiful new world," a phrase popularized by Aldous Huxley. This new world is portrayed as a technologically advanced, socially harmonious utopia, with figures like Mark Zuckerberg promoting the metaverse as a virtual reality paradise.  

The Lord provides us with the food of life, while the "great reset" offers a minimal allowance or universal basic income, ensuring subsistence for those connected to the system. Without this connection, access to basic necessities is restricted.  

In baptism, we receive the seal of the Holy Spirit, granting us access to His power, and we bear the sign of the Cross as a visible mark of our dedication to Christ and His saving grace. In contrast, the "great reset" proposes digital identifiers, such as health codes or "green passes," which grant access to societal benefits and privileges.  

These parallels highlight the stark contrast between the life and promises offered by God through holy baptism and the counterfeit alternatives presented by worldly systems like the "great reset."

Just receive this today, and everything will be yours." So, similar promises are made.  

When we enter the Church, we understand that those who remain outside, who do not choose this path, will ultimately perish. Similarly, the proponents of the "great reset" claim that those who reject their vision—anti-vaxxers, for example—will face exclusion or death. They are told they have no place in this new world and may be relegated to marginalized areas like Africa or ghettos, effectively cut off from participation in this new system.  

In baptism, we experience the birth of a new man, a renewed human being. The "great reset" promises a similar transformation: the creation of a digital self, a digital copy, endowed with new abilities. In the Church, we speak of gaining new talents and gifts from the Lord, surpassing our fallen nature. The "great reset," however, promotes transhumanism, promising to transcend human limitations through genetic modifications, neurological enhancements, and extended lifespans—perhaps even living to 150 years.  

In the Church, we gain independence from the world, rising above its temptations and limitations. The "great reset" offers a different kind of freedom: liberation from gender, morality, and traditional values. It dismisses moral principles as outdated superstitions from the Middle Ages and promotes a society where individuals are free from societal constraints, living in isolation through social distancing and online interactions. Yet, while the Church provides a new spiritual family, the "great reset" offers a digital family in the metaverse or through platforms like Facebook—a poor substitute for the true familial bonds we find in Christ.  

Previous revolutions, such as those in the USSR, China, or France, implemented similar ideologies but on a local or national scale. The "great reset," however, aims for global implementation and irreversible change. It seeks to reshape humanity, creating a new society, a new generation, and a new human.  

One crucial distinction is the source of transformation. In holy baptism, the Holy Spirit accomplishes our renewal, uniting us with the body of Christ and granting us true life. The "great reset," though it does not openly acknowledge it, operates under a different spirit—the spirit of deceit and lies. The Holy Fathers warn that in the times of the Antichrist, people will follow this agenda en masse, believing lies because they have chosen sin.  

To guard against this deception, we need a spiritual vaccine: a life rooted in Christ and His new covenant. If we remain with Christ, living in His grace, we can be confident that no matter what happens in the world—even if the Antichrist rises—we will not be overtaken or deceived.  

May the Lord grant us His grace, strength, and wisdom to remain steadfast in Christ, avoiding all forms of deception. Let us grow stronger in Him, secure in the knowledge that as long as we abide in His truth, we are safe.
