# Wrong Interpretations of The Apocalypse

Dear brothers and sisters, we live in a very unstable world. The world has endured many significant wars and epidemics in the past. For the past few decades, it has been relatively more stable, but now we are entering a time of great turmoil—tempests, wars, epidemics, social change, and the so-called "great reset" that is being discussed. Something new and unexpected, something unforeseeable, is on the horizon. Many people are dying en masse or losing their sanity. Both the faithful and even those who do not believe in Christ are paying more attention to the Book of Revelation, the Apocalypse. Even the word "apocalypse" has become popular, though its secular understanding often reduces it to something extremely bad, like a zombie apocalypse or similar scenarios.

Let us take a moment to discuss the Book of Revelation, which is part of the Holy Scripture, to avoid unnecessary fears, secular misuse, or sectarian interpretations. Even within the Church, there is often a misunderstanding of this book. Today, we will not delve into scholarly debates about different interpretations, nor will we explore the book's content in detail. Instead, we will focus on the principles of approaching this book, aiming to present them in a basic and accessible manner, understandable even to a child.

First, I want to highlight three common misconceptions about the Book of Revelation. While there are more ways to misunderstand it, these three are particularly significant for our discussion.

The first misconception is a purely allegorical interpretation, which suggests that the book is merely a collection of moral teachings or symbolic truths. For example, the beast represents evil, and evil has certain characteristics, but it is not tied to any historical events. According to this view, the events described will not literally happen because many of the details are not specific. Even the specific elements can be interpreted allegorically. This approach resembles the Alexandrian tradition of allegorical interpretation of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, which was not the orthodox tradition. The orthodox tradition leaned more toward the Antiochian approach, though it was a blend of both. Today, we will not delve deeply into this scholarly discussion but will focus on identifying what is incorrect.

The second misconception, which is unfortunately prevalent in the Orthodox Church, is a purely literal and historical interpretation. This view holds that the Book of Revelation is solely about future events. If the Antichrist has not yet appeared, then we need not concern ourselves with this book. When he does come, we will deal with it then. For now, let us focus on the Gospel and pleasant teachings, avoiding the frightening topics in the Apocalypse to prevent fear or division. I am not suggesting that these events will not happen—there is indeed a historical dimension to the book. It speaks of events that will occur before and after the end of the world.

The third misconception, common in the Protestant world, involves linking the Apocalypse to modern politics. This is similar to the Jewish tradition, where every prophet is interpreted in light of current events. For example, Gog and Magog are identified with modern nations or leaders, and the Messiah's arrival is constantly anticipated. Over the past 2,000 years, more than 25 Messiahs have been expected, yet none have come. These interpretations often lead to speculative fantasies.

In summary, while the Book of Revelation contains allegorical elements, historical prophecies, and connections to future events, it is essential to approach it with a balanced understanding, avoiding extreme interpretations that either dismiss its relevance or reduce it to mere speculation.

People often take pride in wanting to be part of significant events, leading them to claim, "This is happening right now." This mindset is reminiscent of certain Jewish interpretations and is prevalent in some Protestant sects that eagerly link biblical prophecies to current events. After reading books by such pastors, one might become obsessed with the news, constantly monitoring what China, Russia, or Iran is doing, and speculating about what will happen next. This frenzy, however, is not the spirit of Holy Scripture, nor is it the purpose of the Book of Revelation. The Apocalypse was given to us as a source of consolation. Without it, Christians might feel unprepared, fearful, and abandoned by the Lord. Instead, the book reassures us that despite the coming tribulations, the Lord is aware and will remain with the saints until the very end. Moreover, the reign of the Antichrist will be brief—a point I will elaborate on shortly.

Saint Nicholas of Serbia, a modern saint of the 20th century, taught that the beginning of the world was good, as it was created by God, and so too will its end be good. The end of the world is not a tragedy, a failure, or a sign that God has lost. It may seem chaotic, as if humanity is descending into madness, but this is a complex topic we will not delve into deeply today. From the Book of Revelation, we must draw this central message: despite the turmoil, God is in control, and His plan will prevail.

Now, I must mention a fourth common misunderstanding, particularly popular among rationalistic Bible scholars. They argue that the Book of Revelation is merely a historical document, reflecting John's perspective on the Roman emperors of his time, such as Domitian. According to this view, John used allegorical language—depicting emperors as beasts—to secretly communicate his thoughts to the churches in Asia Minor. While there is some truth to this interpretation, it is not the primary or most significant layer of meaning in the Apocalypse.

So, what is the most relevant and important meaning we can derive from the Book of Revelation? First, we must move beyond the purely historical understanding that it is solely about the future arrival of the Antichrist, an event that may not occur in our lifetime. This narrow view can lead us to dismiss the book's relevance. Instead, consider the Gospel narratives. When we read about Jesus healing the paralytic or the blind, are these stories merely historical accounts of events that happened 2,000 years ago in Palestine? If we adopt a purely historical perspective, we might say, "Yes, Jesus healed that man, but he is long dead, so what does it matter to us today?" However, the deeper meaning lies in the spiritual lessons these stories offer. They teach us about the paralysis of our own hearts and souls, our need for Christ's healing, and how to transform our lives in the present.

Similarly, in the Book of Genesis, we encounter the story of the serpent tempting Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. Is this merely a historical account, or is it purely allegorical? Some argue that it is entirely allegorical, with no literal Adam, Eve, or serpent, and that it symbolizes the origins of sin. While allegorical interpretations have value, they are not the only way to understand these texts. The stories in Scripture often operate on multiple levels—historical, allegorical, and spiritual—each offering insights that are relevant to our lives today. The Book of Revelation, too, must be approached with this multifaceted understanding, avoiding the extremes of purely literal or purely allegorical interpretations.

Another understanding is that the story is purely historical, though few people would argue this today. If one insists on a strictly historical interpretation, that is where they end up. For example, one might say, "Yes, there was a woman long ago, and a snake came, and she ate the fruit—not necessarily an apple, as we don’t know what kind of fruit it was." But for us, the most important meaning lies in the spiritual lessons it teaches: how sin enters our lives, how it develops, how the devil tempts us step by step, how to resist it, and what happens to the human soul when it turns away from God’s commandments into disobedience. These stories offer profound spiritual and moral teachings, not just for individuals but for the entire Church. While the story has historical and allegorical dimensions—such as the symbolism of the snake representing evil—these are not its only meanings. The narrative operates on multiple levels, each providing insights into the nature of sin, temptation, and redemption.

Now, returning to the Book of Revelation, it speaks of what will happen at the end of time and beyond: the retribution for the devil, the Antichrist, and all who follow him, as well as the reward for the saints. However, it also speaks to us today, not just about preparing for the end times but about how the "mystery of lawlessness" is unfolding in our time, in our souls, and in the world around us. It reveals how this spiritual battle manifests itself and what we can do to resist it. I have discussed these topics in detail in my videos on the Antichrist and the mystery of lawlessness, which you can revisit for deeper understanding. Today, however, I will not delve into specifics but will instead provide a few examples to illustrate the importance of interpreting Revelation correctly.

One common mistake within the Church is to take the three-and-a-half-year reign of the Antichrist literally, as stated in Revelation. This is a literal interpretation, but Revelation is filled with symbolic numbers. Every number—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven—carries symbolic meaning, often with multiple layers of significance. Similarly, the imagery of the beast rising from the abyss or the sea, or the harlot of Babylon sitting on the beast, is not meant to be taken literally. Will there be an actual beast emerging from the sea, declaring itself the apocalyptic beast? Will a woman appear, announcing, "Hello, I am the harlot of Babylon," with "Babylon" and "666" written on her forehead? Of course not. These are symbolic images, but they point to real spiritual and physical realities that will unfold in our world. The symbols are not merely allegorical; they signify events and forces that will manifest on both spiritual and physical levels. 

In summary, the Book of Revelation must be approached with an understanding that transcends purely literal or purely allegorical interpretations. It speaks to the past, present, and future, offering guidance for our spiritual lives and preparing us for the ultimate fulfillment of God’s plan. The symbols and numbers in Revelation are rich with meaning, pointing to profound truths about the battle between good and evil, the nature of sin, and the ultimate triumph of God’s kingdom.

So, what about the three and a half years mentioned in Revelation? This number is half of seven, and seven carries significant symbolic meaning in Scripture. Seven often represents completeness or fullness—such as the seven days of creation, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven spirits before God’s throne, and the seven sacraments in the Church. The number seven signifies something whole, complete, and sometimes indefinite in time. Therefore, half of seven—three and a half—symbolizes limitation. The time of the Antichrist’s rule will be limited, not eternal. It doesn’t necessarily have to be exactly three and a half years. If people insist on a literal interpretation, they might say, "The prophecy is wrong because the Antichrist has been ruling for ten years now, so this can’t be the Antichrist." However, the true meaning is to provide consolation to the Church, assuring believers that the reign of the Antichrist, though it may seem endless, will indeed be limited. This knowledge offers hope and patience, encouraging the faithful to endure the associated sufferings for the glory of God.

Another example is the "mark of the beast." It is described as a mark, not a seal. There is a distinction between the "seal of the Holy Spirit" and the "mark of the beast." The mark of the beast is said to be on the right hand or forehead, and without it, one cannot buy or sell. This seems very specific, and it may indeed point to a future reality, such as a system where a physical or digital mark—like a QR code—controls access to commerce and daily life. For instance, during the recent global health crisis, we saw how quickly systems like QR codes could be implemented to restrict movement, travel, and access to goods and services. While having such a mark does not necessarily require one to reject Christ outright, it can gradually condition people to accept a system that opposes God’s will. 

However, there are clearer examples of systems that demand the rejection of Christ. In the Soviet Union, for instance, joining the Communist Party required individuals to declare themselves atheists, effectively rejecting Christ if they had previously been Christians. This is a direct parallel to the spiritual conflict described in Revelation, where allegiance to the Antichrist’s system requires the rejection of Christ. 

What is written in Revelation is already manifesting in various ways, long before the ultimate arrival of the Antichrist. We can see elements of the "harlot of Babylon," the "beast," and even "Leviathan" in the world today. For those with spiritual discernment, these symbols become increasingly clear as we observe the world around us. The key is to approach these realities without fear, trusting in the Lord and maintaining peace in our hearts. By doing so, we can navigate these times with clarity, recognizing where Christ is at work and where the spirit of Antichrist is active, all while remaining steadfast in our faith.

These are some of the insights I wanted to share today about how to approach the Book of Revelation. We must ask the Lord for wisdom, sobriety, and a fervent desire to serve Him, adjusting our spiritual lives accordingly. I do not recommend that those who are not yet stable in their prayer life, spiritual discipline, participation in the Eucharist, or overall church life read the Apocalypse on their own. Without a solid foundation, one might become overwhelmed, fall into fear, or be drawn into speculative fantasies. Instead, if you wish to explore Revelation, do so with the guidance of the Holy Fathers and their explanations. Reading it alone, without proper context, can lead to confusion or misinterpretation.

For those who are spiritually stable, by all means, engage with the Book of Revelation, but do not make it your sole focus. The first priority is to read, live by, and preach the Gospel. The other books of the Bible are also essential for a well-rounded spiritual life. There are courses and resources available for deeper study of Revelation, but I caution against getting lost in the minutiae or academic debates that might obscure the bigger picture. If you delve too deeply into scholarly works without a solid foundation, you risk missing the spiritual essence of the text.

The first step in understanding Revelation is to turn to the Holy Fathers. Their teachings provide the foundational understanding of what the book is truly about. From there, you can explore further, but always with discernment and a focus on the spiritual message rather than speculative details.

May the Lord grant us strength, blessing, and protection from every evil and from the apostasy described in the Apocalypse. May we remain steadfast in our faith, victorious in our spiritual battles, and live lives that are pleasing to the Lord. 

Lord bless you, brothers and sisters.
