# Orthodoxy in Canada. Part 2.

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are recording another video in Toronto, Canada, and I want to share a few more thoughts about Orthodoxy here, about the arrival of the faith in this place, and what is happening today in terms of mission and church ministry. Last time, I spoke about the monks from Valaam Monastery who came to Alaska at the end of the 18th century, in 1794, including Saint Herman of Alaska. They established a mission that continues to this day. However, even earlier than that, in 1592, there was a Greek explorer, Ioannis Phokas, who was sent by King Philip II of Spain to explore the coast of North America. In the areas along the Pacific Ocean, where British Columbia and Vancouver are now located, he conducted some explorations. Thus, he is the Orthodox explorer who first came to these lands so many years ago.

Following the mission that began later, 200 years afterward, by the monks and priests, they spread to all parts of North America, both in Canada and the United States. Priests whose names we know—Father Dmitry Kamenev, Father Michael Andriades, Father Jacob Korchinski, Hieromonk Arseny Chagovstov, and many others, including Father Vladimir Alexandrov—labored here more than 100 years ago, at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, not only missionaries but also large numbers of immigrants came to Canada to develop this land, arriving from Ukraine and other Orthodox regions, such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova. These people formed the foundation of what is now the Orthodox Church here. They preserved this faith and brought it to many local people from non-Orthodox countries, as well as to the indigenous populations.

At that time, the Church was under one jurisdiction, as I mentioned earlier. However, due to the Russian Revolution and other political and economic challenges—such as the First World War, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and conflicts in the Balkans and other regions, including Zakarpattia—these tensions and issues also affected communities here in Canada and across North America. This led to the division of jurisdictions and the emergence of new Orthodox jurisdictions. Today, we have jurisdictions such as the Serbian Church, the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Romanian Church, the Bulgarian Church, the Antiochian Church, the Russian Church, and others. While all of these are Orthodox and united in faith, administratively they are separate. This phenomenon of parallel jurisdictions is not ideal. It would be better if, in one country, all Orthodox Christians were united under one bishop, archbishop, or metropolitan. However, we now have these parallel jurisdictions. What can we do? We must learn to cooperate, to bear witness together, and to avoid the false perception that there are different types of Orthodoxy—Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox—as if they were different religions. In truth, it is one Church, not just for Russians, Greeks, or Serbians, but for everyone to attain salvation through true and full union with Christ. When we say "Orthodox," some people mistakenly think of Jewish Orthodoxy. These are the challenges we must overcome and address.

Otherwise, there will be no mission. The mission will not be convincing to the people of modern-day Canada. Another significant development in the 20th century came from the immigrants who were forced to flee the Soviet Union. Theologians and philosophers who had to leave went to Europe—to France, Germany—and many of them eventually came to North America. They established seminaries, translated numerous books about Orthodoxy, and wrote extensively. They explained the Orthodox faith to people of different backgrounds, including those who were formerly Catholic or Protestant, so that society could become familiar with Orthodoxy and everyone could find their way to the faith. This was a great development that took place during the 20th century. Today, we have Orthodox seminaries in many cities, including New York. Even here in Toronto, there is an Orthodox seminary preparing priests and missionaries to serve in Canada, using English as the primary language to preach the Gospel to locals, to Canadians.

This task is not easy, not only because of the administrative divisions—which, while not a true separation, give people the false impression that we are split into different churches—but also because we live in a post-modern, post-Christian society. Many who used to be Protestant or Catholic have lost their faith and embraced something new, whether it be New Age spirituality or a non-religious lifestyle focused solely on consumption and materialism—what we call mammon. In such a world, in such a society—one that is wealthy overall, a developed capitalist country—overcoming these temptations and this lifestyle requires great strength in faith. Otherwise, people will not be willing to change their lives and abandon the comforts of modern living. The modern way of thinking leaves little room for moral life or serving Christ; instead, it prioritizes serving the ego and mammon. In this context, mission work is challenging.

We must also embrace modern methods of mission, such as the internet, Facebook, and YouTube, and of course, communicate in a language that people understand. There is also a need to reach out to the First Nations, who are marginalized and often live in poor conditions, isolated from mainstream society. These communities face significant social problems, and we must address these issues. We need more missionaries and more people willing to sacrifice themselves to carry out this mission in these areas. Today, there are over 30 parishes in Toronto alone, and there is an Orthodox monastery not far from here. However, this is not enough. We need more. We must also reach out to the growing Chinese, Indian, and Persian communities, as Canada is increasingly a nation of immigrants.

Let us reflect on these things and pray. Please pray for the mission here in Canada, on this Canadian soil. We must remember that the Church is one and united in every place on the planet, in every country. We must continue to carry out this testimony, this ministry to our Lord, to bring more and more people to Him. May the Lord help us, bless each one of you, and may we see you again soon.
