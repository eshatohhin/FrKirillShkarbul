# Evil is it destroying the Church

Dear brothers and sisters, we are still celebrating the view of Mother Mary. This is why we are adorned in blue as a sign of her pure soul, just as the heavens are pure. Today, I want to speak about the evil that exists in this world and within us, because very often we misunderstand evil. I also want to connect this to what is happening in the world now and how we should respond to it.

One person in the comments, a subscriber, once asked me, "What kind of Christians are you? You cannot even tell good from bad, evil from good, Satan from God." Well, it's not what the newspapers tell you that defines evil. So, we are talking about objective evil and how to avoid it.

First, let's address some misconceptions. One misconception is that we sometimes become materialistic, thinking it's all about things, objects, influence, and power. This is why there seems to be no place for evil. What is evil? Is it something illegal? Or what does it mean? It's often seen as just some bad things you do, but this is very abstract and vague.

Another idea is that evil and good are like two opposing powers, similar to the concept of yin and yang in China, where they balance each other like light and shadow. You need one to have the other. However, this gives evil and Satan the same status as God, but it's not so. Evil is not something necessary; it does not have its own status and value.

I will explain what evil is. There is a more occult misconception that evil is just some kind of external power that can come and do something to you, and you can attract that power. This is nonsense; this is superstition. When we talk about evil, we are talking about our own evil and the evil in the world overall. Evil is something that seeks to destroy us. It wants to take our health, our time, our resources, the purity of our soul, and the peace from our hearts. It wants to hurt us, even to kill us, and to destroy the relationships we have with others, especially good, normal relationships. It aims to destroy families, to make us suffer, to be in pain and misery. Who does it target? All people, because they are created by God, and especially those who call themselves Christians or are trying to be Christians. These are the main targets.

So, let's look at some examples. The evil I am talking about, on an individual level, is both internal—our passions—and external—something we encounter in this life. These internal passions, all kinds of desires, like wanting a big, nice house, can lead us to work from morning till night at any job, agreeing to do anything to get the money to pay the mortgage. We lose our health, our psychological well-being, become stressed, have no time for children or relationships, and quarrel with relatives about money and other things. Our hearts are not free; they are enslaved by bills and everything else that comes from our passions.

This is just one example. There are different passions, like depression, which is killing many people, leading them to suicide, causing them to lose their health, and creating all kinds of issues. All these passions are destroying us, stealing from us.

Very often, we hear from people outside the church, from secular people, the opposite. They say the church is going to steal your freedom, brainwash you, make you suffer, turn you into a fanatic, and make you lose years of your life because you cannot do this or that. They claim you will be brainwashed and have to leave behind some so-called stupid values. But this is not the case.

So, they're saying the exact opposite. Why does that happen? Well, it's because the devil is trying to mimic and twist everything upside down. He positions the true, healthy, and free life as slavery, while the true enslavement comes from mammon—from him. When we step onto the path of following Christ, the shackles of mammon are meant to be broken. This is the only thing we will lose, and yes, it may be painful for some people. Perhaps it’s their lifestyle, their business built on sin, sinful relationships, or even aspects of their character that have become ingrained. These things must be let go of.

When you are sick, you need to go to the hospital. In the hospital, you will lose time because you’ll be confined there. You’ll endure treatments that may not be pleasant, take bitter medicine, or even undergo surgery. But if everything is successful—and with the Lord, it must be successful—He is the healer, the doctor. When you leave the hospital, you regain a healthy life. You can do things you couldn’t do before because of your sickness. The same applies to the Church. There is some suffering we must go through, losing things we need to lose, but it is for the purpose of rebirth, true wisdom, and the health of our souls. This is the reality. You may believe me or not, but this is the truth.

Once we step onto this path and discard all the garbage that was holding us back—through fasting, prayer, the grace of the Lord, and union with Him in the Holy Eucharist—we begin walking the path to salvation. You will see that even as this happens, the evil in the world will not become your friend. It will not embrace you. It may tolerate you, but it will not love or support you. There will be no true friendship. This world will find ways to reduce your freedom, your abilities, and your resources. This happens on an individual level, but even more so on a global scale.

When we talk about the Orthodox Church worldwide, we see that the devil is attempting a few things. He tries to divide the Orthodox, to sow hatred among them, and to pit local churches against one another. Sometimes, he succeeds in this. He uses many tools to achieve his goal: politics, nationalistic issues, individual passions, the desire for power, and more. He has a vast arsenal at his disposal.

You might ask, “Why do these Orthodox, who are supposed to be true Christians, lack love for one another? Why aren’t they a model for everyone else?” I tell you that most Orthodox are still striving to walk this path. Many are far from living a firm life in Christ. They, too, can be deceived and fall victim to their passions—including clergy and hierarchs. This is evident in what is happening in the world today.

We can see that many hierarchs, Orthodox faithful, and clergy have been deceived by some form of propaganda—whether it comes from one side or another. They receive this propaganda, believe it to be the truth, and I myself was once like this. I know how difficult it is to break free from that mindset, to step away from it. Sometimes, the Lord must place us in a situation that shakes us out of that way of thinking, that belief in propaganda. We should not be surprised that this is happening, and I can tell you more.

The time we live in is one of advanced technology, but it is not yet at its peak. The brainwashing technology through gadgets and the internet is far more advanced than radio and TV. It works more efficiently, but in the future, it will become even more sophisticated. These methods of hypnotizing, turning people into zombies, and making them believe in something will become even more refined. In the future, when the Antichrist comes, he will be far more successful than he is now. If so many people today—including authors and clergy—are being fooled and misled by propaganda, it will be much worse in those days. He will undoubtedly use methods that are certain and effective, and he will be a genius of manipulation. You might say, "Oh, how scary! What are you saying?" But for those who stand with Christ, there is nothing to fear. The only thing we should fear is falling away from Christ, because then we will be vulnerable. No matter if we are baptized, have a theology degree, or anything else, it will not protect us from being manipulated and deceived by the devil.

So, what should we do? On an individual level, we must put tremendous effort into our spiritual lives, into staying awake, as the Lord said: "Be awake, stay awake, spiritually." This will lead us to a clear understanding of our mission as Christians. We will feel it deeply—that we belong to the Lord. Everything we do, everything that happens to us, every project we undertake, will be about following Christ. This mission will be felt in our hearts, and we will have a clear conscience about it. It won’t just be a superficial "Oh yes, I believe." No, we will truly feel that we are citizens of His kingdom, His followers, His witnesses. Only with such clarity and awareness, maintained daily and at all times, do we have a chance to avoid the deception that is coming—and is already here.

For example, I am part of a group of priests—more than a hundred of us. I see that some are awake and not easily fooled, but others have been deceived, and quite a few at that. It’s not easy to simply tell them, "This is a lie," because they don’t see it as a lie. They believe it to be true, but it is a misconception. Some people say, "Oh, you’re talking about politics. Everyone has a right to their political views. It doesn’t matter; it’s not related to your faith. What you believe is one thing, and your political stance is another." But I tell you, not in the situation we are in now. The current situation is directly related to the unity of the Orthodox Church and the future of Orthodox people on a massive scale. There are now refugees, hundreds of thousands of them, and it will get worse. Something much worse is coming, I tell you.

And if we don’t understand what’s going on, and we support one side in this conflict, calling for more bloodshed, it is not something unrelated to our faith. By doing so, we are destroying the Church and aligning ourselves with evil—yet we don’t see it. We are blinded; we don’t recognize that it is evil. So, let us think deeply about these things. Let us cultivate greater awareness on a daily basis. Where is my spiritual standing? How far am I from the Lord? How much do I need to awaken? How much more must I do to be with Christ, to maintain this union, to keep my faith alive and fruitful? Only then can we avoid the deception that is coming.

We must also be thankful to the Lord for every day He gives us. Mammon wants to consume us, to take away our lives, but the Lord still grants us this time, this freedom. For now, mammon cannot take it away from us. Perhaps, at some point, it will, as it did with the martyrs and the apostles, who were killed because the world hated them and did not want them to exist. But for now, we still have the ability to act, to serve the Lord. We must be grateful and thankful to Him for this. We must place great value on every day we have, on every opportunity we still have to do His work.

May the Lord be with you, giving you strength, strong faith, His blessing, and wisdom. May He keep you safe from all evil, both within and from the outside. Lord, bless us all. Amen.
