# Without a “world view” we go astray!

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about worldview.  
Because now, most people don't have a worldview.  
Modern education is breaking all traditional worldviews.  
It even breaks modern worldviews, like communist or whatever.  
And it doesn't provide another one.  
Another worldview will come—the worldview of the Antichrist—but not yet.  
So now we have this broken situation where everyone is very atomized, and each person  
is only concerned with how something happening in the world might influence their life:  
their business, their income, their family, their security.  
And this is not a worldview—this is not.  

What is a worldview?  
A worldview is when someone is ready to die for something pertaining to that worldview.  
In the past, we had situations where people were willing to die for their homeland, for  
their values.  
Some people would die for revolutionary values, for a new world or whatever.  
They were ready to die for that.  
But now, the majority of people are not ready to die for such things.  
So even when we see something like a worldview being portrayed to us through TV or other media—democracy or something else—this is not really a worldview.  
This is more like a picture, more like a fake.  
The world now is very fake.  
The worldview portrayed to us through the media is basically fake.  
The government is pretty much fake.  
That's why so many actors are involved—it becomes like a drama.  
You need to perform to explain why something happened, but it already happened because someone else made a decision.  
You play the role of a politician and try to present it to the public.  
Not always, but very often.  
The opposition is fake opposition.  
Now we have people who criticize, but they don't address the main problems of the government, and they make life easier for the so-called government.  
It's a fake opposition and a fake government.  
So it's all a show that we see.  

If we want to see reality, we need to get involved in something.  
We need to have firsthand experience if we really want to see what's happening behind these curtains.  
But not many people have that opportunity, and not many people want to get involved in that kind of stuff, which might be dangerous.  
That's why very often we don't know the reality.  
And even if we knew the reality, we would need a very strong worldview to fit that reality, to place that piece of the puzzle into some worldview.  

The task is to gain the worldview of a Christian, which is also not that easy.  
How do we gain this worldview?  
The worldview presented to us by the Holy Scripture is the one we should have.  
This worldview can be seen in two parts.  
The first part is the Old Testament.  
This is a preparation for the New Israel, for the New Testament, for the church.  
We can learn from both.  
We can learn from the Old Testament, any book of the Old Testament, but the one that summarizes the view on history, on what's happening in the world, is Deuteronomy.  
The main message from Deuteronomy is that when the people of Israel stray from God, worship idols, or live in a wrong way, they are punished by God.  
But when they repent, return, and are serious about their faith, they receive blessings, and God helps them.  
This principle is true even now—it still works.  

What is the characteristic of the worldview of the Bible?  
The characteristic is that it is from the perspective of the Holy Spirit.  
This is not a human perspective but God's perspective.  
And, of course, it encompasses events that have happened in this world over thousands of years.  
The Old Testament, the New Testament—thousands of years are all summarized.  
We get the big picture, and this big picture is also from the perspective of God.

So this is the worldview that we need to learn and adopt, adjusting our minds to align with it.  
Okay.  
Today, I won’t be able to cover everything about it—it’s a big topic.  
But what I want to emphasize is the fundamental characteristic of the Christian worldview.  
This is the real worldview as it truly is.  
Okay.  
Because it is God’s view of the world, of the things that are happening.  
And this fundamental property is that the church, the new Israel, the bride of Christ, is at the center of existence.  
Okay.  
At the center of the universe.  
Everything else is secondary.  
Okay.  
Everything else is conditional upon the existence and experience of the church of Christ.  
Okay.  
This is what is crucial for us.  

So we can abandon any other worldview that says, for example, that democracy is the main goal.  
Others might say, no, it’s monarchy.  
Some might argue for the great influence of one worldview or the coexistence of multiple worldviews.  
All of that is political stuff, and it’s not directly related to what we’re talking about.  
Okay.  
Whether it’s America pursuing something, or China, Russia, the Soviet Union—all of those things are secondary to the Christian worldview.  

As long as a country or nation is contributing to the life of the bride of Christ—helping, creating the right cultural, social, and economic environment for the development of faith and the spiritual growth of Christians, the members of the body of Christ—then God blesses it.  
That’s why it’s important, but not the other way around.  
Okay.  
For example, it’s not that the church has to help some country become stronger.  
No, the church is spiritual.  
It’s not about how many buildings we have or how much the church’s budget increases.  
No, it’s about the spiritual growth of the church, its ability to fight against the devil and all the evil in this world.  
This is what God cares about.  
And this is at the center of the worldview.  

For us, it’s important to have this new Israel as united as possible—that we are praying for each other, helping each other, and feeling how this big organism is alive.  
Okay.  
What are the challenges? What are the threats? Where are we going?  
We need to be one and very much united.  
Like the Christians in the early times, who gathered in secret places while Roman soldiers sought to find and persecute them.  
No matter how great the danger, they stayed together.  

This is also one of the goals of the videos I’m making: to bring all people of God, all who love truth and are seeking truth, closer together.  
To unite them and not let them be filled with the garbage and so-called education provided by the media.  
Even journalism nowadays is not neutral.  
It’s not like 60 years ago when news reports simply told you what happened.  
Of course, it wasn’t 100% objective, but it was much more neutral than today.  
Now, it’s targeted at people who don’t have their own worldview, so they need someone to explain what things mean and who benefits or loses.  

We don’t need to rely too much on news, TV, or that kind of stuff.  
We need to have our own worldview.  
We need to educate ourselves.  
May the Lord help us and give us His blessing.  
Amen.
