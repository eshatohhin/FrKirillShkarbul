# if we don’t turn on the switch, we will die

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about what is probably the most important topic in our lives, which is related to the meaning of our existence here, as seen by God Himself. We are concerned about many things: What will happen to the world? When will the next economic crisis occur? What changes will come after the coronavirus pandemic, and many other uncertainties. However, the most important thing is not these concerns. 

Let us turn to the Gospel of Luke, chapter 13, verses 1 to 5. This is what the Lord Himself said: "There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And Jesus answered them, 'Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered such things? I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, no; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.'"

Then the Lord tells the parable of the barren fig tree, which does not bear fruit and will be cut down if it remains fruitless the following year. In this parable, what do we hear? Not just about the coronavirus, but also about tragedies such as terrorist bombings that kill hundreds, or hurricanes in Southeast Asia that claim hundreds of thousands of lives. Now, with the coronavirus, we have seen 2-3 million deaths already. And there are countless other examples. We ask, "What is wrong? Is it a lack of vaccines? Is it something else? Is it a virus from animals?" But no, these are not the main issues. What is important is what the Lord is saying here: unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way, perhaps even tomorrow.

What does this mean? It means that our lives are not inherently significant to the Lord unless we repent. This is one truth. We could die at any moment, and it would not be a big deal to Him if He sees that we are not bearing fruit. Another point is that the Lord is not singling out individuals as worse sinners; He is addressing everyone. Whether it was the Galileans or the people of Jerusalem, the message is clear: most people are not bearing fruit. Many live in their own little worlds, disconnected from God. They are spiritually "switched off." But if you "switch on," you become extraordinarily special in the eyes of the Lord. You become awake, and there are so few people like that—it is truly remarkable.

As Christians, we have two primary goals. First, if we are not yet "switched on," we need to turn that switch on as soon as possible. This is a gift. If it does not happen on its own, we must pray and ask the Lord to grant us the gift of faith so that we may live by it. Once we have this faith, or if we already possess it, we must ensure that the light of our faith remains on every day. It must not be turned off. Every day, we must shine the light of our faith and our testimony—our love for Christ and for others. 

The second important calling from the Lord is to help those around us to switch their lights on as well. This is our mission: to awaken others to the truth and to guide them toward repentance and faith. Let us strive to fulfill this calling with diligence and love.

Everybody is spiritually "off," and we need to help them switch it on. How do we do that? First, we must pray fervently, especially for our relatives and loved ones. We need to pray that the Lord will grant them the gift of faith. At the same time, we must live out our faith authentically, demonstrating through our lives that it is real—not just a set of ideas, but something that transforms us. Faith brings immense value, light, and positivity into our lives and souls. We become spiritually alive, and others need to sense this life in us. They need to feel that we are spiritually awake while they are not, and that there is something missing in their lives that they must address.

The problem is that we are deeply attached to this world. Every day, we are busy running after something—careers, possessions, or other worldly pursuits. But at the end of the day, what have we truly accomplished? Often, nothing of eternal significance. Days, years, and even decades pass by, and we realize that all our efforts have brought us no lasting satisfaction. The devil is a thief, stealing our time, energy, and talents. This is why repentance is so crucial. We must stop and honestly admit, "I was wrong. I invested my efforts in things that are ultimately worthless. From now on, I will live for God. I will pursue Him every day, all the days of my life. The kingdom of heaven will be my top priority. I will live today to discover more about God's kingdom and to see it realized in my heart and in this world."

This must become our way of life. Each of us must become a missionary in this sense. We need to share our faith with everyone around us, without overthinking what to say. The Lord assures us not to worry about our words; the Holy Spirit will give us the right words to speak. Our role is to testify boldly and trust that God will work through us.

We must also remember the true role of the church. Often, we think the church exists to bring us peace and tranquility, to help us cope with life's troubles, stress, and depression. While the church does provide comfort, this is only part of its purpose. The deeper truth is that the church must wake us up. It is sad that many of the most active and influential people in society—those making a difference in economics, social life, or politics—are often not connected to the church. Why? Because Christians are asleep. We mistakenly believe the church's goal is to lull us into spiritual slumber. But no—the church must rouse us to spiritual alertness.

Christ said, "I will give you My peace," but this peace is not spiritual sleep. It is not a passive state where we ignore the world's problems and assume everything will work out on its own. Instead, we must remain spiritually awake, engaged in a daily pursuit of God, striving to grow stronger in faith, and fulfilling our mission to testify for Christ.

Let us reflect on these truths. Let us stop being consumed by the wrong things and honestly admit, "I have wasted my time. From today onward, I will not waste another moment." Acknowledge the past, but resolve to make the future count. Let us live with purpose, awake to God's calling, and committed to shining His light in this world.

The world, influenced by the devil, is constantly trying to steal our time, energy, and health—all for things that hold no value in the eyes of the Lord. As the Lord said, if a tower falls and takes everything you own, none of it will matter in the end. What truly matters is that we turn the spiritual switch on and ensure it stays on. 

Let us ask the Lord to strengthen our faith, to make us bold and capable of sharing His message and the love He has placed in our hearts with everyone around us. May God bless us as we strive to live for Him and fulfill His purpose in this world. Amen.
