# Why Christians become cannon fodder

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen!  
Today I am in Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan.  
Yesterday, we celebrated the Divine Service here, and we are still in the season of resurrection.  
We also commemorated Saint Nicholas of Myra and Dacia, a very great saint.  
We have two major celebrations in his honor: one on May 22nd and another on December 19th, known as Santa Claus.  
Of course, he is a great saint from whom we learn to have compassion for others.  
This is the greatest lesson he teaches us, something we are sorely lacking in today’s world.  

Today, I want to speak about something else that concerns me deeply: how Christians need to avoid certain temptations present in the world today and how these temptations are transforming the world.  
Some of these points I may have touched on in the past, but I want to emphasize them and perhaps bring them together from a single perspective.  

We see that now we are facing war, sickness, epidemics, and perhaps even hunger in some countries.  
We are also dealing with significant economic problems and issues.  
There is a great transformation happening in the world, and I believe its goal is to lead us into a world that is increasingly anti-Christian.  

In this scenario, what is the goal of every Christian?  
I believe the goal is not to contribute to the process of bringing about the Kingdom of the Antichrist.  
Each and every one of us can either contribute to this process or take steps to avoid it, or even bring a greater testimony of Christ’s love in the midst of this transformation.  
This would be a great achievement.  

Even in the worst times, there have been saints who brought about significant change.  
For example, in the 9th century, during a time of great crisis in both the East and the West, including political turmoil, there were saints who made a profound impact.  
I should mention that the crises in Europe during those times were far worse than what we face today.  
The fears people had then were much greater than what we experience now.  
Compared to the devastation caused by wars, pandemics, and other calamities in the Middle Ages or ancient times, our current struggles seem almost like kindergarten.  

Yet, despite all the temptations and problems of those times, we had great saints who accomplished remarkable missions.  
For example, Saints Cyril and Methodius brought the faith to what is now Russia, Ukraine, and other regions, leading many to become Orthodox Christians.  

In our times, each and every one of us can also make a significant contribution to the development of the Church, the faith, and the work of the Lord.  

Yesterday’s Gospel reading was about the Samaritan woman meeting Christ, as described in John chapter 4.  
After this encounter, the disciples brought food to the Lord, and He said, “I have food that you do not know about.”  
They wondered if someone had brought Him food, but He explained, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to accomplish His work.”  

This must also become our mission.  
Our sustenance in life should be to accomplish the work the Lord has given to each of us.  
We need to understand what that work is and remove any obstacles—internal or external—that prevent us from fulfilling it.  
This is our task, our Golgotha, and the purpose of our lives.  
If we grasp this and act on it, we will fulfill our calling.  

So, let us return to the broader context in which we live.  
In these challenging times, let us strive to be instruments of Christ’s love and truth, resisting the temptations of the world and contributing to the advancement of His Kingdom.  

May God bless us all in this endeavor. Amen.

I believe there are two significant temptations that hinder our freedom and prevent us from fulfilling what the Lord calls us to do.  

The first is **individualism**, where we trust only ourselves, close ourselves off from others, and detach from the broader world—whether it be the struggles of different nations, political agendas like communism, capitalism, Marxism, or even ideologies like Putinism. As Christians, we might justify this detachment with good intentions, but the result is that we become isolated. This is the path Protestantism often took, where each person claims, "Only my interpretation of the Bible is the truth," leading to division, conflict, and ultimately becoming tools of the devil.  

When we rely solely on ourselves, we cannot achieve anything meaningful. We become deceived, closed off, and create an imaginary understanding of Christ that is not the true Christ. Our "God" becomes a false god, shaped by our own desires and biases. This is not limited to Protestantism; it can also occur in Orthodoxy and Catholicism when people say, "I have God in my heart, and that's enough. I don’t trust the Church or its teachings." In doing so, they create their own version of God, which is not God at all, and they risk being enslaved by the spirit of the Antichrist. This is unavoidable when we detach ourselves from the community of faith.  

The second temptation is **over-attachment to groups**, such as nations, ideologies, or social classes. For example, in the current conflict between Ukrainians and Russians, if we attach ourselves too strongly to one side, we lose sight of our higher calling as Christians. As someone who is partly Ukrainian and partly Russian, I ask myself: Where is my homeland? Is it Russia or Ukraine? I was born in a time when these were one country. When we attach ourselves too much to our nation, culture, or any ideology—whether it’s a European nation, America’s "city on a hill" mentality, or any other nationalistic agenda—we risk losing our spiritual focus.  

It is natural and good for a Christian to love their country, culture, and traditions, but we must maintain a degree of detachment. Just as in a family, we love our relatives, but when it comes to fundamental questions of faith, we must have autonomy. We do not have to agree with everyone in our family on these matters because our calling from the Lord takes precedence.  

As Christians, we should not be willing to die for a nationalistic agenda or any earthly cause. We are called to be ready to die for Christ and for others—not for political leaders or earthly motivations, but out of love for Christ. If someone’s life is threatened, we should be willing to sacrifice ourselves to save them, not because of their identity or status, but because of our love for Christ. This is the essence of Christianity.  

Similarly, we must avoid attaching ourselves to social classes or ideologies, such as identifying as "rednecks," intelligentsia, elites, or any other group. The class struggle is not our struggle. As Christians, we must rise above these divisions and not become overly involved in such conflicts.  

In summary, the two great temptations we face are individualism, which isolates us and leads to false understandings of God, and over-attachment to groups, which distracts us from our higher calling. As Christians, we must navigate these challenges by remaining rooted in Christ, detached from earthly agendas, and focused on fulfilling the work the Lord has given us.  

May God grant us the wisdom and strength to resist these temptations and live as true witnesses of His love and truth. Amen.

This is why I am recording this video. I believe that too many Christians today are becoming entangled in earthly agendas—whether it’s an information war, a physical war, or some other conflict. They are investing too much effort and even sacrificing their lives for causes that are not aligned with God’s will. In doing so, they become instruments of Satan, who manipulates these conflicts and uses various actors on a grand scale to advance his own kingdom.  

We might think we are fighting for a just cause, but in reality, we are often serving a partisan agenda. Satan thrives on division—whether it’s between liberals and conservatives, nations, or ideologies. He watches as we fight among ourselves, and he reaps the benefits. We must not be part of his game. Instead, we must pray, “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.”  

The plan of the Antichrist is to establish his kingdom, and he wants us to worship it. But what does it mean to worship his kingdom? In the Bible, “worship” means directing all our energy, effort, trust, and reliance toward something. Jesus said, “You cannot serve both God and Mammon” (Matthew 6:24). If we serve Mammon—earthly riches, pleasures, or selfish desires—we become enslaved to sin and Satan.  

The Antichrist’s system will present itself as the source of all benefits, the foundation of life and hope for people. It won’t require overt religious worship, but it will demand total dependence and loyalty. People will live in service to this system, and when the Antichrist himself arrives, they will already be worshiping his kingdom.  

We should not expect the Antichrist to appear suddenly, declaring, “I am God, worship me.” It won’t be that straightforward. His arrival may take years, even centuries, but he is preparing the way. We must remain vigilant, not out of fear, but out of faithfulness to Christ. We should not fear the Antichrist, the rise of digital control, or the societal changes he manipulates. He may influence nations, values, and systems, but he does not have absolute control over individuals—at least not yet.  

We still have freedom of movement, choice, and action. While the world may grow stricter, we are not yet under his complete dominion. We have time—perhaps not in our lifetime, but in the time we are given—to fulfill the mission the Lord has entrusted to us. Completing this mission is our greatest contribution to the fight against evil and the Antichrist’s agenda.  

On a personal level, the devil seeks to defile us through the gadgets we use, the videos we watch, and the social media we consume. He aims to penetrate our minds and change our perspectives. We cannot simply say, “I am Orthodox, I am baptized, I am protected,” and assume we are immune to his influence.  

We must actively guard our hearts and minds, resisting the temptations and distractions of this world. Our focus must remain on Christ and the work He has called us to do. By staying faithful to Him, we can resist the devil’s schemes and contribute to the ultimate defeat of the Antichrist’s kingdom.  

May God grant us the strength, wisdom, and discernment to remain steadfast in our faith and to fulfill His will in these challenging times. Amen.

We see how Orthodox countries are gradually changing, especially in their mentalities. Nations that were part of the so-called "free world" have followed their own paths, often adopting post-modern, post-Christian values, even while still identifying as Orthodox. In the former Soviet bloc, the problem is different. There, people openly rejected faith, and attempts were made to sever their spiritual roots entirely. Even when some later returned to Orthodoxy, their mindset often remained deeply pagan—not just secular, but rooted in practices like astrology, which are inherently pagan.  

This is not a straightforward issue. Each of us must fight for our own salvation and spiritual freedom, resisting these influences. Let us return to the original question of individualism and over-attachment.  

When it comes to attaching ourselves too closely to a social group, nation, or ideology, we must learn to view these things from an external perspective. For example, when we study the history of the Roman Empire, we see its transformations, wars with barbarians, and cultural shifts. We view these events not as participants but as observers, from a distance of 2,000 years. In the same way, we should look at the conflicts and changes happening in our world today.  

Whether it’s wars between nations, political divisions, or cultural shifts, we must avoid identifying too strongly with any side. For instance, we should not think, “I am American, and they are Russians,” or “I am Russian, and they are Ukrainians.” Instead, we should observe these events as if we are outside of them. While we may be externally connected through blood, culture, or economics, we must remember that we are not truly part of these conflicts. As the Lord said, “You are in this world, but you do not belong to this world” (John 17:16).  

This perspective helps us avoid the pitfalls of over-attachment. Just as we study the rise and fall of the Roman Empire with detachment, we should view the events of our time in the same way. This does not mean we are indifferent, but it means we do not allow these conflicts to define us or consume us.  

To avoid individualism, we must remain rooted in the Lord, the Holy Church, the teachings of the holy fathers, and the lives of the saints. Through confession, humility, repentance, and trusting in God’s will rather than our own, we can preserve ourselves in the truth.  

At the same time, we must guard against attaching ourselves to narratives, media outlets, or personalities that promote division. Whether it’s CNN, the Financial Post, Alex Jones, or any other source, we must not allow ourselves to become part of their “camp.” These divisions often serve the agenda of the Antichrist, who manipulates seemingly conflicting groups to advance his kingdom.  

We do not want to contribute to this agenda, even unintentionally. Instead, we must focus on bearing our cross, following Christ, and fulfilling the mission He has given us. May the Lord grant us wisdom, vision, and the strength to resist these temptations.  

May He also fill us with the joy of His resurrection and salvation. Indeed, Christ is risen! Truly, He is risen!  

Amen.
