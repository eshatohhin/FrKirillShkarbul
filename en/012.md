# Liberal or Conservative Where is the Truth

Dear brothers and sisters, our topic today is whether to be a liberal or a conservative.  
Who are we as Orthodox Christians?  
We are going to talk not about cultural matters, nor about political or social issues, but about faith, Christian teaching, morals, and the principles of Christian life.  

We remember the words of our Lord, who said, "This world will pass, but my words will not pass."  
The words of God are absolute; they are absolute truth.  
It is our task to know and discover these words and their meaning, to hold fast to them, not to betray Christ, and to follow Him with all our efforts.  

In the Church, we see some people who are conservative and some who are liberal theologians.  
The term "conservative" often evokes the idea of someone clinging to old principles, perhaps outdated things, simply because they are sacred, because they have been around for many centuries, and thus hold value due to their longevity.  
It may also suggest an unwillingness to change, to adjust to reality, or to approach matters with reason.  
This is the impression many have of the word "conservative."  

On the other hand, liberal theology carries a revolutionary spirit, asserting that what we have now can be discarded because we must respect life as it is today, the needs and character of modern people.  
It argues that we must rid ourselves of outdated practices and adjust to the present.  
There is also another liberal idea that suggests we must return to how things were in the first century, physically replicating the practices of the early Church without regard for anything else.  

Such individuals disregard pastoral needs and the reasons behind certain changes in Church practices and prayers.  
They do not care about these reasons; they simply want to dismantle everything for the sake of an idea, returning to some imagined past practice.  
In doing so, they disregard both the past and the present, dreaming instead of something in the future.  

As Orthodox Christians, our position should be far wiser.  
During the Divine Liturgy, we ask God to preserve us—to guard and protect us.  
It is not to "conserve" us, as if we were relics or antiques to be kept on a shelf.  
Our goal is not to conserve the truth like an old biscuit or an artifact, but to preserve it, to keep it alive, and to allow it to bear fruit in our lives.  
We are called to protect and preserve the truth within the Church, not to fossilize it but to make it vibrant and fruitful.  

We must be careful to discern what the truth is, as there are many interpretations.  
This is why we must look to what the Holy Fathers taught us and examine Church history to understand the pastoral needs that led to certain practices, such as receiving communion after confession.  
What were the reasons behind these practices, and do we still have such needs today?  

There may be room for reform in some Church practices, but reform should not be pursued for its own sake.  
Rather, it should align with the teachings of the Holy Fathers and the truth.  
Unfortunately, many today seek reform for the sake of reform, risking the destruction of the Church entirely.  
This is a very liberal idea.  
In contrast, some adopt a protectionist stance, clinging to what we have now to avoid losing everything in the process.  
This might be a better solution if we cannot undertake reform in the light of the Holy Fathers.  

We also remember that Christ Himself brought a revolution—but a revolution against what?  
It was against sin and darkness.

He brought this revolution, so there should also be a revolutionary spirit within us—but one that protects the truth and makes this truth alive.  
This is our goal as Orthodox Christians. In this sense, we can be considered fundamentalists because we hold to fundamental truths that we are protecting and guarding.  
Of course, we are not going to resort to violence or destruction for the sake of this truth, but we have a fundamental truth that will not change, and we will not give it up.  

Christ Himself said, "You will be my witnesses, and you will be brought before kings and judges, and some of you will be killed for my name's sake."  
We must be ready, therefore, even to sacrifice our lives for the sake of the truth.  
This truth is found in the words of God Himself.  

We should not be willing to adjust to the modern lifestyle or way of thinking that reflects post-Christian, postmodern values, which are now becoming mainstream.  
In ancient times, Christianity stood against the mainstream.  
Pagans and even Jews of that time opposed Christianity, which is why there were such terrible persecutions.  
We must be ready to be persecuted, chased away, and marginalized for the sake of the Lord and His words.  

Let us ask the Lord to give us His wisdom and understanding, to keep us always in the truth.  
"Keep us in Your truth" is one of our prayers.  
The Lord will guide us and give us understanding of what must be preserved and what does not need to be preserved—what is absolute and what is relative.  
May the Lord grant us this blessing.  

One more thing: very often, conservative people are closer to the truth than liberals.  
Those who strive to preserve what we have tend to be closer to the truth because, in our time, we often lack a spiritual understanding of many things, including the reasoning behind certain teachings and traditions.  
When we rely solely on our own reasoning and adopt a liberal approach, we risk being led far astray.  
Those who preserve what we have, even if they seem conservative or somewhat retrograde, often remain closer to the truth than those who do not.  

May God grant us this understanding and blessing, and may He keep us in His truth.  
Amen.
