# Christian view on war. Introduction.

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will record a video talk with our parishioner, Anna. We welcome Anna to our video channel. Anna is currently studying in Taiwan, learning Chinese. We will discuss a topic that concerns many people today: the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 

Hello. Is the Christian Orthodox Church pacifist or not? What is the difference between Christian Orthodoxy and pacifism? 

This is a good question, and many people are asking whether we should support one side or, in fact, whether we are pacifists or not. Should we go to war to protect our country and our people? What kinds of wars, if any, are blessed by the Church? These are questions many are grappling with today.

First and foremost, we must acknowledge that any war is inherently tragic. It results in the loss of lives, immense suffering, and goes against the will of God. God created this world so that people could enjoy life and find Him. However, during war, people cannot enjoy anything. They cannot study, they cannot live peacefully, and hatred spreads everywhere because of fear and suffering. There is nothing positive about war, and that is indisputable.

The question of whether the Church should approve or bless certain forms of war, conflict, or involvement is a very difficult one. Even for the Church, it is a complex issue. We can observe two main tendencies. 

One common tendency today is to support the military, as it is a government function responsible for protecting borders and fulfilling certain needs. As a form of civil service, it is often supported by the Church, which also functions as a civil organization. This view became predominant after Christianity became widespread and the dominant faith in the Roman Empire. During that time, the Church had to cooperate closely with the government, which protected and supported it. In turn, the Church supported the government and its basic programs. This mainstream position of the Church has been questioned, as we must consider what the Church's practice and position were before this alignment.

Before Christianity became part of this large organizational structure, the Church was persecuted and in significant tension with the government, including the official authorities, police, and army. When we read the writings of the Holy Fathers from that time, we find that they did not provide a simple answer to this question. On one hand, they said that if someone was serving in the government, they should not be told to abandon their role. For example, during the time of Christ, some pagan warriors, such as centurions, were praised by Christ. One of them even became a Christian and was baptized by the Apostle Peter. Similarly, when soldiers came to St. John the Baptist and asked, "What should we do? We want to repent. How do we change our lives?" he did not tell them to abandon their service and become pacifists. Instead, he advised them not to treat people unjustly or demand more pay than they were entitled to.

From this, we can see that the Church does not hold a strictly pacifist position. However, many Holy Fathers have emphasized that for a Christian, even witnessing someone being killed is something to be avoided. They must feel a sense of revulsion toward the sin of murder or causing someone's death in war. Therefore, Christians should avoid involvement in conflicts that lead to killing others. Some Church Fathers even stated that Christians should not carry swords. If wronged, they should turn the other cheek.

In summary, while the Church does not take a purely pacifist stance, it emphasizes the avoidance of violence and the sanctity of life, urging Christians to seek peace and justice in all circumstances.

On one cheek, you turn the other, and you do not use force to stop, prevent, or retaliate against evil aggression. Even if someone robs your house, as Christians, you do not seek revenge or sue them. Many people may not like what I am saying, but this was the attitude Christians held in the early days of the Church. They understood this to be the essence of the Gospel. However, most of us today do not live this way. The Church has become more aligned with worldly logic, resembling ordinary people. This shift occurs because we are less eager to follow Christ radically. We seek peace of mind and aim to be good people, thinking, "We are Christians because we attend church and pray." But we do not follow Him with the radical commitment He calls for in the Gospel. This is a significant issue.

I must also emphasize that there is no clear, one-size-fits-all answer. We will not find a definitive rule, such as "No one should join the army" or "Everyone must do this." This is a very individual matter, and you must seek guidance from your spiritual father. You need to reflect on your own situation, your role, and your actions to find the answer. Additionally, we must pray and seek God's guidance to determine whether we are called to participate in a conflict as soldiers or not. In the Old Testament, we see many wars that were blessed by God, where people were called to fight. But do we have that same blessing today? 

Often, if someone is drawn to military pursuits, it may stem from a passion for weapons, adrenaline, or a thirst for action, which is not spiritually healthy. A spiritually mature person should feel inclined to avoid such things unless absolutely necessary. This, in essence, reflects the position not necessarily of the official Church, but of the holy people who embody the spirit of Christianity.

Who is the saintly warrior, and why does the Orthodox Church honor them? This is another important question. People often point out, "You have so many saints who were soldiers or warriors." Does this mean everyone should go to war? There is also a military lexicon in the Church, with references to being vigilant and fighting spiritual battles. However, spiritual warfare and actual warfare are two entirely different things. Being a spiritual warrior does not mean keeping an AK-47 in your house. Instead, it means having a prayer book, the Gospel, and dedicating yourself to constant prayer. These are the tools that will protect you, your family, and your country far more effectively than any weapon.

Returning to the saints who were soldiers, it is important to note that none of them were canonized because of their military achievements. They were not recognized as saints for being good soldiers or for winning battles. There are no saints like that. However, many soldiers in the Roman army, even during times of persecution when Christianity was illegal, were Christians. They were loyal, brave, and responsible, which made them excellent soldiers. They often had successful careers because they avoided the debauchery and immorality common in the Roman army at the time. When they were discovered to be Christians, they were forced to abandon their faith and participate in rituals, such as offering sacrifices to the Emperor or pagan gods like Mars. Their refusal to do so often led to their martyrdom, which is why they are honored as saints. 

In summary, the Church does not glorify war or military achievements but honors those who remained faithful to Christ even in the face of persecution and death. The true Christian warrior is one who fights spiritual battles through prayer, humility, and unwavering faith, not through violence or aggression.

When these soldiers refused to renounce their faith, they became martyrs, often facing brutal deaths. They were considered saints not because of their military service, but because of their love for Christ and their willingness to die for Him. It is crucial to distinguish between these two aspects. 

At one point in Byzantine history, Emperor Nikephoros Phokas wanted to have soldiers who died heroically in battle canonized as saints. He believed their achievements in war were so remarkable that they deserved sainthood. However, despite his efforts to impose this on the Church, the Church firmly refused. This was a significant moment, as it demonstrated the Church's unwavering stance that sainthood cannot be granted based on military achievements alone. 

This historical example teaches us that being a brave soldier or sacrificing one's life in war does not qualify someone for sainthood. As soldiers, individuals must perform their duties to the best of their ability, but as Christians, they have a higher calling: to love God, to sacrifice themselves for others, and to endure suffering rather than inflict harm on others. This is a spiritual achievement, one that requires us to be willing to lay down our lives for the sake of Christ and others, rather than taking lives. 

While military service and Christian responsibilities do not necessarily contradict each other, they are distinct. A soldier can serve their country faithfully while also striving to live according to the teachings of Christ. However, the ultimate Christian calling is to be a peacemaker, not a warrior. 

To conclude, I want to express my hope that the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan will come to an end soon. As Christians, our role is to be peacemakers and peacekeepers. We must promote peace and avoid taking sides in conflicts. Engaging in debates about which side is right or delving into historical grievances only distracts us from our mission. If we become entangled in such disputes, we risk losing our identity as the Church and becoming just another group with partisan interests. 

Our mission is to call for a ceasefire, to encourage people to lay down their weapons, to return home, and to stop the cycle of hatred. This is our goal, our prayer, and our duty as followers of Christ. May the Lord grant us His blessing and wisdom to fulfill this calling. Amen.
