# Conflict bw Christianity & Psychology

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are not in Las Vegas; we are still in our church. However, this is the last video of this year's Christmas season, so we want to bid farewell to this year's Christmas. Today, I want to discuss a topic related to Christmas, as we have been preparing for it for quite some time—a 40-day period of anticipation. This preparation aimed to make our hearts ready to receive the newly born Christ, to welcome Him into our lives. This is truly challenging and not at all straightforward or easy. 

When we look at the state of the world, the spiritual condition is not good. People are not strong in faith. Even those who believe in Christ and strive to follow Him find it difficult to change. We often stumble and face similar problems repeatedly. When we reflect on the ancient saints and martyrs, we are amazed at how they achieved such a high level of spirituality. One of the reasons for this disparity lies in modern psychology and the mindset it has instilled in everyone. 

Now, this is not to completely dismiss psychology or claim that it is useless or harmful. No, there are many important and valuable insights in psychology, and we need to continue studying and researching human personality, behavior, and other aspects. This is important. However, one of the fundamental frameworks of psychology is flawed, and we are all influenced by this framework. This is not a scientific discourse; it affects every one of us, and you will find that this mindset is deeply ingrained within us. We need to change it.

What am I referring to? I am talking about the basic postulate of psychology, which suggests that all the problems you face in family life, personal comfort, career development, and everything else stem from your self-belief or lack thereof. You are told that you need to believe you are the best, that you are capable of achieving great things, that you are very important. If you don't believe this, no one else will. You must proclaim to everyone that you are important, that you deserve your place, and that everyone should recognize you as a leader who can accomplish things. If you don't embody this mindset, you are labeled a loser—someone who lacks self-belief, is weak, plagued by fears, suffers from low self-esteem, struggles to build relationships, and is burdened by stress, despair, and other problems. In short, if you lack self-confidence and self-esteem, you are seen as deficient. 

This framework presents two states: either you are confident and successful, or you are weak and failing. You must choose one, and it must be the former. If you achieve that state, you have everything—it is the gateway to a happy life. We have come to believe this deeply, not just because it is taught in schools, but because it has become ingrained in us. 

Yet, Christ tells us something entirely different. The first beatitude states, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." Who are the poor in spirit? They are those who do not rely on their own spirit, who do not proclaim, "I am John Smith, I am someone special, I am a personality with my own style, values, and character that I impose on everyone." We can sense when someone walks into a room and feel their spirit—their presence, their ego. They might say, "I am someone. I have my experiences, my resume. It shows how special I am. I know this, I know that. I have studied here and there. I am a master, a doctor, or whatever." This is the spirit that fills and fulfills our hearts, but it makes it impossible for us to truly be Christians.

because "blessed are the poor in spirit." This is the first beatitude, which means it is foundational for everything else. Without a humble heart, you cannot attain any spiritual gifts or make progress in following Christ. This stands in direct contradiction to what modern psychology teaches us. 

For us, the issue is not about self-confidence or a lack of it. These are fake problems, artificial concerns. What truly matters is whether we are with God or not. When we are with God, we forget about ourselves. We don’t care about how glorious we appear or how many people know our name or achievements. We care only about following Christ, glorifying Him, understanding His will, and carrying it out. It’s like a soldier in war who has no time for selfies. His focus is on obeying commands, doing his duty as well and as quickly as possible so that the entire army can advance. If he gets distracted by his own ideas or stops to take selfies, he will be killed immediately. This is what prevents us from being true Christians.

Let’s make some comparisons. Secular psychology tells us to take opportunities for ourselves. If you see a chance, seize it, grasp it, and make it yours. The Lord, however, tells us to give ourselves, to sacrifice for others. Secular psychology says, "Be first." Whether in a line, in school, or in your career, you must strive to be the best, to stand out, to have a resume that makes you better than others. The Lord, on the other hand, says, "Be last, for the last will be first, and the first will be last. Whoever humbles themselves will be exalted, and whoever exalts themselves will be humbled." 

Secular culture tells us to promote ourselves, to market ourselves well, to sell ourselves at a high price. The Lord tells us to glorify God, to take the last place, and to humble ourselves. These are completely opposite teachings. Secular thinking encourages aggression, treating life as a war where you must fight to win your bread and secure your place. The Lord tells us to be merciful, to let others take what they want, and to trust that with Him, you will never lose. You will gain far more important things.

Secular psychology says, "Believe in yourself. You can do it. You are capable." The Lord tells us, "You are fallen. You cannot trust yourself. Trust in God. Rely on Him, for He is your Savior. Without Him, you can do nothing." Secular thinking tells us to build a fortress around ourselves—secure insurance, strong relationships, connections, status, and wealth stored in bank accounts or gold. The Lord tells us to store up treasures in heaven, not to worry about earthly possessions, and to trust that we will have what we need.

Secular culture says, "Time is money. Don’t waste your time. If someone is wasting your time, take action." The Lord tells us to sacrifice our time and everything we have for others, for serving Him. Secular thinking emphasizes personal goals as the most important thing. You must be clear about your objectives and pursue them relentlessly. The Lord, however, calls us to set aside our own goals and seek His will above all else. 

In every way, the teachings of Christ stand in stark contrast to the values of the secular world. To be true Christians, we must reject the self-centered mindset that modern psychology and culture promote and instead embrace the humility, selflessness, and trust in God that Christ calls us to. Only then can we truly follow Him and find the peace and fulfillment that the world cannot give.

You need to reach that objective. What is your benefit? The Lord, however, tells us to know the will of God and to do His will, without concern for our own benefit, goals, or objectives. He says, "Understand what I want, and do that." We see a sharp contrast between these two perspectives. Both claim that their approach is essential from the very beginning—without it, you have nothing. 

We can clearly see the anti-Christian nature of secular psychology. It is entirely different from the Lord's message. You may agree with me and say, "Yes, we choose what the Lord tells us. We want to be with the Lord." But if you are honest with yourself, you will discover that even though you agree with these values, your heart is still inclined toward the secular mindset. When it comes to seizing opportunities, getting ahead, or being first, you will find yourself thinking, "I will get it. I will take it." Deep down, we are still trapped in that paradigm. When someone glorifies or promotes you, you will say, "Yes, yes, of course! Please put me in the spotlight." There are countless examples where you will realize that, deep in our hearts, we are still that "old man," driven by selfish desires and worldly values.

If we truly want Christ to enter our hearts, to change us, to fill our lives with Christian joy and blessings, and if we desire to inherit the kingdom of heaven, we must undergo a profound transformation—a change that reaches the very depths of our souls. This is not a superficial adjustment but a complete renewal of our inner being. 

May the Lord help us. May He grant us His blessing, wisdom, and love to change and to follow Him every day of our lives. Merry Christmas.
