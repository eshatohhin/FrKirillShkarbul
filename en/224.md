# Are Christians Infected with a “Gene of Fear”

Dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the exaltation of the Holy Cross, and during these holy days of this feast, I want to share with you some thoughts about fear—about the syndrome of fear or a gene of fear that is implanted into most people, into everyone, actually. The Cross is for us the source of rejuvenation, restoration, and ultimately, the source of resurrection. We draw all the power we need to change from the power that flows from the Holy Cross.

Some people, when they come to believe and find faith in Jesus Christ, change dramatically. The words of Christ have an immense impact. Sometimes they change in the right way, and sometimes in the wrong way, as they may receive false or misleading guidance, leading them to harm themselves and others. Others do not change much; they simply believe. Some have believed since childhood, saying, "I believe in Jesus Christ," but they live just like everyone else. This is another problem. Additionally, there is a common issue where, after some time—perhaps three or four years—even those who changed significantly at first return to their old ways and sometimes become even worse than before, as they now possess new tools for greater sins.

All these things happen, and one of the reasons for these problems is that we fail to recognize our fears. We do not understand that we fear everything except God Himself. Today, I do not intend to delve deeply into psychological analysis or counseling on how to overcome various sins, but I simply want to bring up this issue and reflect with you on the kinds of fears that creep into our subconscious. These fears cling to our character, become part of us throughout our lives, and often grow worse over time, especially with new experiences.

Different generations and different countries have different fears. For example, whether a country was once a colony has a profound impact on the mentality of its people. I recently visited Papua New Guinea, and the impact is significant. Many people still carry a slave mentality. We must recognize that, to a great extent, we are products of our families, societies, and ethnic groups. For instance, in totalitarian regimes, people who have lived under such governments often fear the government and the police, as these institutions are not seen as protectors but as sources of harm and oppression.

In so-called democratic countries, particularly in the West, we see a fading of democracy and basic human freedoms. People are increasingly afraid of various taboos—afraid to speak, criticize, or express their thoughts openly. They fear being labeled impolite or improper, especially concerning minorities or ethnic groups. They fear going against the established framework of what is deemed good or bad. This fear is imposed on them, and they become hesitant to speak truthfully—to call sin what it is, to affirm biblical truths, or to uphold traditional values like "the man is the head of the family." They worry, "What if someone misinterprets me?" or "What if I offend someone?"

Even in personal communication, interactions are becoming increasingly fake, and this fakeness stems from fear. It is not a fear of harming others but a fear of losing opportunities, of being harmed in some way if we say something someone dislikes. We fear losing social standing, approval, or influence. Some people, especially those in the media or with a following, fear losing their fame or social status. We play these games, striving to please others, all because we are afraid of losing something.

So, if there is a prevailing propaganda that everyone is expected to follow—whether it pertains to medical matters (you know what I’m referring to) or political issues—people will often comply and conform to the mainstream trend, even if it contradicts their beliefs. Conformism is a great companion of fear. And, of course, people have economic fears. We all do. We fear losing our jobs, our comfort, or our health. Almost everyone is afraid of talking on the phone these days. More and more, we seek the safety of feeling "right," but when someone calls, we often feel lost, unsure of what to say. It’s a shock. Fear becomes all-encompassing, manifesting in countless ways.

How many people today are sociopaths? Sociopaths fear people; they run away from them. The Lord tells us to be cautious of people—to be wise, not afraid. He warns that if we are too open, others may bring us to trials, synagogues, and even beat us. This is very different from the fearlessness a Christian should have. In fact, you can gauge the extent to which someone is a Christian by examining their fears. Today, we see that even within church hierarchies and bureaucracies, many are afraid of losing their positions. As a result, they say whatever is necessary to avoid criticism. "What are you doing? You’re not supposed to say that!" Even pastors and bishops often fear speaking their minds freely. Seneca once said that a free man is one who thinks whatever he wants and can say whatever he thinks. We are losing this freedom in a big way.

For a Christian, the foundation of fearlessness is the fear of God. It’s not about self-arrogance—thinking, "I have nothing to fear; I’m brave, I’m a winner, I’m a hero." No, it’s the opposite. It’s the fear of God that keeps us from saying or doing anything that displeases Him. We fear mocking, accusing, or gossiping because it harms our relationship with Christ. Yet, we are not afraid of external persecution, losing jobs, or even losing everything. This doesn’t mean we don’t care about our work or our families, but these concerns are secondary to our fear of the Lord. For most people, however, it’s the other way around.

There’s another phenomenon that might appear to be fearlessness but is actually something else entirely: sin. Today, people live with others, frequently changing partners, seemingly without fear. Women engage in free communication with many men, forming relationships without apparent concern. Are they brave? Or is it something else? Similarly, in wars, people kill each other on a massive scale. Is this because they lack fear? Or take revolutionaries and rioters—do they riot because they are fearless? Sometimes, perhaps, but not always.

When it comes to sin, one of the most common examples today is people speaking rudely to their parents or others. Is this a lack of fear? No. It’s a demonic revolt against the law of God. When such a revolt occurs, there is no fear of God. People who defy Him are not fearless; they are driven by a different kind of fear—a fear rooted in a lack of self-esteem or other deep-seated issues. Some commit sinful acts out of passion, such as a love for money or other worldly desires. This is not true fearlessness but a rebellion against divine order. 

In summary, what may appear as boldness or fearlessness in the world is often a distortion, a rebellion against God’s law. True Christian fearlessness is rooted in the fear of God, which frees us from the anxieties of this world while keeping us aligned with His will.

So, when people engage in behaviors like appearing naked on camera or making indecent films, is this a lack of fear? No, it’s not a lack of fear. It’s driven by greed—whether for money, carnal desires, or something else. This is an even greater form of enslavement. They are enslaved by sin and cannot live without it. As the Apostle Paul teaches, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. All these actions that are ugly and lawless are against the law of God. They have nothing to do with the fear of God but are rooted in other forms of fear. 

When it seems like people are brave, outspoken, or even rude—when they appear to have a strong personality—it’s all a façade. It’s a broken, sick personality. Anything that exists without Christ, without God, is sick, ugly, and leads to death and enslavement. 

Let us take this opportunity to examine ourselves. What kind of fears do we harbor? What internal demons have we failed to overcome? Are we afraid of the future, constantly wondering what will happen tomorrow? Do we obsessively read the news, thinking something terrible is about to occur? Are we preoccupied with taking measures to avoid potential disasters? Or do we constantly check our phones, anxious about what’s happening on social media? These are all manifestations of fear, psychological sicknesses that develop when there is no peace from above, when God is absent from our hearts.

Wherever there is addiction or a lack of peace, it’s a sign that we are separated from Christ. When we recognize these fears and anxieties, we must immediately turn to prayer, read the Holy Scriptures, repent, go to church, and receive Holy Communion. These fears reveal an alienation from Christ. Some people fear for their relatives, worrying that something bad will happen to them. Others fear their spouse might leave them. There are countless fears, and all of them show that we lack Christ and do not have the fear of God.

May the Lord help us, grant us wisdom, and give us the fearlessness to face everything in this world. True trust relies on Him, and the fear of God must guide us always and everywhere. Through the Holy Cross, may we find strength and peace. Amen. God bless.
