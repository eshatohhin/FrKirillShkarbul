# Numerology vs. Numbers in the Bible

Dear brothers and sisters, today I want to say a few words about numerology and occultism, which we see increasingly around us.  
For some reason, we notice that certain numbers appear more frequently—for example, 666. In Taiwan, we have train 666, bus 666, and many other things associated with this number. Why is that? I mean, there is no 6-6-5 or 6-5-6—no, not as much. This phenomenon isn’t limited to Taiwan; it has become global.  
Of course, there are other numbers as well—133, 239, 911—many, many numbers that appear too often. People who study this—and I don’t want to delve too deeply into it—there are those who dedicate themselves to understanding these patterns. They analyze codes, geometries, and numbers embedded in people’s names, significant dates, and events. Numerology, astrology, and occultism form a vast and complex topic. If you’re not aware of it, at least you should know that it exists.  

The question is: Why does this exist? Why is it important to some people, particularly those who are very influential? And how is it related to faith and the Bible? Let me be clear: any form of numerology, astrology, or occultism is nonsense—mere superstition. For Christians, this is all rubbish. We do not believe in any of it—no powers, no magic, no spells, no curses that magicians might claim to wield. None of it can harm us.  

In fact, 95% of what magicians claim is fake. However, there is a small portion that is real—they communicate with demons. They may use this communication to achieve certain goals, but they have no influence over those who are with God, who are faithful, guided, chosen, and serving the Lord. Those who pray and seek the Kingdom of Heaven are beyond their reach. At most, these forces can create minor disturbances.  

For example, when we organized large events, such as Christmas gatherings with a significant missionary impact, I witnessed strange occurrences. Demons attempted to disrupt the projects, but their efforts were insignificant and not worth mentioning.  

Returning to the topic of numerology, we see it everywhere, even here in China and Taiwan, where there is a traditional obsession with numbers. People are concerned about zodiac signs, birth dates, and even the measurements of structures. For instance, during the construction of an arch in our previous church, the workers insisted on adjusting the height from 168 centimeters because it was considered an unlucky number.  

Unfortunately, many people live in the grip of such superstitions, believing that the number of strokes in a name or the timing of events can bring luck or misfortune. For us, this is complete nonsense—pure superstition. We do not believe in any of it.  

For example, I once had a passport with the number 666. It expired long ago, and I didn’t care. I didn’t become the Antichrist or serve him because of it. Similarly, I take the 666 train in Taiwan without fear. Nothing happens because I don’t give it power.  

However, we should think more deeply about this. Why are some influential people so obsessed with numbers? And why does the Bible contain references to numerology in certain books? Let’s first address those who are obsessed with numbers—those influential individuals who control trains, newspapers, and more.

Why are they doing this? They are doing it for several reasons. One is that most of them genuinely believe in numerology, occultism, and mysticism. This is part of a gnostic or Kabbalistic mindset—a belief system that attributes power to numbers, symbols, and hidden meanings. We can see how miserable these people are, trapped in spiritual and mental slavery. They live in fear, bound by superstition, and we should pity them for their condition. They are slaves to the devil, confined to a rigid, fear-driven existence.  

For example, they obsess over the hour they wake up, the number of times they perform certain actions, or the significance of specific numbers. This constant fear and obsession make their lives miserable. They live in a box, afraid of everything, and this is the result of their deep-seated superstition.  

Another reason is that they use numbers and codes to communicate with each other. In times of war or crisis, for instance, the news may broadcast one narrative for the masses, but hidden within the details—such as names, numbers, or specific references—are coded messages for those "in the know." These individuals, often part of secret societies or groups, can decipher these messages and understand the true situation. They know that the public narrative is a facade, but the coded messages reveal the real plan.  

This is how they operate. They cannot openly communicate, so they embed these codes in various contexts. There are people who can decipher them, and while we should not fear these practices, we should remain vigilant. We must not blindly trust the media or superficial narratives. The truth is often hidden, and we must be discerning.  

The Book of Revelation instructs us to be aware of such things. It tells us, "Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666" (Revelation 13:18). This is not to make us obsessed or fearful but to remind us to be watchful and discerning.  

However, it is crucial to emphasize that this topic is not of primary importance. Jesus never preached about numerology, numbers, or hidden codes. For us, spiritual life and salvation are about transforming our hearts, living in communion with the Lord, and serving Him. While we can gain some knowledge about these things, they are not central to our faith.  

That said, the Bible does contain instances of numerology. For example, in the Gospel of John, we read about the disciples catching 153 fish (John 21:11). This number has symbolic significance, though its exact meaning is debated among scholars. Similarly, the Book of Revelation is filled with symbolic numbers and imagery—seven lambs, 24 elders, and the three and a half years of the Antichrist's reign, to name a few.  

While these elements are intriguing, they are not the focus of our faith. Our primary concern is our relationship with God, our spiritual growth, and our mission to serve Him. Numerology and hidden codes may exist, but they pale in comparison to the transformative power of the Gospel and the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.

This is all symbolic, and we should not take it literally. For example, the "three and a half days" or "three and a half years" mentioned in Revelation represents half of seven. Seven symbolizes fullness, completion, or perfection, so half of seven signifies incompleteness, limitation, or something cut short. This tells us that the reign of the Antichrist will be relatively brief. We don’t know exactly how long—perhaps 10 years, 20 years—but it will not last forever. This is a crucial message: the Antichrist’s rule will be cut off unexpectedly, and his plans will not come to full fruition.  

This symbolism gives us great encouragement. It reminds us that no matter how dark or oppressive the times may seem, the reign of evil is temporary. We can endure, withstand, and remain faithful, knowing that God’s ultimate plan will prevail.  

Similarly, other symbols in Revelation, such as the lion, carry dual meanings. In the Bible, a lion can represent both Christ, the Lion of Judah, and the devil or the Antichrist. The same image can convey different messages depending on the context. This is why we must not jump to conclusions or fear symbols without understanding their deeper meaning. For instance, some people see a lion in a logo or a name and immediately associate it with the Antichrist. This is a mistake. Symbols require context to interpret correctly.  

We should not be afraid of symbols, codes, or numerology. Instead, we should approach them with discernment, seeking to understand their meaning within the broader context of Scripture and God’s plan. The symbols and numbers in Revelation and other biblical books are not of principal importance. While they can provide insight into God’s mysteries and plans, they are not essential for our salvation. Whether we fully understand the meaning of a lion, a bear, or a specific number does not determine our relationship with God or our eternal destiny.  

What matters most is our faith, our obedience to God, and our commitment to living according to His will. The symbols and numbers in Scripture are there to guide, encourage, and warn us, but they are not the foundation of our faith.  

That said, God can use numbers or other signs to give us hints or encouragement. For example, when I traveled abroad to bring the relics of Saint Martyr Abacus to Taiwan, I noticed that the day I arrived coincided with the feast day of Saint Prophet Habakkuk. This was not a mere coincidence; it felt like a sign from the Lord, a hint that He was blessing our efforts and that Saint Prophet Habakkuk was interceding for his spiritual child, Saint Martyr Abacus.  

Such moments can strengthen our faith and remind us of God’s presence in our lives. They are not meant to be overanalyzed or turned into superstitions but rather to serve as gentle reminders of God’s care and guidance.  

In conclusion, let us remain vigilant and discerning, but not fearful or obsessed with symbols, numbers, or hidden meanings. Our focus should always be on our relationship with God, our spiritual growth, and our mission to serve Him. The symbols and numbers in Scripture are tools to deepen our understanding, but they are not the essence of our faith. Let us trust in God’s plan, remain steadfast in our faith, and find encouragement in the knowledge that His promises will always prevail.

We should not become overly obsessed with signs, numbers, or similar things. However, there are moments when such occurrences bring us peace, consolation, encouragement, or strengthen our faith—these may indeed be gentle reminders from the Lord. On the other hand, if we find ourselves fearful, overly cautious, or preoccupied with trivial details—such as how many times we perform an action, the exact time we leave the house, the height of a door, or the significance of a date like Friday the 13th—we must remember that these things do not matter. We should simply focus on doing what needs to be done, trusting in God’s providence and not giving undue attention to superstitions.  

Let us pray for the Lord’s guidance and wisdom, asking Him to protect us from all evil and to thwart the plans of the devil. Through His strength, we can stand firm, bring testimony to His name, and glorify Him in all that we do.  

May the Lord bless each of you and guide us in our mission. God bless.
