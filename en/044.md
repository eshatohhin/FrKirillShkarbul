# Our ideas about God are upside down

Dear brothers and sisters, today we are changing the background.  
I am on the shore of the Pacific Ocean in Taiwan.  
The weather is beautiful.  
With this change, I want to talk about change itself—specifically, a change in our perspective toward God, toward the Church, and toward the commandments.  
This is because our views, and the views of most people, are exactly reversed.  
They are completely different from reality.  
We think we understand, but the message we’ve accepted is one that the devil has imposed on everyone.  

He was able to impose this because, when people broke their relationship with God after Adam’s fall, they became like the fallen angels.  
Fallen angels are still angels, but their will and the direction of their lives are completely opposite to what God intended.  
Everything about them is the opposite of how God created them to be.  
A similar thing happened to humanity.  
This is the essence of the world we live in.  

What am I talking about?  
I’m talking about the feeling many of us have that God will take away our freedom.  
We think, “If I go to church, the Church will tell me I can’t do this or that. It will limit my freedom. It will make me suffer. I’ll have to kneel, fast, and cry over my sins. I’ll be miserable.”  
We believe that God and religion are about punishment, severity, and restriction.  
That’s why we resist.  
We say, “I want a free life. I want to eat what I want, whenever I want. If I want to eat sausage on a Friday, I’ll eat sausage. If I wake up in the middle of the night craving sausage, I’ll eat it. I want this freedom.”  

But this is not true freedom.  
True freedom comes when we have a choice.  
Today, I can eat sausage—no problem. I can eat meat or anything else. I can choose to eat, or I can choose not to eat.  
This is what God and the saints teach us.  
True freedom is the power to choose.  
Without this freedom, we are enslaved by a commander living inside us—our desires, our “belly.”  
Call it mammon, call it the “old self,” the “old man” within us.  
This old self is demanding.  
It says, “Go eat that sausage,” and we obey.  
We think it’s what we want, but it’s not.  
It’s our desires commanding us.  
That’s not freedom; that’s slavery.  

Some people think the Church imposes conservative, traditional values that limit their perspectives.  
They believe this will make them suffer or turn them into fanatics.  
But this is a mistake.  
It’s a mistake because we have a wrong understanding of God.  

Okay, let’s continue.  
There are some planes flying above me.  

Without God, without His grace, we are unfree.  
We become trapped in our own limited selves, confined to the cell of our minds and the values we were raised with.  
This is not freedom.  
This is why we sometimes seek to learn from others who seem interesting.  
But who is the most interesting of all?  
It is God Himself.  
He is the source of all wisdom, the most brilliant and genius being imaginable.  
He can open our minds, give us true vision, and reveal the future, ourselves, and many mysteries.  
He allows us to penetrate the depths of His truth.  

Yet, we are afraid.  
We think, “If someone tells me something unpleasant, I’ll get offended. I might scream, swear, or feel bad.”  
This is unfreedom.  
If we are with God, we have a choice.  
We can still scream, get angry, or become distracted, but we also have the choice not to.  
We can choose to bless instead, to say, “Thank you for this negative feedback because it humbles me.”  

This is true freedom—the ability to choose love, humility, and grace over anger and pride.  
Let us seek this freedom in God, for only He can set us free.

We have true freedom with Christ, and that is where freedom—real freedom—comes from.  
We often carry bad memories about someone, and we can’t let them go.  
This is also unfreedom.  
Our old self tells us, “Just stay in bed today. Don’t go anywhere.”  
We become lazy.  
We play video games or watch meaningless videos.  
This old self tells us, “Eat sausage all day, play computer games, watch stupid videos.”  
And we obey.  
Without Christ, we have no choice but to obey.  
Only with Christ do we have a choice.  

Yes, I have the choice to stay in bed and do nothing all day, but I also have the choice to do something meaningful—to study, to help others, to engage in something truly important.  
With Christ, we have that choice.  
That is where freedom comes from.  

This old self tells us, “God is not on your side. Don’t trust Him. He will trick you.”  
It convinces us not to love others but only ourselves.  
This is unfreedom.  
When you only love yourself because you want to feel protected, to have a full belly, to avoid suffering, that is not freedom.  
You live in fear—fear of coronavirus, fear of the future, fear of economic collapse, fear of your relatives getting sick, fear of losing your job.  
You are afraid, and that is unfreedom.  
Where is freedom when you are consumed by fear?  

With Christ, with God, there is no fear.  
That is where true freedom comes from.  
The old self tells us, “Don’t go to church. Unless things get really bad, God doesn’t care.”  
But the truth is, God wants your life to be good.  
Yet, you choose to live without Him, and things get worse and worse.  
Then, when things are at their worst, people say, “I’ll go to church, light a candle, and pray a little.”  
But it’s not enough to just visit, light a candle, and expect everything to be fine.  
By then, it’s often too late.  

We’ve made so many mistakes, done so much wrong.  
We need to establish a real relationship with God.  
We need to repent wholeheartedly and ask Him to heal us.  
This takes effort.  
We must truly put in the effort to change our lives, not just light a candle and walk away.  
We need to open the Gospel, read it, and let it transform our worldview.  
That is what’s important.  

But the old self tells us, “Don’t do it. Wait. Maybe one day you’ll feel inspired.”  
I tell you, that inspiration will never come from the old self.  
It will only tell you to stay home, play games, and eat sausages.  
That is unfreedom. That is slavery.  
And in the end, your whole life is wasted.  

People wonder, “What happened? Everyone is gone. No one loves me. I’m alone, lonely, and depressed.”  
That is unfreedom.  
The devil steals your time, your energy, and your resources.  
That is his task.  
He deprives you of everything and makes you think it’s freedom.  
But it’s not freedom—it’s suffering, slavery, and idolatry.  
Mammon is a false god, a demanding idol.  
It exploits you like a harsh boss, taking everything from you—your time, your energy, even your eternal life.  
The devil wants you to suffer forever.  

This is what happens to those who refuse to trust God, who are unwilling to take the step toward Him.  
So let us change our worldview.  
Let us trust that God is our Father.  
He wants us to be with Him.  
He doesn’t want us to suffer.  
He wants our lives to be full of happiness, wisdom, and success.  
We are His children, and He truly wants us to grow, thrive, and be happy.

Let us cast aside this selfishness, this reliance on earthly things, this endless craving for career advancement, wealth, and material success.  
Let us throw these things away and choose the Lord instead.  
Let us choose to be with Him, to walk in His light, and to live according to His will.  

May the Lord guide us on this path, giving us the motivation and strength to follow Him.  
May He grant us true freedom, teach us His wisdom, and open our eyes to see things as they truly are.  
May the Lord bless each one of us and grant us success—not as the world defines it, but as He does.  

As we enter this new year, may we grow closer to Him, deepen our faith, and live lives that reflect His love and truth.  
May the Lord bless us all. Amen.
