# What means “we have the mind of Christ”, and how to look spiritually on earthly matters

Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen.  
In recent times, we have discussed some of the problems of this world, including war and sickness. It is important to recognize where the line lies—where we might slip into politics and earthly matters, and where the spiritual discourse begins. To make this distinction and avoid veering into politics or other distractions, we need to focus on what it means to have the mind of Christ.  

Very few commentators today directly explain these words. A significant issue is that some people believe the Lord cannot change our minds—that our minds are our own. This perspective stems from Protestant theology. Today, however, we will not delve into theology. Instead, we will explore the difference between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of this world. We will see that the powerful and mighty rulers of this world know nothing of God's wisdom.  

Let us turn to the words of the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 2. I encourage you to read the entire chapter. At the beginning, he says:  
*"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."*  

Paul knew that these people were pagans with many questions about humanity, the design of the world, its origins, philosophy, wisdom, and other matters. Though Paul was highly educated and knowledgeable, he chose to speak only of Jesus Christ and His crucifixion. He did not want to distract them with other topics; he wanted them to remain focused.  

This is why, when I create these videos, I always ask myself: Is this related to our faith in Jesus Christ? If it is not—if it is merely a political matter, an ideology, or something else—I do not concern myself with it. I abandon such topics because they are not my focus.  

Paul continues:  
*"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."*  

Paul explains that we can discuss the wisdom of God. From a spiritual perspective, we can address any topic because we see it through another dimension. This world does not operate solely by its own laws and wisdom, leaving us with nothing to contribute. On the contrary, we can understand everything that is happening. However, our wisdom and judgment come from a higher level—a level that the most educated, powerful, and technologically advanced individuals of this world cannot comprehend. They do not understand because they do not follow Christ. They have not chosen Him as their Savior.  

This means that all their philosophies, wisdom, and achievements—no matter how impressive—are flat and meaningless to the Lord. In fact, they are garbage. As Paul writes earlier in 1 Corinthians 1:20-21:  
*"Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."*  

The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. He understands it all, but it holds no value. It is tasteless and empty. Therefore, no matter how many degrees someone holds, whether from Harvard, a Nobel Prize, a Guinness World Record, or access to immense computational power—it means nothing to the Lord.

Because they possess all the power, rule the world, hold degrees, and have access to education—and there are also secret societies like the Freemasons, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, and other powerful organizations—they appear to be incredibly mighty. These individuals seem to have everything: knowledge of economics, politics, data on everyone, and more. They are like super-minds, ruling the world with their vast resources and influence. Yet, to the Lord, all of this is garbage. It is nothing, because it is flat and devoid of the wisdom of God.  

Heavenly wisdom is immeasurably above earthly wisdom. So, what is this spiritual wisdom all about? That is the first question. The second question relates to those mystics, secret cults, and occultists who rule the world today. We see their signs everywhere—hidden numbers, symbols, and references to Kabbalah, Blavatsky’s teachings from Tibet, Shangri-La, and other secret knowledge. Are these individuals truly as wise as they claim to be?  

Let us address the first question: What is this spiritual wisdom that the Lord teaches? In 1 Corinthians 2, we read:  
*"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."*  

We receive the Holy Spirit, and through Him, we are able to discern spiritual things. To do this, we must believe in Christ, follow Him in everything, and strive to become more like Him—humble in spirit. As Jesus said, *"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"* (Matthew 5:3). When we take up our cross and follow Christ, we draw closer to Him. Even if we are uneducated by worldly standards, we gain wisdom from the Lord.  

Now, let us consider the political agenda unfolding in the world. From a worldly perspective, people analyze motivations and benefits: What does China want? What are America’s interests? What drives Russia, Ukraine, corporations, or other actors? They examine mutual value, resources, and strategies. This is all flat and superficial. While such analyses exist, the deeper reasons and meanings lie in the spiritual realm.  

For example, a leader’s motivation might appear to be glory, power, money, or resources. Perhaps they seek safety, protection, or personal gain. Others are driven by ideas—socialism, nationalism, the vision of a "Great Turkey," Islam, or other ideologies. While these motivations may seem complex, they are still flat in the eyes of the Lord. They are part of the wisdom of this world, which is foolishness to God.  

The wisdom of God transcends all of this. It is not about economic progress, oil prices, or political strategies. It is about understanding the deeper spiritual realities that govern all things. Those who follow Christ and receive the Holy Spirit gain access to this divine wisdom, which the rulers of this world cannot comprehend. No matter how powerful, educated, or influential they may seem, their wisdom is meaningless without the Spirit of God.  

In conclusion, the wisdom of this world—whether it comes from secret societies, powerful leaders, or intellectual elites—is ultimately empty. True wisdom comes from God, revealed through His Spirit to those who humble themselves, take up their cross, and follow Christ. This heavenly wisdom is immeasurably greater than anything the world can offer.

If we discuss matters only from the perspectives I mentioned earlier—such as political motivations, economic benefits, or personal gains—it means we are operating on a completely earthly, worldly level. There is nothing spiritual in such discussions. However, when we delve into deeper matters that pertain to Jesus Christ, His teachings, and divine revelation, we enter the spiritual realm.  

Let us continue with the Apostle Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 2:14-16:  
*"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."*  

Why is it often so difficult to grasp spiritual truths? Why do they seem abstract, boring, or irrelevant compared to tangible matters like economics, atomic bombs, or new weapons? This is because the natural, fleshly mind cannot comprehend the things of the Spirit. The flesh cannot understand or listen to what the Spirit is saying. This is why so few people may follow this channel or engage with spiritual discussions—they find them impractical or too abstract.  

Verse 15 explains that the spiritual person can judge all things, yet they themselves cannot be judged by others. A spiritual individual understands why certain events occur and why people are motivated in specific ways. However, those who are not spiritual cannot judge or understand the spiritual person’s actions. They might try to analyze the spiritual person’s motivations using worldly logic—thinking, "What is their gain? What benefit do they derive from this?" But they cannot penetrate the Spirit of God.  

The spiritual person is driven by the Spirit of God, and no one can fully comprehend or judge that. As Paul concludes, *"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."*  

This brings us back to the question I raised at the beginning: What does it mean to have the mind of Christ? It is not an easy question to answer. Having the mind of Christ does not mean we possess the same omniscience, power, or abilities as Christ. We are not as knowledgeable or capable as He is. If that were the case, we would perform miracles, resurrect the dead, walk on water, and communicate directly with God the Father as Jesus did. I have yet to meet anyone who can do these things.  

Instead, having the mind of Christ means aligning our thoughts, desires, and actions with His will. It means seeing the world through His perspective—valuing what He values, loving what He loves, and rejecting what He rejects. It means being guided by the Holy Spirit, who reveals the deep things of God to us. While we may not fully understand or possess the mind of Christ in its entirety, we are called to grow in spiritual wisdom and discernment, becoming more like Him every day.  

In summary, the wisdom of this world is limited and flat, but the wisdom of God is profound and eternal. By seeking the mind of Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to guide us, we can transcend earthly perspectives and enter the spiritual realm, where true understanding and purpose are found.

Having the mind of Christ means we are aligned with His will and purpose, operating on the same spiritual wavelength as Him. This alignment is not about achieving worldly success, holding prestigious positions, or possessing vast knowledge. Rather, it is about becoming pure in heart, bearing our cross daily, and learning what it truly means to follow Christ in our lives. Even if our lives seem small and simple by earthly standards—perhaps we are not presidents, CEOs, or highly educated individuals—we can still possess the mind of Christ.  

When we are driven by the Spirit of God and allow Him to instruct us in our daily lives, we gain the ability to make right decisions and discern things correctly. We will not be misled or deceived by the Antichrist or any other falsehoods. This is why we pray, *"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one"* (Matthew 6:13). This is our task—to strive for holiness, to become saints. Every person who sets this goal will eventually gain the mind of Christ. However, many people set other goals, such as material well-being, power, or fame, and in doing so, they drift far from the Lord, the Spirit of God, and divine wisdom.  

Now, regarding the occultists and those who wield great earthly power—those who hide their signs everywhere, using numbers like 3, 17, or 666, colors, and Masonic gestures (which I will not demonstrate here, as they are rooted in satanic influences)—they believe they possess secret power. They think they are in communication with some higher force, ruling the world while viewing humanity as mere pigs, dogs, or a herd to be exploited. They see themselves as the "illuminated ones," the elite who are above the masses.  

This mindset comes from the devil, who seeks to mimic God. The devil knows that the wisdom of God exists, but he cannot access it. Instead, he creates a counterfeit—a surrogate or copy of divine wisdom—to attract those who desire power, influence, and control in this world. He seduces them into becoming like him: vain, proud, and devoid of love for God and others. This is a perverted imitation of the divine wisdom and mysteries of God.  

When people step onto this path, they become completely inverted, worshipping false gods like Saturn and embracing a distorted logic. This is what happened during the time of Christ, when the religious leaders reasoned, *"It is better for one man to die than for the whole nation to perish"* (John 11:50). They used earthly logic to justify their actions, failing to recognize the deeper spiritual reality at play.  

In conclusion, the wisdom of this world—whether it manifests through occult practices, secret societies, or the pursuit of power—is a counterfeit of the divine wisdom found in Christ. Those who follow this path are deceived by the devil, who seeks to lead them away from God and into darkness. As followers of Christ, we must remain vigilant, seeking the mind of Christ through humility, obedience, and a life led by the Holy Spirit. Only then can we discern the truth, resist deception, and walk in the light of God’s wisdom.

What this meant, of course, was not that they understood God’s plan of redemption. No, they simply refused to follow the Messiah, who proclaimed humility, taking up the cross, enduring suffering, and turning the other cheek when struck. They reasoned, *"If everyone becomes like that, we will be overrun. Robots will conquer us, and we will be overwhelmed."* This was their earthly wisdom and logic. They saw Christ’s teachings as a path to failure, believing it would strip them of power, influence, and a future. Their solution was to eliminate Him, thinking, *"If we kill Him, we can grow stronger, gain more finances, more power, and achieve our goals. The real Messiah will come later."*  

Why did they think this way? Because they did not trust God. They did not understand the wisdom of God—that He holds the highest wisdom, possesses all power, and governs the world according to His will. They failed to acknowledge the supremacy of God’s wisdom, and this is why they crucified Christ. From this, we can see that the logic of this world is garbage in the eyes of the Lord. It may have its own attractiveness, its own logic, and its own "truths," but to God, it is all fake, relative, and foolishness.  

Therefore, we should not be afraid. We should not be intimidated by those who appear super-smart or wield great power—whether they are occultists, rulers, or members of secret societies. If they do not have Christ, if they do not follow Him, they lack true wisdom. Their projects will ultimately fail, and the Lord will overthrow all their schemes. Even if we are not highly educated or influential by worldly standards, the Lord will be with us. His blessing will be upon us, and He will accomplish His plan.  

There is more I could say on this topic, but it would be too much for one video. Instead, let us reflect on these truths. Let us not be afraid. Let us learn how to gain the Spirit of Christ and follow Him daily, ensuring we remain firmly on this path. Let us seek the true wisdom that comes from the Lord.  

May our Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrected Messiah, be with each of you. May He guide you, grant you the gift of spiritual wisdom, and fill you with the joy of His resurrection.  

**Christ is risen! Indeed, He is risen!**
