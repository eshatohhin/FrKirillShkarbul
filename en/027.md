# How what we see effects our soul

Dear brothers and sisters, today we will talk about a very important topic: how our eyes and what we see can influence our internal world, our heart, and the health of our soul. We will begin this topic with the words of Christ. In the Gospel of Matthew 6:22, He said, "The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is clean, simple, or pure, the whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is wicked or sick, then the whole body will be full of darkness."

What does this mean? First, the literal meaning must be established. The literal meaning is related to the vision theory that was predominant in Israel at that time. The understanding was that the eyes are like a lamp or a torch, which make it possible for you to see the objects around you. Just as a torch in the darkness allows you to see objects, the Jewish people believed that the eyes are like a lamp, shining and enabling you to see everything clearly. This was the thinking at the time, which differs from modern understanding. However, we should not be overly concerned about this. 

Having understood this, we need to explore the deeper meaning that Christ is conveying through these words. He is not merely discussing these ancient theories, which were common knowledge at the time. Instead, He is using this imagery to convey a more profound message. This message has two levels. Today, we will focus on the first, more basic level, and begin to touch on the second level, which is even more significant.

The first level pertains to physical vision—what we see. We often think that when we see something, we simply receive information and then move on to something else, acquiring new information. However, it doesn’t work that way. What we see lingers within us. It’s like music: sometimes we hear a song, and it keeps playing over and over in our minds. Similarly, what we see enters into us and continues to run within our hearts and subconscious minds. It remains there, at least for some time, and this can lead to sickness. 

We know that much of what we see is harmful—it’s garbage, it’s dirty. Yet, we see it, and it becomes part of us. Then we wonder why we feel weak, why we lack motivation, why there’s bitterness in our hearts, even when we don’t seem to have many problems at the moment. We feel down, low, and unwilling to do anything, and we don’t understand why. This is a symptom of this sickness. 

Compare this to ancient people. They may not have seen as much as we do today. They moved around more, but their surroundings were often the same—trees, nature, and so on. In contrast, modern people are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information through TV, smartphones, computers, movies, and more. We take in so much information—perhaps 100 times more than people in ancient times. Yet, we wonder why we feel so burdened. By absorbing so much into ourselves, this sickness may be far worse for us than it was for them. This might also explain why there were more composers, poets, and creative individuals in the past than there are today. 

This suggests that we need to protect ourselves. We must guard our vision. The holy fathers advise us to be mindful of what we see. Don’t give in to curiosity and try to see everything. Sometimes, our curiosity can be harmful. We don’t have a vaccine or protection against the negative effects of what we see, so we must create that protection for ourselves. 

It’s important to remember that only Christ can truly heal these sicknesses. It’s not as simple as taking a walk and seeing flowers to make everything better. Sometimes, the harmful effects linger like a virus within us. Let us be mindful of this and take steps to guard our vision. 

Another important meaning, closely related to this physical aspect, is that our soul and heart can also bring about many challenges.

...of thoughts, ideas, and desires. These things can also make us live in darkness, in shadow, because they block the light of God within us. This relates to our internal eyes. Many Church Fathers, when discussing this passage in the Gospel, emphasize that the primary meaning is this: we need to guard our internal eye and avoid any thoughts, desires, or temptations that draw us away from God. This is crucial because a "simple" or "pure" eye means one that is free from sickness or evil—no grudges, no selfishness, no jealousy, no accusations. It refers not to the physical eye but to the eye of our soul or mind, which in Greek is called the *nous*. 

This spiritual eye must be clean and open. To determine whether it is healthy and pure, we can observe whether it draws us closer to Christ. The more simple and pure our spiritual eye is, the more we see Christ, the more we are attracted to Him, and the more we desire to pray to Him. If this does not happen, then darkness resides within us. We might think we have light, but in reality, it is darkness. 

In everyday language, we often say, "I see," meaning "I understand." We use this language, borrowed from physical experience, to describe our mental clarity. We might think, "I am smart; I understand things clearly. I can see what you mean." We might believe this clarity is a form of light within us. However, Christ warns us that if the light we think we have is not leading us to Him, it is actually darkness—and how great that darkness is! This darkness keeps us away from God. 

We must be mindful and careful in this situation. If we think, "I’m okay; I have some light in me," but that light does not draw us to Christ, then we remain in evil and darkness. Therefore, let us reflect on these two meanings today: guarding both our physical eyes and what we see, as well as the eyes of our soul. May God help us in this endeavor and grant us His abundant blessings.
