# New Year’s reflection and encouragement

Dear brothers and sisters, today is most likely the last video of this year, 2020, and it is a good time for us to review our lives, to draw some conclusions about what we have done, what the Lord has given us during this past year—both good and bad—and to thank Him for all of it. It is also a time to reflect on where we are and where we are going.  

When we consider what is happening in the world and in the Church, we will see that we are under attack from the devil, one blow after another. This pandemic, along with many other challenges, has left society weak and demoralized. People are tired of everything because of these ongoing crises. Many are depressed, losing patience, while others have become complacent. With no work or studies, some have grown reluctant to return to their former routines. There are numerous social problems, and the Church, too, is under attack. It is being accused of being against humanity, of not complying with measures, and there is turmoil within the Church itself—divisions, conflicts, and all kinds of issues. It may even get worse next year.  

Why is all of this happening? Because we are spiritually weak. The prevailing mindset today is to simply enjoy this life, to spend our time in ways that bring us the most utility or pleasure. But this is not the Christian way of looking at things.  

The Christian perspective is to see ourselves as ministers and soldiers of Christ. As soldiers, we must hold ourselves to high standards. We need to be self-critical, self-disciplined, and set clear goals. For example, we might aim to spend 80% of our time and energy on activities that directly serve God—such as prayer, labor, self-education, reading the Holy Scriptures, studying the writings of the Church Fathers, conducting research, or writing. The remaining 20% can be spent on rest, but even this should be done in a Christian manner.  

This 80% of effort is not always pleasant. Just as going to the gym and training is not always enjoyable—it can be tiring and demanding—so too is the work of spiritual growth. When we study, much of what we learn may not be immediately enjoyable, but we know it is necessary. Similarly, we should not expect constant pleasure from the 80% of our time dedicated to serving God.  

This is especially important during this pandemic, when people spend so much time at home with ample leisure. Many have become spiritually weak, and this is exactly what the devil wants. When we are weak, he strikes us repeatedly, and we find ourselves merely reacting, defending, and lacking the spiritual strength to fight back or drive him away.  

This is what Christ expects of each of us: that we become spiritually strong and take up the role of soldiers. Today, I want to invite the Apostle Paul to speak, as he can express this far better than I can. Let us turn to Ephesians chapter 6, verses 10 to 19. I will read and comment on these verses.  

"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."  

This is the goal we must set for the coming year: to stand firm against whatever the devil may bring, and not just to stand firm, but to strike back and drive him away.  

"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places."  

This translation could be improved: it refers to the spirits in the air, the evil spirits. Our battle is against them—spirits of laziness, fear, and all kinds of other malevolent forces. We are called to chase them away, for this is the nature of our spiritual warfare.

"Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."  

This means we must endure, overcome all challenges, and remain steadfast. We must not break but stand firm. "Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness."  

We must strive to live righteous lives, free from blemish—in our behavior, mindset, hearts, and words. When we are untainted, we gain the strength symbolized by the breastplate. "And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace."  

We must be ready to preach the gospel at any time, in any place, to anyone.  

"Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one."  

Faith is our greatest power. It is not merely believing in something; it is a supernatural force that shields us from temptations, trials, and tribulations. "And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."  

The word of God is our sword. We must study it daily, keeping our hearts rooted in the Gospel and Scripture. This is our goal. We should not wait for a special feeling or moment to engage with the Word. Our old self will always seek comfort and relaxation, offering endless excuses to avoid spiritual discipline. But we must act like disciplined soldiers, doing what we know we ought to do without hesitation.  

As Christians, our responsibility is to take up these ministries without waiting for perfect conditions. We should not say, "I’ll have time after I finish everything else." Instead, we must establish a disciplined routine, dedicating time each day to prayer, study, and service. Whatever extra time remains can be used for leisure, but this should not dominate our lives.  

Let us enter the new year with this spirit—ready to fight, to stand firm, and to grow stronger in truth. The Lord will bless us and grant us His grace.
